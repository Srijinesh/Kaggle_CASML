While he can remember how to play the piano perfectly, he cannot rememberwhat he ate for breakfast just an hour ago (Sacks, 2007). James Wannerton experiences a taste sensation that isassociated with the sound of words. His former girlfriend\u2019s name tastes like rhubarb (Mundasad, 2013). JohnNash is a brilliant mathematician and Nobel Prize winner. However, while he was a professor at MIT, he wouldtell people that the New York Timescontained coded messages from extraterrestrial beings that were intendedfor him. He also began to hear voices and became suspicious of the people around him. Soon thereafter, Nashwas diagnosed with schizophrenia and admitted to a state-run mental institution (O\u2019Connor & Robertson,"

What are prejudice and discrimination? What is consciousness? The field of psychologyexplores questions like these. Psychology refers to the scientific study of the mind and behavior. Psychologistsuse the scientific method to acquire knowledge. To apply the scientific method, a researcher with a questionabout how or why something happens will propose a tentative explanation, called a hypothesis, to explain thephenomenon. A hypothesis should fit into the context of a scientific theory, which is a broad explanation orgroup of explanations for some aspect of the natural world that is consistently supported by evidence overtime. A theory is the best understanding we have of that part of the natural world. The researcher then makesobservations or carries out an experiment to test the validity of the hypothesis. Those results are thenpublished or presented at research conferences so that others can replicate or build on the results.Scientists test that which is perceivable and measurable. For example, the hypothesis that a bird sings becauseit is happy is not a hypothesis that can be tested since we have no way to measure the happiness of a bird. Wemust ask a different question, perhaps about the brain state of the bird, since this can be measured. However,we can ask individuals about whether they sing because they are happy since they are able to tell us. Thus,psychological science is empirical, based on measurable data.In general, science deals only with matter and energy, that is, those things that can be measured, and it cannotarrive at knowledge about values and morality. This is one reason why our scientific understanding of themind is so limited, since thoughts, at least as we experience them, are neither matter nor energy. The scientificmethod is also a form of empiricism. An empirical method for acquiring knowledge is one based onobservation, including experimentation, rather than a method based only on forms of logical argument orprevious authorities.It was not until the late 1800s that psychology became accepted as its own academic discipline. Before thistime, the workings of the mind were considered under the auspices of philosophy. Given that any behavior is,at its roots, biological, some areas of psychology take on aspects of a natural science like biology. No biologicalorganism exists in isolation, and our behavior is influenced by our interactions with others. Therefore,psychology is also a social science.WHY STUDY PSYCHOLOGY?Often, students take their first psychology course because they are interested in helping others and want tolearn more about themselves and why they act the way they do. Sometimes, students take a psychology coursebecause it either satisfies a general education requirement or is required for a program of study such asnursing or pre-med. Many of these students develop such an interest in the area that they go on to declarepsychology as their major. As a result, psychology is one of the most popular majors on college campusesacross the United States (Johnson & Lubin, 2011). A number of well-known individuals were psychologymajors. Just a few famous names on this list are Facebook\u2019s creator Mark Zuckerberg, television personalityand political satirist Jon Stewart, actress Natalie Portman, and filmmaker Wes Craven (Halonen, 2011). About6 percent of all bachelor degrees granted in the United States are in the discipline of psychology (U.S.Department of Education, 2016)."

Psychology students hone critical thinkingskills and are trained in the use of the scientific method. Critical thinking is the active application of a set ofskills to information for the understanding and evaluation of that information. The evaluation ofinformation\u2014assessing its reliability and usefulness\u2014 is an important skill in a world full of competing \u201cfacts,\u201dmany of which are designed to be misleading. For example, critical thinking involves maintaining an attitudeof skepticism, recognizing internal biases, making use of logical thinking, asking appropriate questions, andmaking observations. Psychology students also can develop better communication skills during the course oftheir undergraduate coursework (American Psychological Association, 2011). Together, these factors increasestudents\u2019 scientific literacy and prepare students to critically evaluate the various sources of information theyencounter.In addition to these broad-based skills, psychology students come to understand the complex factors thatshape one\u2019s behavior. They appreciate the interaction of our biology, our environment, and our experiences indetermining who we are and how we will behave. They learn about basic principles that guide how we thinkand behave, and they come to recognize the tremendous diversity that exists across individuals and acrosscultural boundaries (American Psychological Association, 2011).LINK TO LEARNINGWatch a brief video about some questions to consider before deciding to major in psychology(http://openstax.org/l/psycmajor) to learn more."

As mentioned, anyone interested in exploring issuesrelated to the mind generally did so in a philosophical context prior to the 19th century. Two 19th centuryscholars, Wilhelm Wundt and William James, are generally credited as being the founders of psychology as ascience and academic discipline that was distinct from philosophy. This section will provide an overview of theshifts in paradigms that have influenced psychology from Wundt and James through today.Wundt and StructuralismWilhelm Wundt (1832\u20131920) was a German scientist who was the first person to be referred to as apsychologist. His famous book entitled Principles of Physiological Psychologywas published in 1873. Wundtviewed psychology as a scientific study of conscious experience, and he believed that the goal of psychologywas to identify components of consciousness and how those components combined to result in our consciousexperience. Wundt used introspection (he called it \u201cinternal perception\u201d), a process by which someoneexamines their own conscious experience as objectively as possible, making the human mind like any otheraspect of nature that a scientist observed. He believed in the notion of voluntarism\u2014that people have free willand should know the intentions of a psychological experiment if they were participating (Danziger, 1980).Wundt considered his version experimental introspection; he used instruments such as those that measuredreaction time. He also wrote Volkerpsychologiein 1904 in which he suggested that psychology should includethe study of culture, as it involves the study of people. Edward Titchener, one of his students, went on to"

Wundt established his psychology laboratory at the University at Leipzig in 1879 (Figure1.2). In this laboratory, Wundt and his students conducted experiments on, for example, reaction times. Asubject, sometimes in a room isolated from the scientist, would receive a stimulus such as a light, image, orsound. The subject\u2019s reaction to the stimulus would be to push a button, and an apparatus would record thetime to reaction. Wundt could measure reaction time to one-thousandth of a second (Nicolas & Ferrand, 1999).FIGURE 1.2 (a) Wilhelm Wundt is credited as one of the founders of psychology. He created the first laboratory forpsychological research. (b) This photo shows him seated and surrounded by fellow researchers and equipment inhis laboratory in Germany.However, despite his efforts to train individuals in the process of introspection, this process remained highlysubjective, and there was very little agreement between individuals.FunctionalismWilliam James, John Dewey, and Charles Sanders Peirce helped establish functional psychology (Figure 1.3).They accepted Darwin\u2019s theory of evolution by natural selection and viewed this theory as an explanation of anorganism\u2019s characteristics. Key to that theory is the idea that natural selection leads to organisms that areadapted to their environment, including their behavior. Adaptation means that a trait of an organism has afunction for the survival and reproduction of the individual, because it has been naturally selected. As Jamessaw it, psychology\u2019s purpose was to study the function of behavior in the world, and as such, his perspectivewas known as functionalism. Functionalism focused on how mental activities helped an organism fit into itsenvironment. Functionalism has a second, more subtle meaning in that functionalists were more interested inthe operation of the whole mind rather than of its individual parts, which were the focus of structuralism. LikeWundt, James believed that introspection could serve as one means by which someone might study mentalactivities, but James also relied on more objective measures, including the use of various recording devices,and examinations of concrete products of mental activities and of anatomy and physiology (Gordon, 1995)."

Freud (1856\u20131939) was an Austrian neurologist who was fascinated by patients suffering from \u201chysteria\u201dand neurosis. Hysteria was an ancient diagnosis for disorders, primarily of women with a wide variety ofsymptoms, including physical symptoms and emotional disturbances, none of which had an apparent physicalcause. Freud theorized that many of his patients\u2019 problems arose from the unconscious mind. In Freud\u2019s view,the unconscious mind was a repository of feelings and urges of which we have no awareness. Gaining access tothe unconscious, then, was crucial to the successful resolution of the patient\u2019s problems. According to Freud,the unconscious mind could be accessed through dream analysis, by examinations of the first words that cameto people\u2019s minds, and through seemingly innocent slips of the tongue. Psychoanalytic theory focuses on therole of a person\u2019s unconscious, as well as early childhood experiences, and this particular perspectivedominated clinical psychology for several decades (Thorne & Henley, 2005).FIGURE 1.4 (a) Sigmund Freud was a highly influential figure in the history of psychology.

The method of psychoanalysis, which involves thepatient talking about their experiences and selves, while not invented by Freud, was certainly popularized byhim and is still used today. Many of Freud\u2019s other ideas, however, are controversial. Drew Westen (1998) arguesthat many of the criticisms of Freud\u2019s ideas are misplaced, in that they attack his older ideas without takinginto account later writings. Westen also argues that critics fail to consider the success of the broad ideas thatFreud introduced or developed, such as the importance of childhood experiences in adult motivations, the roleof unconscious versus conscious motivations in driving our behavior, the fact that motivations can causeconflicts that affect behavior, the effects of mental representations of ourselves and others in guiding ourinteractions, and the development of personality over time. Westen identifies subsequent research support forall of these ideas.More modern iterations of Freud\u2019s clinical approach have been empirically demonstrated to be effective (Knektet al., 2008; Shedler, 2010). Some current practices in psychotherapy involve examining unconscious aspectsof the self and relationships, often through the relationship between the therapist and the client. Freud\u2019shistorical significance and contributions to clinical practice merit his inclusion in a discussion of the historicalmovements within psychology.Wertheimer, Koffka, K\u00f6hler, and Gestalt PsychologyMax Wertheimer (1880\u20131943), Kurt Koffka (1886\u20131941), and Wolfgang K\u00f6hler (1887\u20131967) were threeGerman psychologists who immigrated to the United States in the early 20th century to escape Nazi Germany.These scholars are credited with introducing psychologists in the United States to various Gestalt principles.The word Gestalt roughly translates to \u201cwhole;\u201d a major emphasis of Gestalt psychology deals with the fact thatalthough a sensory experience can be broken down into individual parts, how those parts relate to each otheras a whole is often what the individual responds to in perception. For example, a song may be made up ofindividual notes played by different instruments, but the real nature of the song is perceived in thecombinations of these notes as they form the melody, rhythm, and harmony. In many ways, this particularperspective would have directly contradicted Wundt\u2019s ideas of structuralism (Thorne & Henley, 2005).Unfortunately, in moving to the United States, these scientists were forced to abandon much of their work andwere unable to continue to conduct research on a large scale. These factors along with the rise of behaviorism(described next) in the United States prevented principles of Gestalt psychology from being as influential inthe United States as they had been in their native Germany (Thorne & Henley, 2005). Despite these issues,several Gestalt principles are still very influential today. Considering the human individual as a whole ratherthan as a sum of individually measured parts became an important foundation in humanistic theory late in thecentury. The ideas of Gestalt have continued to influence research on sensation and perception.Structuralism, Freud, and the Gestalt psychologists were all concerned in one way or another with describingand understanding inner experience. But other researchers had concerns that inner experience could be alegitimate subject of scientific inquiry and chose instead to exclusively study behavior, the objectivelyobservable outcome of mental processes.Pavlov, Watson, Skinner, and BehaviorismEarly work in the field of behavior was conducted by the Russian physiologist Ivan Pavlov (1849\u20131936). Pavlovstudied a form of learning behavior called a conditioned reflex, in which an animal or human produced areflex (unconscious) response to a stimulus and, over time, was conditioned to produce the response to adifferent stimulus that the experimenter associated with the original stimulus. The reflex Pavlov worked withwas salivation in response to the presence of food. The salivation reflex could be elicited using a secondstimulus, such as a specific sound, that was presented in association with the initial food stimulus severaltimes. Once the response to the second stimulus was \u201clearned,\u201d the food stimulus could be omitted. Pavlov\u2019s\u201cclassical conditioning\u201d is only one form of learning behavior studied by behaviorists.John B. Watson (1878\u20131958) was an influential American psychologist whose most famous work occurred"

While Wundt and James wereconcerned with understanding conscious experience, Watson thought that the study of consciousness wasflawed. Because he believed that objective analysis of the mind was impossible, Watson preferred to focusdirectly on observable behavior and try to bring that behavior under control. Watson was a major proponent ofshifting the focus of psychology from the mind to behavior, and this approach of observing and controllingbehavior came to be known as behaviorism. A major object of study by behaviorists was learned behavior andits interaction with inborn qualities of the organism. Behaviorism commonly used animals in experimentsunder the assumption that what was learned using animal models could, to some degree, be applied to humanbehavior. Indeed, Tolman (1938) stated, \u201cI believe that everything important in psychology (except \u2026 suchmatters as involve society and words) can be investigated in essence through the continued experimental andtheoretical analysis of the determiners of rat behavior at a choice-point in a maze.\u201dFIGURE 1.5 John B. Watson is known as the father of behaviorism within psychology.Behaviorism dominated experimental psychology for several decades, and its influence can still be felt today(Thorne & Henley, 2005). Behaviorism is largely responsible for establishing psychology as a scientificdiscipline through its objective methods and especially experimentation. In addition, it is used in behavioraland cognitive-behavioral therapy. Behavior modification is commonly used in classroom settings. Behaviorismhas also led to research on environmental influences on human behavior.B. F. Skinner (1904\u20131990) was an American psychologist (Figure 1.6). Like Watson, Skinner was a behaviorist,and he concentrated on how behavior was affected by its consequences. Therefore, Skinner spoke ofreinforcement and punishment as major factors in driving behavior. As a part of his research, Skinnerdeveloped a chamber that allowed the careful study of the principles of modifying behavior throughreinforcement and punishment. This device, known as an operant conditioning chamber (or more familiarly, aSkinner box), has remained a crucial resource for researchers studying behavior (Thorne & Henley, 2005).FIGURE 1.6 (a) B. F. Skinner is famous for his research on operant conditioning. (b) Modified versions of the operantconditioning chamber, or Skinner box, are still widely used in research settings today.

When the animal pushes the button or lever, the box is able to deliver apositive reinforcement of the behavior (such as food) or a punishment (such as a noise).Skinner\u2019s focus on positive and negative reinforcement of learned behaviors had a lasting influence inpsychology that has waned somewhat since the growth of research in cognitive psychology. Despite this,conditioned learning is still used in human behavioral modification (Greengrass, 2004).Maslow, Rogers, and HumanismDuring the early 20th century, American psychology was dominated by behaviorism and psychoanalysis.However, some psychologists were uncomfortable with what they viewed as limited perspectives being soinfluential to the field. They objected to the pessimism and determinism (all actions driven by theunconscious) of Freud. They also disliked the reductionism, or simplifying nature, of behaviorism.Behaviorism is also deterministic at its core, because it sees human behavior as entirely determined by acombination of genetics and environment. Some psychologists began to form their own ideas that emphasizedpersonal control, intentionality, and a true predisposition for \u201cgood\u201d as important for our self-concept and ourbehavior. Thus, humanism emerged. Humanism is a perspective within psychology that emphasizes thepotential for good that is innate to all humans. Two of the most well-known proponents of humanisticpsychology are Abraham Maslow and Carl Rogers (O\u2019Hara, n.d.).Abraham Maslow (1908\u20131970) was an American psychologist who is best known for proposing a hierarchy ofhuman needs in motivating behavior (Figure 1.7). Although this concept will be discussed in more detail in alater chapter, a brief overview will be provided here. Maslow asserted that so long as basic needs necessary forsurvival were met (e.g., food, water, shelter), higher-level needs (e.g., social needs) would begin to motivatebehavior. According to Maslow, the highest-level needs relate to self-actualization, a process by which weachieve our full potential. Obviously, the focus on the positive aspects of human nature that are characteristicof the humanistic perspective is evident (Thorne & Henley, 2005). Humanistic psychologists rejected, onprinciple, the research approach based on reductionist experimentation in the tradition of the physical andbiological sciences, because it missed the \u201cwhole\u201d human being. Beginning with Maslow and Rogers, there wasan insistence on a humanistic research program. This program has been largely qualitative (notmeasurement-based), but there exist a number of quantitative research strains within humanistic psychology,including research on happiness, self-concept, meditation, and the outcomes of humanistic psychotherapy(Friedman, 2008)."

Rogers used a therapeutic technique known as client-centeredtherapy in helping his clients deal with problematic issues that resulted in their seeking psychotherapy. Unlikea psychoanalytic approach in which the therapist plays an important role in interpreting what consciousbehavior reveals about the unconscious mind, client-centered therapy involves the patient taking a lead role inthe therapy session. Rogers believed that a therapist needed to display three features to maximize theeffectiveness of this particular approach: unconditional positive regard, genuineness, and empathy.Unconditional positive regard refers to the fact that the therapist accepts their client for who they are, nomatter what they might say. Provided these factors, Rogers believed that people were more than capable ofdealing with and working through their own issues (Thorne & Henley, 2005).FIGURE 1.8 Carl Rogers, shown in this portrait, developed a client-centered therapy method that has beeninfluential in clinical settings. (credit: \"Didius\"/Wikimedia Commons)Humanism has been influential to psychology as a whole.

The early work of the humanistic psychologists redirectedattention to the individual human as a whole, and as a conscious and self-aware being. By the 1950s, newdisciplinary perspectives in linguistics, neuroscience, and computer science were emerging, and these areasrevived interest in the mind as a focus of scientific inquiry. This particular perspective has come to be knownas the cognitive revolution (Miller, 2003). By 1967, Ulric Neisser published the first textbook entitled CognitivePsychology, which served as a core text in cognitive psychology courses around the country (Thorne & Henley,2005).Although no one person is entirely responsible for starting the cognitive revolution, Noam Chomsky was veryinfluential in the early days of this movement (Figure 1.9). Chomsky (1928\u2013), an American linguist, wasdissatisfied with the influence that behaviorism had had on psychology. He believed that psychology\u2019s focus onbehavior was short-sighted and that the field had to re-incorporate mental functioning into its purview if itwere to offer any meaningful contributions to understanding behavior (Miller, 2003).FIGURE 1.9 Noam Chomsky was very influential in beginning the cognitive revolution. In 2010, this mural honoringhim was put up in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. (credit: Robert Moran)European psychology had never really been as influenced by behaviorism as had American psychology; andthus, the cognitive revolution helped reestablish lines of communication between European psychologists andtheir American counterparts. Furthermore, psychologists began to cooperate with scientists in other fields,like anthropology, linguistics, computer science, and neuroscience, among others. This interdisciplinaryapproach often was referred to as the cognitive sciences, and the influence and prominence of this particularperspective resonates in modern-day psychology (Miller, 2003).DIG DEEPERFeminist PsychologyThe science of psychology has had an impact on human wellbeing, both positive and negative. The dominantinfluence of Western, White, and male academics in the early history of psychology meant that psychologydeveloped with the biases inherent in those individuals, which often had negative consequences for members ofsociety who were not White or male. Women, members of ethnic minorities in both the United States and othercountries, and individuals with sexual orientations other than straight had difficulties entering the field ofpsychology and therefore influencing its development. They also suffered from the attitudes of White malepsychologists who were not immune to the nonscientific attitudes prevalent in the society in which they"

Until the 1960s, the science of psychology was largely a \u201cwomanless\u201d psychology(Crawford & Marecek, 1989), meaning that few women were able to practice psychology, so they had littleinfluence on what was studied. In addition, the experimental subjects of psychology were mostly men, whichresulted from underlying assumptions that gender had no influence on psychology and that women were not ofsufficient interest to study.An article by Naomi Weisstein, first published in 1968 (Weisstein, 1993), stimulated a feminist revolution inpsychology by presenting a critique of psychology as a science. She also specifically criticized male psychologistsfor constructing the psychology of women entirely out of their own cultural biases and without carefulexperimental tests to verify any of their characterizations of women. Weisstein used, as examples, statements byprominent psychologists in the 1960s, such as this quote by Bruno Bettleheim: \u201cWe must start with therealization that, as much as women want to be good scientists or engineers, they want first and foremost to bewomanly companions of men and to be mothers.\u201d Weisstein\u2019s critique formed the foundation for the subsequentdevelopment of a feminist psychology that attempted to be free of the influence of male cultural biases on ourknowledge of the psychology of women.Crawford & Marecek (1989) identify several feminist approaches to psychology that can be described as feministpsychology. These include re-evaluating and discovering the contributions of women to the history of psychology,studying psychological gender differences, and questioning the male bias present across the practice of thescientific approach to knowledge.Multicultural And Cross-Cultural PsychologyCulture impacts individuals, groups, and society. An ongoing issue researchers are trying to correct is thatcertain populations have been over-studied and the results of these studies have been applied to otherpopulations. For example, Henrich, Heine, and Norenzayan discuss how WEIRD societies have beenoverstudied and the results have been wrongly applied to non-WEIRD societies (2010). WEIRD stands forwestern, educated, industrialized, rich, and democratic. Henrich, Heine, and Norenzayan found that there aremany differences between people in the WEIRD group and people in less industrialized, less urban, and non-Western societies. These differences occur in a variety of areas, including perception, cooperation, and moralreasoning. That is, people vary depending on their culture and environment. Multicultural psychologistsdevelop theories and conduct research with diverse populations, typically within one country. Cross-culturalpsychologists compare populations across countries, such as participants from the United States compared toparticipants from China.In 1920, Francis Cecil Sumner was the first African American to receive a PhD in psychology in the UnitedStates. Sumner established a psychology degree program at Howard University, leading to the education of anew generation of African American psychologists (Black, Spence, and Omari, 2004). Much of the work of earlypsychologists from diverse backgrounds was dedicated to challenging intelligence testing and promotinginnovative educational methods for children. George I. Sanchez contested such testing with Mexican Americanchildren. As a psychologist of Mexican heritage, he pointed out that the language and cultural barriers intesting were keeping children from equal opportunities (Guthrie, 1998). By 1940, he was teaching with hisdoctoral degree at University of Texas at Austin and challenging segregated educational practices (Romo,1986).Two famous African American researchers and psychologists are Mamie Phipps Clark and her husband,Kenneth Clark. They are best known for their studies conducted on African American children and dollpreference, research that was instrumental in the Brown v. Board of EducationSupreme Court desegregationcase. The Clarks applied their research to social services and opened the first child guidance center in Harlem(American Psychological Association, 2019).Listen to the podcast below describing the Clarks' research and impact on the Supreme Court decision."

Since psychologists belonging to specific ethnicgroups or cultures have the most interest in studying the psychology of their communities, these organizationsprovide an opportunity for the growth of research on the interplay between culture and psychology.WOMEN IN PSYCHOLOGYAlthough rarely given credit, women have been contributing to psychology since its inception as a field ofstudy. In 1894, Margaret Floy Washburn was the first woman awarded the doctoral degree in psychology. Shewrote The Animal Mind: A Textbook of Comparative Psychology, and it was the standard in the field for over 20years. In the mid 1890s, Mary Whiton Calkins completed all requirements toward the PhD in psychology, butHarvard University refused to award her that degree because she was a woman. She had been taught andmentored by William James, who tried and failed to convince Harvard to award her the doctoral degree. Hermemory research studied primacy and recency (Madigan & O\u2019Hara, 1992), and she also wrote about howstructuralism and functionalism both explained self-psychology (Calkins, 1906).Another influential woman, Mary Cover Jones, conducted a study she considered to be a sequel to John B.Watson\u2019s study of Little Albert (you\u2019ll learn about this study in the chapter on Learning). Jones unconditionedfear in Little Peter, who had been afraid of rabbits (Jones, 1924).Ethnic minority women contributing to the field of psychology include Martha Bernal and Inez Beverly Prosser;their studies were related to education. Bernal, the first Latina to earn her doctoral degree in psychology(1962) conducted much of her research with Mexican American children. Prosser was the first AfricanAmerican woman awarded the PhD in 1933 at the University of Cincinnati (Benjamin, Henry, & McMahon,2005)."

While biologicalpsychology is a broad field, many biological psychologists want to understand how the structure and functionof the nervous system is related to behavior (Figure 1.10). As such, they often combine the research strategiesof both psychologists and physiologists to accomplish this goal (as discussed in Carlson, 2013).FIGURE 1.10 Biological psychologists study how the structure and function of the nervous system generatebehavior.The research interests of biological psychologists span a number of domains, including but not limited to,"

This interdisciplinary approach is often referred to asneuroscience, of which biological psychology is a component (Carlson, 2013).While biopsychology typically focuses on the immediate causes of behavior based in the physiology of ahuman or other animal, evolutionary psychology seeks to study the ultimate biological causes of behavior. Tothe extent that a behavior is impacted by genetics, a behavior, like any anatomical characteristic of a human oranimal, will demonstrate adaption to its surroundings. These surroundings include the physical environmentand, since interactions between organisms can be important to survival and reproduction, the socialenvironment. The study of behavior in the context of evolution has its origins with Charles Darwin, the co-discoverer of the theory of evolution by natural selection. Darwin was well aware that behaviors should beadaptive and wrote books titled, The Descent of Man(1871) and The Expression of the Emotions in Man andAnimals(1872), to explore this field.Evolutionary psychology, and specifically, the evolutionary psychology of humans, has enjoyed a resurgence inrecent decades. To be subject to evolution by natural selection, a behavior must have a significant geneticcause. In general, we expect all human cultures to express a behavior if it is caused genetically, since thegenetic differences among human groups are small. The approach taken by most evolutionary psychologists isto predict the outcome of a behavior in a particular situation based on evolutionary theory and then to makeobservations, or conduct experiments, to determine whether the results match the theory. It is important torecognize that these types of studies are not strong evidence that a behavior is adaptive, since they lackinformation that the behavior is in some part genetic and not entirely cultural (Endler, 1986). Demonstratingthat a trait, especially in humans, is naturally selected is extraordinarily difficult; perhaps for this reason,some evolutionary psychologists are content to assume the behaviors they study have genetic determinants(Confer et al., 2010).One other drawback of evolutionary psychology is that the traits that we possess now evolved underenvironmental and social conditions far back in human history, and we have a poor understanding of whatthese conditions were. This makes predictions about what is adaptive for a behavior difficult. Behavioral traitsneed not be adaptive under current conditions, only under the conditions of the past when they evolved, aboutwhich we can only hypothesize.There are many areas of human behavior for which evolution can make predictions. Examples includememory, mate choice, relationships between kin, friendship and cooperation, parenting, social organization,and status (Confer et al., 2010).Evolutionary psychologists have had success in finding experimental correspondence between observationsand expectations. In one example, in a study of mate preference differences between men and women thatspanned 37 cultures, Buss (1989) found that women valued earning potential factors greater than men, andmen valued potential reproductive factors (youth and attractiveness) greater than women in their prospectivemates. In general, the predictions were in line with the predictions of evolution, although there were deviationsin some cultures.Sensation and PerceptionScientists interested in both physiological aspects of sensory systems as well as in the psychologicalexperience of sensory information work within the area of sensation and perception (Figure 1.11). As such,sensation and perception research is also quite interdisciplinary. Imagine walking between buildings as youmove from one class to another. You are inundated with sights, sounds, touch sensations, and smells. You alsoexperience the temperature of the air around you and maintain your balance as you make your way. These are"

The sensory information remains thesame, but your perception can vary dramatically.As described in a later chapter that focuses on the results of studies in sensation and perception, ourexperience of our world is not as simple as the sum total of all of the sensory information (or sensations)together. Rather, our experience (or perception) is complex and is influenced by where we focus our attention,our previous experiences, and even our cultural backgrounds.Cognitive PsychologyAs mentioned in the previous section, the cognitive revolution created an impetus for psychologists to focustheir attention on better understanding the mind and mental processes that underlie behavior. Thus, cognitivepsychology is the area of psychology that focuses on studying cognitions, or thoughts, and their relationship toour experiences and our actions. Like biological psychology, cognitive psychology is broad in its scope andoften involves collaborations among people from a diverse range of disciplinary backgrounds. This has ledsome to coin the term cognitive science to describe the interdisciplinary nature of this area of research (Miller,2003).Cognitive psychologists have research interests that span a spectrum of topics, ranging from attention toproblem solving to language to memory. The approaches used in studying these topics are equally diverse.Given such diversity, cognitive psychology is not captured in one chapter of this text per se; rather, variousconcepts related to cognitive psychology will be covered in relevant portions of the chapters in this text onsensation and perception, thinking and intelligence, memory, lifespan development, social psychology, andtherapy.Developmental PsychologyDevelopmental psychology is the scientific study of development across a lifespan. Developmentalpsychologists are interested in processes related to physical maturation. However, their focus is not limited tothe physical changes associated with aging, as they also focus on changes in cognitive skills, moral reasoning,social behavior, and other psychological attributes.Early developmental psychologists focused primarily on changes that occurred through reaching adulthood,providing enormous insight into the differences in physical, cognitive, and social capacities that exist betweenvery young children and adults. For instance, research by Jean Piaget (Figure 1.12) demonstrated that veryyoung children do not demonstrate object permanence. Object permanence refers to the understanding thatphysical things continue to exist, even if they are hidden from us. If you were to show an adult a toy, and thenhide it behind a curtain, the adult knows that the toy still exists. However, very young infants act as if a hiddenobject no longer exists. The age at which object permanence is achieved is somewhat controversial (Munakata,McClelland, Johnson, and Siegler, 1997)."

This may bereflective of changing population demographics of developed nations as a whole. As more and more people livelonger lives, the number of people of advanced age will continue to increase. Indeed, it is estimated that therewere just over 40 million people aged 65 or older living in the United States in 2010. However, by 2020, thisnumber is expected to increase to about 55 million. By the year 2050, it is estimated that nearly 90 millionpeople in this country will be 65 or older (Department of Health and Human Services, n.d.).Personality PsychologyPersonality psychology focuses on patterns of thoughts and behaviors that make each individual unique.Several individuals (e.g., Freud and Maslow) that we have already discussed in our historical overview ofpsychology, and the American psychologist Gordon Allport, contributed to early theories of personality. Theseearly theorists attempted to explain how an individual\u2019s personality develops from their given perspective. Forexample, Freud proposed that personality arose as conflicts between the conscious and unconscious parts ofthe mind were carried out over the lifespan. Specifically, Freud theorized that an individual went throughvarious psychosexual stages of development. According to Freud, adult personality would result from theresolution of various conflicts that centered on the migration of erogenous (or sexual pleasure-producing)zones from the oral (mouth) to the anus to the phallus to the genitals. Like many of Freud\u2019s theories, thisparticular idea was controversial and did not lend itself to experimental tests (Person, 1980).More recently, the study of personality has taken on a more quantitative approach. Rather than explaining howpersonality arises, research is focused on identifying personality traits, measuring these traits, anddetermining how these traits interact in a particular context to determine how a person will behave in anygiven situation. Personality traits are relatively consistent patterns of thought and behavior, and many haveproposed that five trait dimensions are sufficient to capture the variations in personality seen acrossindividuals. These five dimensions are known as the \u201cBig Five\u201d or the Five Factor model, and includedimensions of conscientiousness, agreeableness, neuroticism, openness, and extraversion (Figure 1.13). Eachof these traits has been demonstrated to be relatively stable over the lifespan (e.g., Rantanen, Mets\u00e4pelto, Feldt,Pulkinnen, and Kokko, 2007; Soldz & Vaillant, 1999; McCrae & Costa, 2008) and is influenced by genetics (e.g.,Jang, Livesly, and Vernon, 1996)."

The provided descriptionwould describe someone who scored highly on that given dimension. Someone with a lower score on a givendimension could be described in opposite terms.Social PsychologySocial psychology focuses on how we interact with and relate to others. Social psychologists conduct researchon a wide variety of topics that include differences in how we explain our own behavior versus how we explainthe behaviors of others, prejudice, and attraction, and how we resolve interpersonal conflicts. Socialpsychologists have also sought to determine how being among other people changes our own behavior andpatterns of thinking.There are many interesting examples of social psychological research, and you will read about many of thesein a later chapter of this textbook. Until then, you will be introduced to one of the most controversialpsychological studies ever conducted. Stanley Milgram was an American social psychologist who is mostfamous for research that he conducted on obedience. After the holocaust, in 1961, a Nazi war criminal, AdolfEichmann, who was accused of committing mass atrocities, was put on trial. Many people wondered howGerman soldiers were capable of torturing prisoners in concentration camps, and they were unsatisfied withthe excuses given by soldiers that they were simply following orders. At the time, most psychologists agreedthat few people would be willing to inflict such extraordinary pain and suffering, simply because they wereobeying orders. Milgram decided to conduct research to determine whether or not this was true (Figure 1.14).As you will read later in the text, Milgram found that nearly two-thirds of his participants were willing todeliver what they believed to be lethal shocks to another person, simply because they were instructed to do soby an authority figure (in this case, a man dressed in a lab coat). This was in spite of the fact that participants"

I-O psychologists are ofteninvolved in issues related to personnel management, organizational structure, and workplace environment.Businesses often seek the aid of I-O psychologists to make the best hiring decisions as well as to create anenvironment that results in high levels of employee productivity and efficiency. In addition to its appliednature, I-O psychology also involves conducting scientific research on behavior within I-O settings (Riggio,2013)."

This particular approach is known as the biopsychosocial model (Figure 1.15). Healthpsychologists are interested in helping individuals achieve better health through public policy, education,intervention, and research. Health psychologists might conduct research that explores the relationshipbetween one\u2019s genetic makeup, patterns of behavior, relationships, psychological stress, and health. They mayresearch effective ways to motivate people to address patterns of behavior that contribute to poorer health(MacDonald, 2013).FIGURE 1.15 The biopsychosocial model suggests that health/illness is determined by an interaction of these threefactors.Sport and Exercise PsychologyResearchers in sport and exercise psychology study the psychological aspects of sport performance,including motivation and performance anxiety, and the effects of sport on mental and emotional wellbeing.Research is also conducted on similar topics as they relate to physical exercise in general. The discipline alsoincludes topics that are broader than sport and exercise but that are related to interactions between mentaland physical performance under demanding conditions, such as fire fighting, military operations, artisticperformance, and surgery.Clinical PsychologyClinical psychology is the area of psychology that focuses on the diagnosis and treatment of psychologicaldisorders and other problematic patterns of behavior. As such, it is generally considered to be a more appliedarea within psychology; however, some clinicians are also actively engaged in scientific research. Counselingpsychology is a similar discipline that focuses on emotional, social, vocational, and health-related outcomes inindividuals who are considered psychologically healthy.As mentioned earlier, both Freud and Rogers provided perspectives that have been influential in shaping howclinicians interact with people seeking psychotherapy. While aspects of the psychoanalytic theory are stillfound among some of today\u2019s therapists who are trained from a psychodynamic perspective, Roger\u2019s ideasabout client-centered therapy have been especially influential in shaping how many clinicians operate.Furthermore, both behaviorism and the cognitive revolution have shaped clinical practice in the forms ofbehavioral therapy, cognitive therapy, and cognitive-behavioral therapy (Figure 1.16).

For example, forensic psychologists (and forensic psychiatrists) will assess a person\u2019scompetency to stand trial, assess the state of mind of a defendant, act as consultants on child custody cases,consult on sentencing and treatment recommendations, and advise on issues such as eyewitness testimonyand children\u2019s testimony (American Board of Forensic Psychology, 2014). In these capacities, they will typicallyact as expert witnesses, called by either side in a court case to provide their research- or experience-basedopinions. As expert witnesses, forensic psychologists must have a good understanding of the law and provideinformation in the context of the legal system rather than just within the realm of psychology. Forensicpsychologists are also used in the jury selection process and witness preparation. They may also be involved inproviding psychological treatment within the criminal justice system. Criminal profilers are a relatively smallproportion of psychologists that act as consultants to law enforcement."

Furthermore, many 2-yearcolleges and schools need faculty to teach their courses in psychology. In general, many of the people whopursue careers at these institutions have master\u2019s degrees in psychology, although some PhDs make careers atthese institutions as well.Some people earning PhDs may enjoy research in an academic setting. However, they may not be interested inteaching. These individuals might take on faculty positions that are exclusively devoted to conductingresearch. This type of position would be more likely an option at large, research-focused universities.In some areas in psychology, it is common for individuals who have recently earned their PhD to seek outpositions in postdoctoral training programs that are available before going on to serve as faculty. In mostcases, young scientists will complete one or two postdoctoral programs before applying for a full-time facultyposition. Postdoctoral training programs allow young scientists to further develop their research programsand broaden their research skills under the supervision of other professionals in the field.Career Options Outside of Academic SettingsIndividuals who wish to become practicing clinical psychologists have another option for earning a doctoraldegree, which is known as a PsyD. A PsyD is a doctor of psychology degree that is increasingly popular amongindividuals interested in pursuing careers in clinical psychology. PsyD programs generally place less emphasison research-oriented skills and focus more on application of psychological principles in the clinical context(Norcross & Castle, 2002).Regardless of whether earning a PhD or PsyD, in most states, an individual wishing to practice as a licensedclinical or counseling psychologist may complete postdoctoral work under the supervision of a licensedpsychologist. Within the last few years, however, several states have begun to remove this requirement, whichwould allow people to get an earlier start in their careers (Munsey, 2009). After an individual has met the staterequirements, their credentials are evaluated to determine whether they can sit for the licensure exam. Onlyindividuals that pass this exam can call themselves licensed clinical or counseling psychologists (Norcross,n.d.). Licensed clinical or counseling psychologists can then work in a number of settings, ranging from privateclinical practice to hospital settings. It should be noted that clinical psychologists and psychiatrists do differentthings and receive different types of education. While both can conduct therapy and counseling, clinicalpsychologists have a PhD or a PsyD, whereas psychiatrists have a doctor of medicine degree (MD). As such,licensed clinical psychologists can administer and interpret psychological tests, while psychiatrists canprescribe medications.Individuals earning a PhD can work in a variety of settings, depending on their areas of specialization. Forexample, someone trained as a biopsychologist might work in a pharmaceutical company to help test theefficacy of a new drug. Someone with a clinical background might become a forensic psychologist and workwithin the legal system to make recommendations during criminal trials and parole hearings, or serve as anexpert in a court case.While earning a doctoral degree in psychology is a lengthy process, usually taking between 5\u20136 years ofgraduate study (DeAngelis, 2010), there are a number of careers that can be attained with a master\u2019s degree inpsychology. People who wish to provide psychotherapy can become licensed to serve as various types ofprofessional counselors (Hoffman, 2012). Relevant master\u2019s degrees are also sufficient for individuals seekingcareers as school psychologists (National Association of School Psychologists, n.d.), in some capacities relatedto sport psychology (American Psychological Association, 2014), or as consultants in various industrialsettings (Landers, 2011, June 14). Undergraduate coursework in psychology may be applicable to other careerssuch as psychiatric social work or psychiatric nursing, where assessments and therapy may be a part of thejob.As mentioned in the opening section of this chapter, an undergraduate education in psychology is associatedwith a knowledge base and skill set that many employers find quite attractive.

This particularperspective focused on how mental activities served as adaptive responses to an organism\u2019s environment. LikeWundt, James also relied on introspection; however, his research approach also incorporated more objectivemeasures as well.Sigmund Freud believed that understanding the unconscious mind was absolutely critical to understandconscious behavior. This was especially true for individuals that he saw who suffered from various hysteriasand neuroses. Freud relied on dream analysis, slips of the tongue, and free association as means to access theunconscious. Psychoanalytic theory remained a dominant force in clinical psychology for several decades.Gestalt psychology was very influential in Europe. Gestalt psychology takes a holistic view of an individual andhis experiences. As the Nazis came to power in Germany, Wertheimer, Koffka, and K\u00f6hler immigrated to theUnited States. Although they left their laboratories and their research behind, they did introduce America toGestalt ideas. Some of the principles of Gestalt psychology are still very influential in the study of sensationand perception.One of the most influential schools of thought within psychology\u2019s history was behaviorism. Behaviorismfocused on making psychology an objective science by studying overt behavior and deemphasizing theimportance of unobservable mental processes. John Watson is often considered the father of behaviorism, andB. F. Skinner\u2019s contributions to our understanding of principles of operant conditioning cannot beunderestimated.As behaviorism and psychoanalytic theory took hold of so many aspects of psychology, some began to becomedissatisfied with psychology\u2019s picture of human nature. Thus, a humanistic movement within psychologybegan to take hold. Humanism focuses on the potential of all people for good. Both Maslow and Rogers wereinfluential in shaping humanistic psychology.During the 1950s, the landscape of psychology began to change. A science of behavior began to shift back to itsroots of focus on mental processes. The emergence of neuroscience and computer science aided thistransition. Ultimately, the cognitive revolution took hold, and people came to realize that cognition was crucialto a true appreciation and understanding of behavior."

(credit: modification of work by\u201cantisocialtory\u201d/Flickr)Have you ever wondered whether the violence you see on television affects your behavior?INTRODUCTIONAre you more likely to behave aggressively in real life after watching people behave violently in dramaticsituations on the screen? Or, could seeing fictional violence actually get aggression out of your system, causingyou to be more peaceful? How are children influenced by the media they are exposed to? A psychologistinterested in the relationship between behavior and exposure to violent images might ask these veryquestions.Since ancient times, humans have been concerned about the effects of new technologies on our behaviors andthinking processes. The Greek philosopher Socrates, for example, worried that writing\u2014a new technology atthat time\u2014would diminish people\u2019s ability to remember because they could rely on written records rather thancommitting information to memory. In our world of rapidly changing technologies, questions about theireffects on our daily lives and their resulting long-term impacts continue to emerge. In addition to the impact ofscreen time (on smartphones, tablets, computers, and gaming), technology is emerging in our vehicles (suchas GPS and smart cars) and residences (with devices like Alexa or Google Home and doorbell cameras). Asthese technologies become integrated into our lives, we are faced with questions about their positive andnegative impacts. Many of us find ourselves with a strong opinion on these issues, only to find the person nextto us bristling with the opposite view."

Without it, we would beforced to rely solely on intuition, other people\u2019s authority, and blind luck. While many of us feel confident inour abilities to decipher and interact with the world around us, history is filled with examples of how verywrong we can be when we fail to recognize the need for evidence in supporting claims. At various times inhistory, we would have been certain that the sun revolved around a flat earth, that the earth\u2019s continents didnot move, and that mental illness was caused by possession (Figure 2.2). It is through systematic scientificresearch that we divest ourselves of our preconceived notions and superstitions and gain an objectiveunderstanding of ourselves and our world.FIGURE 2.2 Some of our ancestors, across the world and over the centuries, believed that trephination\u2014thepractice of making a hole in the skull, as shown here\u2014allowed evil spirits to leave the body, thus curing mentalillness and other disorders. (credit: \u201ctaiproject\u201d/Flickr)The goal of all scientists is to better understand the world around them. Psychologists focus their attention onunderstanding behavior, as well as the cognitive (mental) and physiological (body) processes that underliebehavior. In contrast to other methods that people use to understand the behavior of others, such as intuitionand personal experience, the hallmark of scientific research is that there is evidence to support a claim.Scientific knowledge is empirical: It is grounded in objective, tangible evidence that can be observed time andtime again, regardless of who is observing.While behavior is observable, the mind is not. If someone is crying, we can see behavior. However, the reasonfor the behavior is more difficult to determine. Is the person crying due to being sad, in pain, or happy?Sometimes we can learn the reason for someone\u2019s behavior by simply asking a question, like \u201cWhy are youcrying?\u201d However, there are situations in which an individual is either uncomfortable or unwilling to answerthe question honestly, or is incapable of answering. For example, infants would not be able to explain why theyare crying. In such circumstances, the psychologist must be creative in finding ways to better understandbehavior. This chapter explores how scientific knowledge is generated, and how important that knowledge is informing decisions in our personal lives and in the public domain."

        "data": "Page 372.1 \u2022 Why Is Research Important? 37Use of Research InformationTrying to determine which theories are and are not accepted by the scientific community can be difficult,especially in an area of research as broad as psychology. More than ever before, we have an incredible amountof information at our fingertips, and a simple internet search on any given research topic might result in anumber of contradictory studies. In these cases, we are witnessing the scientific community going through theprocess of reaching a consensus, and it could be quite some time before a consensus emerges. For example,the explosion in our use of technology has led researchers to question whether this ultimately helps or hindersus. The use and implementation of technology in educational settings has become widespread over the last fewdecades. Researchers are coming to different conclusions regarding the use of technology. To illustrate thispoint, a study investigating a smartphone app targeting surgery residents (graduate students in surgerytraining) found that the use of this app can increase student engagement and raise test scores (Shaw & Tan,2015). Conversely, another study found that the use of technology in undergraduate student populations hadnegative impacts on sleep, communication, and time management skills (Massimini & Peterson, 2009). Untilsufficient amounts of research have been conducted, there will be no clear consensus on the effects thattechnology has on a student's acquisition of knowledge, study skills, and mental health.In the meantime, we should strive to think critically about the information we encounter by exercising a degreeof healthy skepticism. When someone makes a claim, we should examine the claim from a number of differentperspectives: what is the expertise of the person making the claim, what might they gain if the claim is valid,does the claim seem justified given the evidence, and what do other researchers think of the claim? This isespecially important when we consider how much information in advertising campaigns and on the internetclaims to be based on \u201cscientific evidence\u201d when in actuality it is a belief or perspective of just a fewindividuals trying to sell a product or draw attention to their perspectives.We should be informed consumers of the information made available to us because decisions based on thisinformation have significant consequences. One such consequence can be seen in politics and public policy.Imagine that you have been elected as the governor of your state. One of your responsibilities is to manage thestate budget and determine how to best spend your constituents\u2019 tax dollars. As the new governor, you need todecide whether to continue funding early intervention programs. These programs are designed to helpchildren who come from low-income backgrounds, have special needs, or face other disadvantages. Theseprograms may involve providing a wide variety of services to maximize the children's development andposition them for optimal levels of success in school and later in life (Blann, 2005). While such programssound appealing, you would want to be sure that they also proved effective before investing additional moneyin these programs. Fortunately, psychologists and other scientists have conducted vast amounts of research onsuch programs and, in general, the programs are found to be effective (Neil & Christensen, 2009; Peters-Scheffer, Didden, Korzilius, & Sturmey, 2011). While not all programs are equally effective, and the short-termeffects of many such programs are more pronounced, there is reason to believe that many of these programsproduce long-term benefits for participants (Barnett, 2011). If you are committed to being a good steward oftaxpayer money, you would want to look at research. Which programs are most effective? What characteristicsof these programs make them effective? Which programs promote the best outcomes? After examining theresearch, you would be best equipped to make decisions about which programs to fund.LINK TO LEARNINGWatch this video about early childhood program effectiveness (http://openstax.org/l/programeffect) to learnhow scientists evaluate effectiveness and how best to invest money into programs that are most effective.Ultimately, it is not just politicians who can benefit from using research in guiding their decisions. We all mightlook to research from time to time when making decisions in our lives. Imagine you just found out that yoursister Maria's child, Umberto, was recently diagnosed with autism. There are many treatments for autism thathelp decrease the negative impact of autism on the individual. Some examples of treatments for autism are"

If Maria asked you for advice or guidance, what would you do? You would likely wantto review the research and learn about the efficacy of each treatment so you could best advise your sister.In the end, research is what makes the difference between facts and opinions. Facts are observable realities,and opinions are personal judgments, conclusions, or attitudes that may or may not be accurate. In thescientific community, facts can be established only using evidence collected through empirical research.NOTABLE RESEARCHERSPsychological research has a long history involving important figures from diverse backgrounds. While theintroductory chapter discussed several researchers who made significant contributions to the discipline, thereare many more individuals who deserve attention in considering how psychology has advanced as a sciencethrough their work (Figure 2.3). For instance, Margaret Floy Washburn (1871\u20131939) was the first woman toearn a PhD in psychology. Her research focused on animal behavior and cognition (Margaret Floy Washburn,PhD, n.d.). Mary Whiton Calkins (1863\u20131930) was a preeminent first-generation American psychologist whoopposed the behaviorist movement, conducted significant research into memory, and established one of theearliest experimental psychology labs in the United States (Mary Whiton Calkins, n.d.).Francis Sumner (1895\u20131954) was the first African American to receive a PhD in psychology in 1920. Hisdissertation focused on issues related to psychoanalysis. Sumner also had research interests in racial bias andeducational justice. Sumner was one of the founders of Howard University\u2019s department of psychology, andbecause of his accomplishments, he is sometimes referred to as the \u201cFather of Black Psychology.\u201d Thirteenyears later, Inez Beverly Prosser (1895\u20131934) became the first African American woman to receive a PhD inpsychology. Prosser\u2019s research highlighted issues related to education in segregated versus integrated schools,and ultimately, her work was very influential in the hallmark Brown v. Board of EducationSupreme Courtruling that segregation of public schools was unconstitutional (Ethnicity and Health in America Series:Featured Psychologists, n.d.).FIGURE 2.3 (a) Margaret Floy Washburn was the first woman to earn a doctorate degree in psychology. (b) Theoutcome of Brown v. Board of Educationwas influenced by the research of psychologist Inez Beverly Prosser, whowas the first African American woman to earn a PhD in psychology.Although the establishment of psychology\u2019s scientific roots occurred first in Europe and the United States, itdid not take much time until researchers from around the world began to establish their own laboratories andresearch programs. For example, some of the first experimental psychology laboratories in South Americawere founded by Horatio Pi\u00f1ero (1869\u20131919) at two institutions in Buenos Aires, Argentina (Godoy & Brussino,2010).

These developments provided an opportunity for Indian researchers to make importantcontributions to the field (Gunamudian David Boaz, n.d.; Narendra Nath Sen Gupta, n.d.).When the American Psychological Association (APA) was first founded in 1892, all of the members were Whitemales (Women and Minorities in Psychology, n.d.). However, by 1905, Mary Whiton Calkins was elected as thefirst female president of the APA, and by 1946, nearly one-quarter of American psychologists were female.Psychology became a popular degree option for students enrolled in the nation\u2019s historically Black highereducation institutions, increasing the number of Black Americans who went on to become psychologists. Givendemographic shifts occurring in the United States and increased access to higher educational opportunitiesamong historically underrepresented populations, there is reason to hope that the diversity of the field willincreasingly match the larger population, and that the research contributions made by the psychologists of thefuture will better serve people of all backgrounds (Women and Minorities in Psychology, n.d.).The Process of Scientific ResearchScientific knowledge is advanced through a process known as the scientific method. Basically, ideas (in theform of theories and hypotheses) are tested against the real world (in the form of empirical observations), andthose empirical observations lead to more ideas that are tested against the real world, and so on. In this sense,the scientific process is circular. The types of reasoning within the circle are called deductive and inductive. Indeductive reasoning, ideas are tested in the real world; in inductive reasoning, real-world observations leadto new ideas (Figure 2.4). These processes are inseparable, like inhaling and exhaling, but different researchapproaches place different emphasis on the deductive and inductive aspects.FIGURE 2.4 Psychological research relies on both inductive and deductive reasoning.In the scientific context, deductive reasoning begins with a generalization\u2014one hypothesis\u2014that is then usedto reach logical conclusions about the real world. If the hypothesis is correct, then the logical conclusionsreached through deductive reasoning should also be correct. A deductive reasoning argument might gosomething like this: All living things require energy to survive (this would be your hypothesis). Ducks are livingthings. Therefore, ducks require energy to survive (logical conclusion). In this example, the hypothesis iscorrect; therefore, the conclusion is correct as well. Sometimes, however, an incorrect hypothesis may lead to alogical but incorrect conclusion. Consider this argument: all ducks are born with the ability to see. Quackers isa duck. Therefore, Quackers was born with the ability to see. Scientists use deductive reasoning to empiricallytest their hypotheses. Returning to the example of the ducks, researchers might design a study to test thehypothesis that if all living things require energy to survive, then ducks will be found to require energy tosurvive.Deductive reasoning starts with a generalization that is tested against real-world observations; however,inductive reasoning moves in the opposite direction. Inductive reasoning uses empirical observations to"

Unlike deductive reasoning, conclusions drawn from inductive reasoningmay or may not be correct, regardless of the observations on which they are based. For instance, you maynotice that your favorite fruits\u2014apples, bananas, and oranges\u2014all grow on trees; therefore, you assume that allfruit must grow on trees. This would be an example of inductive reasoning, and, clearly, the existence ofstrawberries, blueberries, and kiwi demonstrate that this generalization is not correct despite it being basedon a number of direct observations. Scientists use inductive reasoning to formulate theories, which in turngenerate hypotheses that are tested with deductive reasoning. In the end, science involves both deductive andinductive processes.For example, case studies, which you will read about in the next section, are heavily weighted on the side ofempirical observations. Thus, case studies are closely associated with inductive processes as researchersgather massive amounts of observations and seek interesting patterns (new ideas) in the data. Experimentalresearch, on the other hand, puts great emphasis on deductive reasoning.We\u2019ve stated that theories and hypotheses are ideas, but what sort of ideas are they, exactly? A theory is a well-developed set of ideas that propose an explanation for observed phenomena. Theories are repeatedly checkedagainst the world, but they tend to be too complex to be tested all at once; instead, researchers createhypotheses to test specific aspects of a theory.A hypothesis is a testable prediction about how the world will behave if our idea is correct, and it is oftenworded as an if-then statement (e.g., if I study all night, I will get a passing grade on the test). The hypothesis isextremely important because it bridges the gap between the realm of ideas and the real world. As specifichypotheses are tested, theories are modified and refined to reflect and incorporate the result of these testsFigure 2.5.FIGURE 2.5 The scientific method involves deriving hypotheses from theories and then testing those hypotheses. Ifthe results are consistent with the theory, then the theory is supported. If the results are not consistent, then thetheory should be modified and new hypotheses will be generated.To see how this process works, let\u2019s consider a specific theory and a hypothesis that might be generated fromthat theory. As you\u2019ll learn in a later chapter, the James-Lange theory of emotion asserts that emotionalexperience relies on the physiological arousal associated with the emotional state. If you walked out of yourhome and discovered a very aggressive snake waiting on your doorstep, your heart would begin to race andyour stomach churn. According to the James-Lange theory, these physiological changes would result in your"

A hypothesis that could be derived from this theory might be that a person who is unaware ofthe physiological arousal that the sight of the snake elicits will not feel fear.A scientific hypothesis is also falsifiable, or capable of being shown to be incorrect. Recall from theintroductory chapter that Sigmund Freud had lots of interesting ideas to explain various human behaviors(Figure 2.6). However, a major criticism of Freud\u2019s theories is that many of his ideas are not falsifiable; forexample, it is impossible to imagine empirical observations that would disprove the existence of the id, theego, and the superego\u2014the three elements of personality described in Freud\u2019s theories. Despite this, Freud\u2019stheories are widely taught in introductory psychology texts because of their historical significance forpersonality psychology and psychotherapy, and these remain the root of all modern forms of therapy.FIGURE 2.6 Many of the specifics of (a) Freud's theories, such as (b) his division of the mind into id, ego, andsuperego, have fallen out of favor in recent decades because they are not falsifiable. In broader strokes, his viewsset the stage for much of psychological thinking today, such as the unconscious nature of the majority ofpsychological processes.In contrast, the James-Lange theory does generate falsifiable hypotheses, such as the one described above.Some individuals who suffer significant injuries to their spinal columns are unable to feel the bodily changesthat often accompany emotional experiences. Therefore, we could test the hypothesis by determining howemotional experiences differ between individuals who have the ability to detect these changes in theirphysiological arousal and those who do not. In fact, this research has been conducted and while the emotionalexperiences of people deprived of an awareness of their physiological arousal may be less intense, they stillexperience emotion (Chwalisz, Diener, & Gallagher, 1988).Scientific research\u2019s dependence on falsifiability allows for great confidence in the information that itproduces. Typically, by the time information is accepted by the scientific community, it has been testedrepeatedly."

Other approaches involve interactions between the researcher and the individualswho are being studied\u2014ranging from a series of simple questions to extensive, in-depth interviews\u2014to well-controlled experiments.Each of these research methods has unique strengths and weaknesses, and each method may only beappropriate for certain types of research questions. For example, studies that rely primarily on observationproduce incredible amounts of information, but the ability to apply this information to the larger population issomewhat limited because of small sample sizes. Survey research, on the other hand, allows researchers toeasily collect data from relatively large samples. While this allows for results to be generalized to the largerpopulation more easily, the information that can be collected on any given survey is somewhat limited andsubject to problems associated with any type of self-reported data. Some researchers conduct archivalresearch by using existing records. While this can be a fairly inexpensive way to collect data that can provideinsight into a number of research questions, researchers using this approach have no control on how or whatkind of data was collected. All of the methods described thus far are correlational in nature. This means thatresearchers can speak to important relationships that might exist between two or more variables of interest.However, correlational data cannot be used to make claims about cause-and-effect relationships.Correlational research can find a relationship between two variables, but the only way a researcher can claimthat the relationship between the variables is cause and effect is to perform an experiment. In experimentalresearch, which will be discussed later in this chapter, there is a tremendous amount of control over variablesof interest. While this is a powerful approach, experiments are often conducted in artificial settings. This callsinto question the validity of experimental findings with regard to how they would apply in real-world settings.In addition, many of the questions that psychologists would like to answer cannot be pursued throughexperimental research because of ethical concerns.Clinical or Case StudiesIn 2011, the New York Timespublished a feature story on Krista and Tatiana Hogan, Canadian twin girls.These particular twins are unique because Krista and Tatiana are conjoined twins, connected at the head.There is evidence that the two girls are connected in a part of the brain called the thalamus, which is a majorsensory relay center. Most incoming sensory information is sent through the thalamus before reaching higherregions of the cerebral cortex for processing.LINK TO LEARNINGWatch this CBC video about Krista's and Tatiana's lives (http://openstax.org/l/hogans) to learn more.The implications of this potential connection mean that it might be possible for one twin to experience thesensations of the other twin. For instance, if Krista is watching a particularly funny television program, Tatianamight smile or laugh even if she is not watching the program. This particular possibility has piqued theinterest of many neuroscientists who seek to understand how the brain uses sensory information.These twins represent an enormous resource in the study of the brain, and since their condition is very rare, itis likely that as long as their family agrees, scientists will follow these girls very closely throughout their lives togain as much information as possible (Dominus, 2011).Over time, it has become clear that while Krista and Tatiana share some sensory experiences and motorcontrol, they remain two distinct individuals, which provides invaluable insight for researchers interested inthe mind and the brain (Egnor, 2017).In observational research, scientists are conducting a clinical or case study when they focus on one person orjust a few individuals. Indeed, some scientists spend their entire careers studying just 10\u201320 individuals. Whywould they do this? Obviously, when they focus their attention on a very small number of people, they can gain"

The richness of information that is collected in clinical or casestudies is unmatched by any other single research method. This allows the researcher to have a very deepunderstanding of the individuals and the particular phenomenon being studied.If clinical or case studies provide so much information, why are they not more frequent among researchers?As it turns out, the major benefit of this particular approach is also a weakness. As mentioned earlier, thisapproach is often used when studying individuals who are interesting to researchers because they have a rarecharacteristic. Therefore, the individuals who serve as the focus of case studies are not like most other people.If scientists ultimately want to explain all behavior, focusing attention on such a special group of people canmake it difficult to generalize any observations to the larger population as a whole. Generalizing refers to theability to apply the findings of a particular research project to larger segments of society. Again, case studiesprovide enormous amounts of information, but since the cases are so specific, the potential to apply what\u2019slearned to the average person may be very limited.Naturalistic ObservationIf you want to understand how behavior occurs, one of the best ways to gain information is to simply observethe behavior in its natural context. However, people might change their behavior in unexpected ways if theyknow they are being observed. How do researchers obtain accurate information when people tend to hide theirnatural behavior? As an example, imagine that your professor asks everyone in your class to raise their hand ifthey always wash their hands after using the restroom. Chances are that almost everyone in the classroom willraise their hand, but do you think hand washing after every trip to the restroom is really that universal?This is very similar to the phenomenon mentioned earlier in this chapter: many individuals do not feelcomfortable answering a question honestly. But if we are committed to finding out the facts about handwashing, we have other options available to us.Suppose we send a classmate into the restroom to actually watch whether everyone washes their hands afterusing the restroom. Will our observer blend into the restroom environment by wearing a white lab coat, sittingwith a clipboard, and staring at the sinks? We want our researcher to be inconspicuous\u2014perhaps standing atone of the sinks pretending to put in contact lenses while secretly recording the relevant information. Thistype of observational study is called naturalistic observation: observing behavior in its natural setting. Tobetter understand peer exclusion, Suzanne Fanger collaborated with colleagues at the University of Texas toobserve the behavior of preschool children on a playground. How did the observers remain inconspicuousover the duration of the study? They equipped a few of the children with wireless microphones (which thechildren quickly forgot about) and observed while taking notes from a distance. Also, the children in thatparticular preschool (a \u201claboratory preschool\u201d) were accustomed to having observers on the playground(Fanger, Frankel, & Hazen, 2012).It is critical that the observer be as unobtrusive and as inconspicuous as possible: when people know they arebeing watched, they are less likely to behave naturally. If you have any doubt about this, ask yourself how yourdriving behavior might differ in two situations: In the first situation, you are driving down a deserted highwayduring the middle of the day; in the second situation, you are being followed by a police car down the samedeserted highway (Figure 2.7)."

(credit: Michael Gil)It should be pointed out that naturalistic observation is not limited to research involving humans. Indeed,some of the best-known examples of naturalistic observation involve researchers going into the field toobserve various kinds of animals in their own environments. As with human studies, the researchers maintaintheir distance and avoid interfering with the animal subjects so as not to influence their natural behaviors.Scientists have used this technique to study social hierarchies and interactions among animals ranging fromground squirrels to gorillas. The information provided by these studies is invaluable in understanding howthose animals organize socially and communicate with one another. The anthropologist Jane Goodall, forexample, spent nearly five decades observing the behavior of chimpanzees in Africa (Figure 2.8). As anillustration of the types of concerns that a researcher might encounter in naturalistic observation, somescientists criticized Goodall for giving the chimps names instead of referring to them by numbers\u2014usingnames was thought to undermine the emotional detachment required for the objectivity of the study (McKie,2010).FIGURE 2.8 (a) Jane Goodall made a career of conducting naturalistic observations of (b) chimpanzee behavior.(credit \u201cJane Goodall\u201d: modification of work by Erik Hersman; \u201cchimpanzee\u201d: modification of work by \u201cAfrikaForce\u201d/Flickr.com)The greatest benefit of naturalistic observation is the validity, or accuracy, of information collectedunobtrusively in a natural setting. Having individuals behave as they normally would in a given situationmeans that we have a higher degree of ecological validity, or realism, than we might achieve with otherresearch approaches. Therefore, our ability to generalize the findings of the research to real-world situations isenhanced. If done correctly, we need not worry about people or animals modifying their behavior simplybecause they are being observed. Sometimes, people may assume that reality programs give us a glimpse intoauthentic human behavior. However, the principle of inconspicuous observation is violated as reality stars arefollowed by camera crews and are interviewed on camera for personal confessionals. Given that environment,we must doubt how natural and realistic their behaviors are.The major downside of naturalistic observation is that they are often difficult to set up and control. In ourrestroom study, what if you stood in the restroom all day prepared to record people\u2019s hand washing behaviorand no one came in? Or, what if you have been closely observing a troop of gorillas for weeks only to find thatthey migrated to a new place while you were sleeping in your tent? The benefit of realistic data comes at a cost.As a researcher you have no control of when (or if) you have behavior to observe. In addition, this type of"

In these cases, people are observed while engaging in set,specific tasks. An excellent example of structured observation comes from Strange Situation by MaryAinsworth (you will read more about this in the chapter on lifespan development). The Strange Situation is aprocedure used to evaluate attachment styles that exist between an infant and caregiver. In this scenario,caregivers bring their infants into a room filled with toys. The Strange Situation involves a number of phases,including a stranger coming into the room, the caregiver leaving the room, and the caregiver\u2019s return to theroom. The infant\u2019s behavior is closely monitored at each phase, but it is the behavior of the infant upon beingreunited with the caregiver that is most telling in terms of characterizing the infant\u2019s attachment style with thecaregiver.Another potential problem in observational research is observer bias. Generally, people who act as observersare closely involved in the research project and may unconsciously skew their observations to fit theirresearch goals or expectations. To protect against this type of bias, researchers should have clear criteriaestablished for the types of behaviors recorded and how those behaviors should be classified. In addition,researchers often compare observations of the same event by multiple observers, in order to test inter-raterreliability: a measure of reliability that assesses the consistency of observations by different observers.SurveysOften, psychologists develop surveys as a means of gathering data. Surveys are lists of questions to beanswered by research participants, and can be delivered as paper-and-pencil questionnaires, administeredelectronically, or conducted verbally (Figure 2.9). Generally, the survey itself can be completed in a short time,and the ease of administering a survey makes it easy to collect data from a large number of people.Surveys allow researchers to gather data from larger samples than may be afforded by other researchmethods. A sample is a subset of individuals selected from a population, which is the overall group ofindividuals that the researchers are interested in. Researchers study the sample and seek to generalize theirfindings to the population. Generally, researchers will begin this process by calculating various measures ofcentral tendency from the data they have collected. These measures provide an overall summary of what atypical response looks like. There are three measures of central tendency: mode, median, and mean. Themode is the most frequently occurring response, the median lies at the middle of a given data set, and themean is the arithmetic average of all data points. Means tend to be most useful in conducting additionalanalyses like those described below; however, means are very sensitive to the effects of outliers, and so onemust be aware of those effects when making assessments of what measures of central tendency tell us about adata set in question.FIGURE 2.9 Surveys can be administered in a number of ways, including electronically administered research, likethe survey shown here.

        "data": "Page 4646 2 \u2022 Psychological ResearchThere is both strength and weakness of the survey in comparison to case studies. By using surveys, we cancollect information from a larger sample of people. A larger sample is better able to reflect the actual diversityof the population, thus allowing better generalizability. Therefore, if our sample is sufficiently large anddiverse, we can assume that the data we collect from the survey can be generalized to the larger populationwith more certainty than the information collected through a case study. However, given the greater number ofpeople involved, we are not able to collect the same depth of information on each person that would becollected in a case study.Another potential weakness of surveys is something we touched on earlier in this chapter: People don't alwaysgive accurate responses. They may lie, misremember, or answer questions in a way that they think makesthem look good. For example, people may report drinking less alcohol than is actually the case.Any number of research questions can be answered through the use of surveys. One real-world example is theresearch conducted by Jenkins, Ruppel, Kizer, Yehl, and Griffin (2012) about the backlash against the US Arab-American community following the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001. Jenkins and colleagues wanted todetermine to what extent these negative attitudes toward Arab-Americans still existed nearly a decade afterthe attacks occurred. In one study, 140 research participants filled out a survey with 10 questions, includingquestions asking directly about the participant\u2019s overt prejudicial attitudes toward people of variousethnicities. The survey also asked indirect questions about how likely the participant would be to interact witha person of a given ethnicity in a variety of settings (such as, \u201cHow likely do you think it is that you wouldintroduce yourself to a person of Arab-American descent?\u201d). The results of the research suggested thatparticipants were unwilling to report prejudicial attitudes toward any ethnic group. However, there weresignificant differences between their pattern of responses to questions about social interaction with Arab-Americans compared to other ethnic groups: they indicated less willingness for social interaction with Arab-Americans compared to the other ethnic groups. This suggested that the participants harbored subtle forms ofprejudice against Arab-Americans, despite their assertions that this was not the case (Jenkins et al., 2012).Archival ResearchSome researchers gain access to large amounts of data without interacting with a single research participant.Instead, they use existing records to answer various research questions. This type of research approach isknown as archival research. Archival research relies on looking at past records or data sets to look forinteresting patterns or relationships.For example, a researcher might access the academic records of all individuals who enrolled in college withinthe past ten years and calculate how long it took them to complete their degrees, as well as course loads,grades, and extracurricular involvement. Archival research could provide important information about who ismost likely to complete their education, and it could help identify important risk factors for strugglingstudents (Figure 2.10).FIGURE 2.10 A researcher doing archival research examines records, whether archived as a (a) hardcopy or (b)electronically.

        "data": "Page 472.2 \u2022 Approaches to Research 47In comparing archival research to other research methods, there are several important distinctions. For one,the researcher employing archival research never directly interacts with research participants. Therefore, theinvestment of time and money to collect data is considerably less with archival research. Additionally,researchers have no control over what information was originally collected. Therefore, research questionshave to be tailored so they can be answered within the structure of the existing data sets. There is also noguarantee of consistency between the records from one source to another, which might make comparing andcontrasting different data sets problematic.Longitudinal and Cross-Sectional ResearchSometimes we want to see how people change over time, as in studies of human development and lifespan.When we test the same group of individuals repeatedly over an extended period of time, we are conductinglongitudinal research. Longitudinal research is a research design in which data-gathering is administeredrepeatedly over an extended period of time. For example, we may survey a group of individuals about theirdietary habits at age 20, retest them a decade later at age 30, and then again at age 40.Another approach is cross-sectional research. In cross-sectional research, a researcher compares multiplesegments of the population at the same time. Using the dietary habits example above, the researcher mightdirectly compare different groups of people by age. Instead of studying a group of people for 20 years to seehow their dietary habits changed from decade to decade, the researcher would study a group of 20-year-oldindividuals and compare them to a group of 30-year-old individuals and a group of 40-year-old individuals.While cross-sectional research requires a shorter-term investment, it is also limited by differences that existbetween the different generations (or cohorts) that have nothing to do with age per se, but rather reflect thesocial and cultural experiences of different generations of individuals make them different from one another.To illustrate this concept, consider the following survey findings. In recent years there has been significantgrowth in the popular support of same-sex marriage. Many studies on this topic break down surveyparticipants into different age groups. In general, younger people are more supportive of same-sex marriagethan are those who are older (Jones, 2013). Does this mean that as we age we become less open to the idea ofsame-sex marriage, or does this mean that older individuals have different perspectives because of the socialclimates in which they grew up? Longitudinal research is a powerful approach because the same individualsare involved in the research project over time, which means that the researchers need to be less concernedwith differences among cohorts affecting the results of their study.Often longitudinal studies are employed when researching various diseases in an effort to understandparticular risk factors. Such studies often involve tens of thousands of individuals who are followed for severaldecades. Given the enormous number of people involved in these studies, researchers can feel confident thattheir findings can be generalized to the larger population. The Cancer Prevention Study-3 (CPS-3) is one of aseries of longitudinal studies sponsored by the American Cancer Society aimed at determining predictive riskfactors associated with cancer. When participants enter the study, they complete a survey about their lives andfamily histories, providing information on factors that might cause or prevent the development of cancer. Thenevery few years the participants receive additional surveys to complete. In the end, hundreds of thousands ofparticipants will be tracked over 20 years to determine which of them develop cancer and which do not.Clearly, this type of research is important and potentially very informative. For instance, earlier longitudinalstudies sponsored by the American Cancer Society provided some of the first scientific demonstrations of thenow well-established links between increased rates of cancer and smoking (American Cancer Society, n.d.)(Figure 2.11)."

(credit: CDC/Debora Cartagena)As with any research strategy, longitudinal research is not without limitations. For one, these studies requirean incredible time investment by the researcher and research participants. Given that some longitudinalstudies take years, if not decades, to complete, the results will not be known for a considerable period of time.In addition to the time demands, these studies also require a substantial financial investment. Manyresearchers are unable to commit the resources necessary to see a longitudinal project through to the end.Research participants must also be willing to continue their participation for an extended period of time, andthis can be problematic. People move, get married and take new names, get ill, and eventually die. Evenwithout significant life changes, some people may simply choose to discontinue their participation in theproject. As a result, the attrition rates, or reduction in the number of research participants due to dropouts, inlongitudinal studies are quite high and increases over the course of a project. For this reason, researchersusing this approach typically recruit many participants fully expecting that a substantial number will drop outbefore the end. As the study progresses, they continually check whether the sample still represents the largerpopulation, and make adjustments as necessary."

We can measure correlation bycalculating a statistic known as a correlation coefficient. A correlation coefficient is a number from -1 to +1that indicates the strength and direction of the relationship between variables. The correlation coefficient isusually represented by the letter r.The number portion of the correlation coefficient indicates the strength of the relationship. The closer thenumber is to 1 (be it negative or positive), the more strongly related the variables are, and the more predictablechanges in one variable will be as the other variable changes. The closer the number is to zero, the weaker therelationship, and the less predictable the relationships between the variables becomes. For instance, acorrelation coefficient of 0.9 indicates a far stronger relationship than a correlation coefficient of 0.3. If thevariables are not related to one another at all, the correlation coefficient is 0. The example above about icecream and crime is an example of two variables that we might expect to have no relationship to each other.The sign\u2014positive or negative\u2014of the correlation coefficient indicates the direction of the relationship (Figure2.12). A positive correlation means that the variables move in the same direction. Put another way, it meansthat as one variable increases so does the other, and conversely, when one variable decreases so does the other.A negative correlation means that the variables move in opposite directions. If two variables are negativelycorrelated, a decrease in one variable is associated with an increase in the other and vice versa.The example of ice cream and crime rates is a positive correlation because both variables increase whentemperatures are warmer. Other examples of positive correlations are the relationship between an individual\u2019sheight and weight or the relationship between a person\u2019s age and number of wrinkles. One might expect anegative correlation to exist between someone\u2019s tiredness during the day and the number of hours they sleptthe previous night: the amount of sleep decreases as the feelings of tiredness increase. In a real-world exampleof negative correlation, student researchers at the University of Minnesota found a weak negative correlation (r= -0.29) between the average number of days per week that students got fewer than 5 hours of sleep and theirGPA (Lowry, Dean, & Manders, 2010). Keep in mind that a negative correlation is not the same as nocorrelation. For example, we would probably find no correlation between hours of sleep and shoe size.As mentioned earlier, correlations have predictive value. Imagine that you are on the admissions committee ofa major university. You are faced with a huge number of applications, but you are able to accommodate only asmall percentage of the applicant pool. How might you decide who should be admitted? You might try tocorrelate your current students\u2019 college GPA with their scores on standardized tests like the SAT or ACT. Byobserving which correlations were strongest for your current students, you could use this information topredict relative success of those students who have applied for admission into the university.FIGURE 2.12 Scatterplots are a graphical view of the strength and direction of correlations. The stronger thecorrelation, the closer the data points are to a straight line. In these examples, we see that there is (a) a positivecorrelation between weight and height, (b) a negative correlation between tiredness and hours of sleep, and (c) nocorrelation between shoe size and hours of sleep."

However, correlation is limited because establishing the existence of arelationship tells us little about cause and effect. While variables are sometimes correlated because one doescause the other, it could also be that some other factor, a confounding variable, is actually causing thesystematic movement in our variables of interest. In the ice cream/crime rate example mentioned earlier,temperature is a confounding variable that could account for the relationship between the two variables.Even when we cannot point to clear confounding variables, we should not assume that a correlation betweentwo variables implies that one variable causes changes in another. This can be frustrating when a cause-and-effect relationship seems clear and intuitive. Think back to our discussion of the research done by theAmerican Cancer Society and how their research projects were some of the first demonstrations of the linkbetween smoking and cancer. It seems reasonable to assume that smoking causes cancer, but if we werelimited to correlational research, we would be overstepping our bounds by making this assumption.Unfortunately, people mistakenly make claims of causation as a function of correlations all the time. Suchclaims are especially common in advertisements and news stories. For example, recent research found thatpeople who eat cereal on a regular basis achieve healthier weights than those who rarely eat cereal (Frantzen,Trevi\u00f1o, Echon, Garcia-Dominic, & DiMarco, 2013; Barton et al., 2005). Guess how the cereal companies reportthis finding. Does eating cereal really cause an individual to maintain a healthy weight, or are there otherpossible explanations, such as, someone at a healthy weight is more likely to regularly eat a healthy breakfastthan someone who is obese or someone who avoids meals in an attempt to diet (Figure 2.13)? Whilecorrelational research is invaluable in identifying relationships among variables, a major limitation is theinability to establish causality. Psychologists want to make statements about cause and effect, but the only wayto do that is to conduct an experiment to answer a research question. The next section describes how scientificexperiments incorporate methods that eliminate, or control for, alternative explanations, which allowresearchers to explore how changes in one variable cause changes in another variable.FIGURE 2.13 Does eating cereal really cause someone to be a healthy weight? (credit: Tim Skillern)Illusory CorrelationsThe temptation to make erroneous cause-and-effect statements based on correlational research is not the onlyway we tend to misinterpret data. We also tend to make the mistake of illusory correlations, especially withunsystematic observations. Illusory correlations, or false correlations, occur when people believe thatrelationships exist between two things when no such relationship exists. One well-known illusory correlationis the supposed effect that the moon\u2019s phases have on human behavior. Many people passionately assert thathuman behavior is affected by the phase of the moon, and specifically, that people act strangely when the"

(credit: Cory Zanker)There is no denying that the moon exerts a powerful influence on our planet. The ebb and flow of the ocean\u2019stides are tightly tied to the gravitational forces of the moon. Many people believe, therefore, that it is logicalthat we are affected by the moon as well. After all, our bodies are largely made up of water. A meta-analysis ofnearly 40 studies consistently demonstrated, however, that the relationship between the moon and ourbehavior does not exist (Rotton & Kelly, 1985). While we may pay more attention to odd behavior during the fullphase of the moon, the rates of odd behavior remain constant throughout the lunar cycle.Why are we so apt to believe in illusory correlations like this? Often we read or hear about them and simplyaccept the information as valid. Or, we have a hunch about how something works and then look for evidence tosupport that hunch, ignoring evidence that would tell us our hunch is false; this is known as confirmationbias. Other times, we find illusory correlations based on the information that comes most easily to mind, evenif that information is severely limited. And while we may feel confident that we can use these relationships tobetter understand and predict the world around us, illusory correlations can have significant drawbacks. Forexample, research suggests that illusory correlations\u2014in which certain behaviors are inaccurately attributed tocertain groups\u2014are involved in the formation of prejudicial attitudes that can ultimately lead to discriminatorybehavior (Fiedler, 2004).Causality: Conducting Experiments and Using the DataAs you\u2019ve learned, the only way to establish that there is a cause-and-effect relationship between two variablesis to conduct a scientific experiment. Experiment has a different meaning in the scientific context than ineveryday life. In everyday conversation, we often use it to describe trying something for the first time, such asexperimenting with a new hair style or a new food. However, in the scientific context, an experiment hasprecise requirements for design and implementation.The Experimental HypothesisIn order to conduct an experiment, a researcher must have a specific hypothesis to be tested. As you\u2019velearned, hypotheses can be formulated either through direct observation of the real world or after carefulreview of previous research. For example, if you think that the use of technology in the classroom has negativeimpacts on learning, then you have basically formulated a hypothesis\u2014namely, that the use of technology inthe classroom should be limited because it decreases learning. How might you have arrived at this particularhypothesis? You may have noticed that your classmates who take notes on their laptops perform at lower levelson class exams than those who take notes by hand, or those who receive a lesson via a computer programversus via an in-person teacher have different levels of performance when tested (Figure 2.15)."

(credit: modification of work byNikolay Georgiev/Pixabay)These sorts of personal observations are what often lead us to formulate a specific hypothesis, but we cannotuse limited personal observations and anecdotal evidence to rigorously test our hypothesis. Instead, to find outif real-world data supports our hypothesis, we have to conduct an experiment.Designing an ExperimentThe most basic experimental design involves two groups: the experimental group and the control group. Thetwo groups are designed to be the same except for one difference\u2014 experimental manipulation. Theexperimental group gets the experimental manipulation\u2014that is, the treatment or variable being tested (inthis case, the use of technology)\u2014and the control group does not. Since experimental manipulation is the onlydifference between the experimental and control groups, we can be sure that any differences between the twoare due to experimental manipulation rather than chance.In our example of how the use of technology should be limited in the classroom, we have the experimentalgroup learn algebra using a computer program and then test their learning. We measure the learning in ourcontrol group after they are taught algebra by a teacher in a traditional classroom. It is important for thecontrol group to be treated similarly to the experimental group, with the exception that the control group doesnot receive the experimental manipulation.We also need to precisely define, or operationalize, how we measure learning of algebra. An operationaldefinition is a precise description of our variables, and it is important in allowing others to understand exactlyhow and what a researcher measures in a particular experiment. In operationalizing learning, we mightchoose to look at performance on a test covering the material on which the individuals were taught by theteacher or the computer program. We might also ask our participants to summarize the information that wasjust presented in some way. Whatever we determine, it is important that we operationalize learning in such away that anyone who hears about our study for the first time knows exactly what we mean by learning. Thisaids peoples\u2019 ability to interpret our data as well as their capacity to repeat our experiment should they chooseto do so.Once we have operationalized what is considered use of technology and what is considered learning in ourexperiment participants, we need to establish how we will run our experiment. In this case, we might haveparticipants spend 45 minutes learning algebra (either through a computer program or with an in-personmath teacher) and then give them a test on the material covered during the 45 minutes."

Experimenter bias refers to the possibility that a researcher\u2019sexpectations might skew the results of the study. Remember, conducting an experiment requires a lot ofplanning, and the people involved in the research project have a vested interest in supporting theirhypotheses. If the observers knew which child was in which group, it might influence how they interpretambiguous responses, such as sloppy handwriting or minor computational mistakes. By being blind to whichchild is in which group, we protect against those biases. This situation is a single-blind study, meaning thatone of the groups (participants) are unaware as to which group they are in (experiment or control group) whilethe researcher who developed the experiment knows which participants are in each group.In a double-blind study, both the researchers and the participants are blind to group assignments. Why woulda researcher want to run a study where no one knows who is in which group? Because by doing so, we cancontrol for both experimenter and participant expectations. If you are familiar with the phrase placebo effect,you already have some idea as to why this is an important consideration. The placebo effect occurs whenpeople's expectations or beliefs influence or determine their experience in a given situation. In other words,simply expecting something to happen can actually make it happen.The placebo effect is commonly described in terms of testing the effectiveness of a new medication. Imaginethat you work in a pharmaceutical company, and you think you have a new drug that is effective in treatingdepression. To demonstrate that your medication is effective, you run an experiment with two groups: Theexperimental group receives the medication, and the control group does not. But you don\u2019t want participantsto know whether they received the drug or not.Why is that? Imagine that you are a participant in this study, and you have just taken a pill that you think willimprove your mood. Because you expect the pill to have an effect, you might feel better simply because youtook the pill and not because of any drug actually contained in the pill\u2014this is the placebo effect.To make sure that any effects on mood are due to the drug and not due to expectations, the control groupreceives a placebo (in this case a sugar pill). Now everyone gets a pill, and once again neither the researchernor the experimental participants know who got the drug and who got the sugar pill. Any differences in moodbetween the experimental and control groups can now be attributed to the drug itself rather than toexperimenter bias or participant expectations (Figure 2.16).FIGURE 2.16 Providing the control group with a placebo treatment protects against bias caused by expectancy.(credit: Elaine and Arthur Shapiro)Independent and Dependent VariablesIn a research experiment, we strive to study whether changes in one thing cause changes in another.

An independent variable ismanipulated or controlled by the experimenter. In a well-designed experimental study, the independentvariable is the only important difference between the experimental and control groups. In our example of howtechnology use in the classroom affects learning, the independent variable is the type of learning byparticipants in the study (Figure 2.17). A dependent variable is what the researcher measures to see howmuch effect the independent variable had. In our example, the dependent variable is the learning exhibited byour participants.FIGURE 2.17 In an experiment, manipulations of the independent variable are expected to result in changes in thedependent variable. (credit: \u201cclassroom\u201d modification of work by Nikolay Georgiev/Pixabay; credit \u201cnote taking\u201d:modification of work by KF/Wikimedia)We expect that the dependent variable will change as a function of the independent variable. In other words,the dependent variable dependson the independent variable. A good way to think about the relationshipbetween the independent and dependent variables is with this question: What effect does the independentvariable have on the dependent variable? Returning to our example, what is the effect of being taught a lessonthrough a computer program versus through an in-person instructor?Selecting and Assigning Experimental ParticipantsNow that our study is designed, we need to obtain a sample of individuals to include in our experiment. Ourstudy involves human participants so we need to determine who to include. Participants are the subjects ofpsychological research, and as the name implies, individuals who are involved in psychological researchactively participate in the process. Often, psychological research projects rely on college students to serve asparticipants. In fact, the vast majority of research in psychology subfields has historically involved students asresearch participants (Sears, 1986; Arnett, 2008). But are college students truly representative of the generalpopulation? College students tend to be younger, more educated, more liberal, and less diverse than thegeneral population. Although using students as test subjects is an accepted practice, relying on such a limitedpool of research participants can be problematic because it is difficult to generalize findings to the largerpopulation.Our hypothetical experiment involves high school students, and we must first generate a sample of students.Samples are used because populations are usually too large to reasonably involve every member in ourparticular experiment (Figure 2.18). If possible, we should use a random sample (there are other types of"

A random sample is a subsetof a larger population in which every member of the population has an equal chance of being selected.Random samples are preferred because if the sample is large enough we can be reasonably sure that theparticipating individuals are representative of the larger population. This means that the percentages ofcharacteristics in the sample\u2014sex, ethnicity, socioeconomic level, and any other characteristics that mightaffect the results\u2014are close to those percentages in the larger population.In our example, let\u2019s say we decide our population of interest is algebra students. But all algebra students is avery large population, so we need to be more specific; instead we might say our population of interest is allalgebra students in a particular city. We should include students from various income brackets, familysituations, races, ethnicities, religions, and geographic areas of town. With this more manageable population,we can work with the local schools in selecting a random sample of around 200 algebra students who we wantto participate in our experiment.In summary, because we cannot test all of the algebra students in a city, we want to find a group of about 200that reflects the composition of that city. With a representative group, we can generalize our findings to thelarger population without fear of our sample being biased in some way.FIGURE 2.18 Researchers may work with (a) a large population or (b) a sample group that is a subset of the largerpopulation. (credit \u201ccrowd\u201d: modification of work by James Cridland; credit \u201cstudents\u201d: modification of work byLaurie Sullivan)Now that we have a sample, the next step of the experimental process is to split the participants intoexperimental and control groups through random assignment. With random assignment, all participantshave an equal chance of being assigned to either group. There is statistical software that will randomly assigneach of the algebra students in the sample to either the experimental or the control group.Random assignment is critical for sound experimental design. With sufficiently large samples, randomassignment makes it unlikely that there are systematic differences between the groups. So, for instance, itwould be very unlikely that we would get one group composed entirely of males, a given ethnic identity, or agiven religious ideology. This is important because if the groups were systematically different before theexperiment began, we would not know the origin of any differences we find between the groups: Were thedifferences preexisting, or were they caused by manipulation of the independent variable? Randomassignment allows us to assume that any differences observed between experimental and control groupsresult from the manipulation of the independent variable.LINK TO LEARNINGUse this online random number generator (http://openstax.org/l/rannumbers) to learn more about randomsampling and assignments.Issues to ConsiderWhile experiments allow scientists to make cause-and-effect claims, they are not without problems.

        "data": "Page 5656 2 \u2022 Psychological Researchexperiments require the experimenter to manipulate an independent variable, and that can complicate manyquestions that psychologists might want to address. For instance, imagine that you want to know what effectsex (the independent variable) has on spatial memory (the dependent variable). Although you can certainlylook for differences between males and females on a task that taps into spatial memory, you cannot directlycontrol a person\u2019s sex. We categorize this type of research approach as quasi-experimental and recognize thatwe cannot make cause-and-effect claims in these circumstances.Experimenters are also limited by ethical constraints. For instance, you would not be able to conduct anexperiment designed to determine if experiencing abuse as a child leads to lower levels of self-esteem amongadults. To conduct such an experiment, you would need to randomly assign some experimental participants toa group that receives abuse, and that experiment would be unethical.Interpreting Experimental FindingsOnce data is collected from both the experimental and the control groups, a statistical analysis is conducted tofind out if there are meaningful differences between the two groups. A statistical analysis determines howlikely any difference found is due to chance (and thus not meaningful). For example, if an experiment is doneon the effectiveness of a nutritional supplement, and those taking a placebo pill (and not the supplement) havethe same result as those taking the supplement, then the experiment has shown that the nutritionalsupplement is not effective. Generally, psychologists consider differences to be statistically significant if thereis less than a five percent chance of observing them if the groups did not actually differ from one another.Stated another way, psychologists want to limit the chances of making \u201cfalse positive\u201d claims to five percent orless.The greatest strength of experiments is the ability to assert that any significant differences in the findings arecaused by the independent variable. This occurs because random selection, random assignment, and a designthat limits the effects of both experimenter bias and participant expectancy should create groups that aresimilar in composition and treatment. Therefore, any difference between the groups is attributable to theindependent variable, and now we can finally make a causal statement. If we find that watching a violenttelevision program results in more violent behavior than watching a nonviolent program, we can safely saythat watching violent television programs causes an increase in the display of violent behavior.Reporting ResearchWhen psychologists complete a research project, they generally want to share their findings with otherscientists. The American Psychological Association (APA) publishes a manual detailing how to write a paper forsubmission to scientific journals. Unlike an article that might be published in a magazine like PsychologyToday,which targets a general audience with an interest in psychology, scientific journals generally publishpeer-reviewed journal articles aimed at an audience of professionals and scholars who are actively involvedin research themselves.LINK TO LEARNINGThe Online Writing Lab (OWL) (http://openstax.org/l/owl) at Purdue University can walk you through the APAwriting guidelines.A peer-reviewed journal article is read by several other scientists (generally anonymously) with expertise inthe subject matter. These peer reviewers provide feedback\u2014to both the author and the journaleditor\u2014regarding the quality of the draft. Peer reviewers look for a strong rationale for the research beingdescribed, a clear description of how the research was conducted, and evidence that the research wasconducted in an ethical manner.

This helps prevent unnecessary duplication of research findings in the scientificliterature and, to some extent, ensures that each research article provides new information. Ultimately, thejournal editor will compile all of the peer reviewer feedback and determine whether the article will bepublished in its current state (a rare occurrence), published with revisions, or not accepted for publication.Peer review provides some degree of quality control for psychological research. Poorly conceived or executedstudies can be weeded out, and even well-designed research can be improved by the revisions suggested. Peerreview also ensures that the research is described clearly enough to allow other scientists to replicate it,meaning they can repeat the experiment using different samples to determine reliability. Sometimesreplications involve additional measures that expand on the original finding. In any case, each replicationserves to provide more evidence to support the original research findings. Successful replications of publishedresearch make scientists more apt to adopt those findings, while repeated failures tend to cast doubt on thelegitimacy of the original article and lead scientists to look elsewhere. For example, it would be a majoradvancement in the medical field if a published study indicated that taking a new drug helped individualsachieve a healthy weight without changing their diet. But if other scientists could not replicate the results, theoriginal study\u2019s claims would be questioned.In recent years, there has been increasing concern about a \u201creplication crisis\u201d that has affected a number ofscientific fields, including psychology. Some of the most well-known studies and scientists have producedresearch that has failed to be replicated by others (as discussed in Shrout & Rodgers, 2018). In fact, even afamous Nobel Prize-winning scientist has recently retracted a published paper because she had difficultyreplicating her results (Nobel Prize-winning scientist Frances Arnold retracts paper, 2020 January 3). Thesekinds of outcomes have prompted some scientists to begin to work together and more openly, and some wouldargue that the current \u201ccrisis\u201d is actually improving the ways in which science is conducted and in how itsresults are shared with others (Aschwanden, 2018).DIG DEEPERThe Vaccine-Autism Myth and Retraction of Published StudiesSome scientists have claimed that routine childhood vaccines cause some children to develop autism, and, infact, several peer-reviewed publications published research making these claims. Since the initial reports, large-scale epidemiological research has indicated that vaccinations are not responsible for causing autism and that itis much safer to have your child vaccinated than not. Furthermore, several of the original studies making thisclaim have since been retracted.A published piece of work can be rescinded when data is called into question because of falsification, fabrication,or serious research design problems. Once rescinded, the scientific community is informed that there are seriousproblems with the original publication. Retractions can be initiated by the researcher who led the study, byresearch collaborators, by the institution that employed the researcher, or by the editorial board of the journal inwhich the article was originally published. In the vaccine-autism case, the retraction was made because of asignificant conflict of interest in which the leading researcher had a financial interest in establishing a linkbetween childhood vaccines and autism (Offit, 2008). Unfortunately, the initial studies received so much mediaattention that many parents around the world became hesitant to have their children vaccinated (Figure 2.19).Continued reliance on such debunked studies has significant consequences. For instance, between January andOctober of 2019, there were 22 measles outbreaks across the United States and more than a thousand cases ofindividuals contracting measles (Patel et al., 2019). This is likely due to the anti-vaccination movements thathave risen from the debunked research. For more information about how the vaccine/autism story unfolded, aswell as the repercussions of this story, take a look at Paul Offit\u2019s book, Autism\u2019s False Prophets: Bad Science,Risky Medicine, and the Search for a Cure."

(credit: modification of work by UNICEFSverige)Reliability and ValidityReliability and validity are two important considerations that must be made with any type of data collection.Reliability refers to the ability to consistently produce a given result. In the context of psychological research,this would mean that any instruments or tools used to collect data do so in consistent, reproducible ways.There are a number of different types of reliability. Some of these include inter-rater reliability (the degree towhich two or more different observers agree on what has been observed), internal consistency (the degree towhich different items on a survey that measure the same thing correlate with one another), and test-retestreliability (the degree to which the outcomes of a particular measure remain consistent over multipleadministrations).Unfortunately, being consistent in measurement does not necessarily mean that you have measuredsomething correctly. To illustrate this concept, consider a kitchen scale that would be used to measure theweight of cereal that you eat in the morning. If the scale is not properly calibrated, it may consistently under-or overestimate the amount of cereal that\u2019s being measured. While the scale is highly reliable in producingconsistent results (e.g., the same amount of cereal poured onto the scale produces the same reading eachtime), those results are incorrect. This is where validity comes into play. Validity refers to the extent to which agiven instrument or tool accurately measures what it\u2019s supposed to measure, and once again, there are anumber of ways in which validity can be expressed. Ecological validity (the degree to which research resultsgeneralize to real-world applications), construct validity (the degree to which a given variable actually capturesor measures what it is intended to measure), and face validity (the degree to which a given variable seems validon the surface) are just a few types that researchers consider. While any valid measure is by necessity reliable,the reverse is not necessarily true. Researchers strive to use instruments that are both highly reliable andvalid."

Research conducted by the College Board suggests thatscores on the SAT have high predictive validity for first-year college students\u2019 GPA (Kobrin, Patterson, Shaw,Mattern, & Barbuti, 2008). In this context, predictive validity refers to the test\u2019s ability to effectively predict theGPA of college freshmen. Given that many institutions of higher education require the SAT or ACT for admission,this high degree of predictive validity might be comforting.However, the emphasis placed on SAT or ACT scores in college admissions is changing based on a number offactors. For one, some researchers assert that these tests are biased, and students from historically marginalizedpopulations are at a disadvantage that unfairly reduces the likelihood of being admitted into a college (Santelices& Wilson, 2010). Additionally, some research has suggested that the predictive validity of these tests is grosslyexaggerated in how well they are able to predict the GPA of first-year college students. In fact, it has beensuggested that the SAT\u2019s predictive validity may be overestimated by as much as 150% (Rothstein, 2004). Manyinstitutions of higher education are beginning to consider de-emphasizing the significance of SAT scores inmaking admission decisions (Rimer, 2008).Recent examples of high profile cheating scandals both domestically and abroad have only increased the scrutinybeing placed on these types of tests, and as of March 2019, more than 1000 institutions of higher education haveeither relaxed or eliminated the requirements for SAT or ACT testing for admissions (Strauss, 2019, March 19)."

For one, each participantmust sign an informed consent form before they can participate in the experiment. An informed consent formprovides a written description of what participants can expect during the experiment, including potential risksand implications of the research. It also lets participants know that their involvement is completely voluntaryand can be discontinued without penalty at any time. Furthermore, the informed consent guarantees that anydata collected in the experiment will remain completely confidential. In cases where research participants areunder the age of 18, the parents or legal guardians are required to sign the informed consent form.LINK TO LEARNINGView this example of a consent form (http://openstax.org/l/consentform) to learn more.While the informed consent form should be as honest as possible in describing exactly what participants willbe doing, sometimes deception is necessary to prevent participants\u2019 knowledge of the exact research questionfrom affecting the results of the study. Deception involves purposely misleading experiment participants inorder to maintain the integrity of the experiment, but not to the point where the deception could be consideredharmful. For example, if we are interested in how our opinion of someone is affected by their attire, we mightuse deception in describing the experiment to prevent that knowledge from affecting participants\u2019 responses.In cases where deception is involved, participants must receive a full debriefing upon conclusion of thestudy\u2014complete, honest information about the purpose of the experiment, how the data collected will be used,the reasons why deception was necessary, and information about how to obtain additional information aboutthe study.DIG DEEPEREthics and the Tuskegee Syphilis StudyUnfortunately, the ethical guidelines that exist for research today were not always applied in the past. In 1932,rural, Black men from Tuskegee, Alabama, were recruited to participate in an experiment conducted by the U.S.Public Health Service, with the aim of studying syphilis in Black men (Figure 2.21). In exchange for free medicalcare, meals, and burial insurance, 600 men agreed to participate in the study.

However, those individuals that tested positive for syphilis were neverinformed that they had the disease.While there was no treatment for syphilis when the study began, by 1947 penicillin was recognized as aneffective treatment for the disease. Despite this, no penicillin was administered to the participants in this study,and the participants were not allowed to seek treatment at any other facilities if they continued in the study. Overthe course of 40 years, many of the participants unknowingly spread syphilis to their wives (and subsequentlytheir children born from their wives) and eventually died because they never received treatment for the disease.This study was discontinued in 1972 when the experiment was discovered by the national press (TuskegeeUniversity, n.d.).

The correlationcoefficient tells us about the nature (positive or negative) and the strength of the relationship between two ormore variables. Correlations do not tell us anything about causation\u2014regardless of how strong the relationshipis between variables. In fact, the only way to demonstrate causation is by conducting an experiment. Peopleoften make the mistake of claiming that correlations exist when they really do not.Researchers can test cause-and-effect hypotheses by conducting experiments. Ideally, experimentalparticipants are randomly selected from the population of interest. Then, the participants are randomlyassigned to their respective groups. Sometimes, the researcher and the participants are blind to groupmembership to prevent their expectations from influencing the results.In ideal experimental design, the only difference between the experimental and control groups is whetherparticipants are exposed to the experimental manipulation. Each group goes through all phases of theexperiment, but each group will experience a different level of the independent variable: the experimentalgroup is exposed to the experimental manipulation, and the control group is not exposed to the experimentalmanipulation. The researcher then measures the changes that are produced in the dependent variable in eachgroup. Once data is collected from both groups, it is analyzed statistically to determine if there are meaningfuldifferences between the groups.Psychologists report their research findings in peer-reviewed journal articles. Research published in thisformat is checked by several other psychologists who serve as a filter separating ideas that are supported byevidence from ideas that are not. Replication has an important role in ensuring the legitimacy of publishedresearch. In the long run, only those findings that are capable of being replicated consistently will achieveconsensus in the scientific community."

While all humans share certain biological mechanisms, we are each unique. And while ourbodies have many of the same parts\u2014brains and hormones and cells with genetic codes\u2014these are expressedin a wide variety of behaviors, thoughts, and reactions.Why do two people infected by the same disease have different outcomes: one surviving and one succumbingto the ailment? How are genetic diseases passed through family lines? Are there genetic components topsychological disorders, such as depression or schizophrenia? To what extent might there be a psychologicalbasis to health conditions such as childhood obesity?To explore these questions, let\u2019s start by focusing on a specific genetic disorder, sickle cell anemia, and how itmight manifest in two affected sisters. Sickle-cell anemia is a genetic condition in which red blood cells, whichare normally round, take on a crescent-like shape (Figure 3.2). The changed shape of these cells affects howthey function: sickle-shaped cells can clog blood vessels and block blood flow, leading to high fever, severepain, swelling, and tissue damage.FIGURE 3.2 Normal blood cells travel freely through the blood vessels, while sickle-shaped cells form blockagespreventing blood flow.Many people with sickle-cell anemia\u2014and the particular genetic mutation that causes it\u2014die at an early age.While the notion of \u201csurvival of the fittest\u201d may suggest that people with this disorder have a low survival rateand therefore the disorder will become less common, this is not the case. Despite the negative evolutionaryeffects associated with this genetic mutation, the sickle-cell gene remains relatively common among people ofAfrican descent. Why is this? The explanation is illustrated with the following scenario.Imagine two young women\u2014Luwi and Sena\u2014sisters in rural Zambia, Africa. Luwi carries the gene for sickle-cell anemia; Sena does not carry the gene. Sickle-cell carriers have one copy of the sickle-cell gene but do nothave full-blown sickle-cell anemia. They experience symptoms only if they are severely dehydrated or aredeprived of oxygen (as in mountain climbing). Carriers are thought to be immune from malaria (an oftendeadly disease that is widespread in tropical climates) because changes in their blood chemistry and immunefunctioning prevent the malaria parasite from having its effects (Gong, Parikh, Rosenthal, & Greenhouse,2013). However, full-blown sickle-cell anemia, with two copies of the sickle-cell gene, does not provideimmunity to malaria."

Luwi isprotected against malaria because she carries the sickle-cell mutation. Sena, on the other hand, developsmalaria and dies just two weeks later. Luwi survives and eventually has children, to whom she may pass on thesickle-cell mutation.LINK TO LEARNINGVisit this website about how a mutation in DNA leads to sickle cell anemia (http://openstax.org/l/sickle1) tolearn more.Malaria is rare in the United States, so the sickle-cell gene benefits nobody: the gene manifests primarily inminor health problems for carriers with one copy, or a severe full-blown disease with no health benefits forcarriers with two copies. However, the situation is quite different in other parts of the world. In parts of Africawhere malaria is prevalent, having the sickle-cell mutation does provide health benefits for carriers(protection from malaria).The story of malaria fits with Charles Darwin's theory of evolution by natural selection (Figure 3.3). In simpleterms, the theory states that organisms that are better suited for their environment will survive and reproduce,while those that are poorly suited for their environment will die off. In our example, we can see that, as acarrier, Luwi\u2019s mutation is highly adaptive in her African homeland; however, if she resided in the UnitedStates (where malaria is rare), her mutation could prove costly\u2014with a high probability of the disease in herdescendants and minor health problems of her own.FIGURE 3.3 (a) In 1859, Charles Darwin proposed his theory of evolution by natural selection in his book, On theOrigin of Species. (b) The book contains just one illustration: this diagram that shows how species evolve over timethrough natural selection.DIG DEEPERTwo Perspectives on Genetics and BehaviorIt\u2019s easy to get confused about two fields that study the interaction of genes and the environment, such as thefields of evolutionary psychology and behavioral genetics. How can we tell them apart?In both fields, it is understood that genes not only code for particular traits, but also contribute to certainpatterns of cognition and behavior. Evolutionary psychology focuses on how universal patterns of behavior andcognitive processes have evolved over time. Therefore, variations in cognition and behavior would makeindividuals more or less successful in reproducing and passing those genes on to their offspring. Evolutionarypsychologists study a variety of psychological phenomena that may have evolved as adaptations, including fear"

When studying human behavior, behavioral geneticists often employ twin and adoption studies toresearch questions of interest. Twin studies compare the likelihood that a given behavioral trait is shared amongidentical and fraternal twins; adoption studies compare those rates among biologically related relatives andadopted relatives. Both approaches provide some insight into the relative importance of genes and environmentfor the expression of a given trait.LINK TO LEARNINGWatch this interview with renowned evolutionary psychologist David Buss (http://openstax.org/l/buss) to learnmore about how a psychologist approaches evolution and how this approach fits within the social sciences.Genetic VariationGenetic variation, the genetic difference between individuals, is what contributes to a species\u2019 adaptation to itsenvironment. In humans, genetic variation begins with an egg, about 100 million sperm, and fertilization.Roughly once per month, active ovaries release an egg from follicles. During the egg's journey from the ovarythrough the fallopian tubes, to the uterus, a sperm may fertilize the egg.The egg and the sperm each contain 23 chromosomes. Chromosomes are long strings of genetic materialknown as deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA). DNA is a helix-shaped molecule made up of nucleotide base pairs. Ineach chromosome, sequences of DNA make up genes that control or partially control a number of visiblecharacteristics, known as traits, such as eye color, hair color, and so on. A single gene may have multiplepossible variations, or alleles. An allele is a specific version of a gene. So, a given gene may code for the trait ofhair color, and the different alleles of that gene affect which hair color an individual has.When a sperm and egg fuse, their 23 chromosomes combine to create a zygote with 46 chromosomes (23pairs). Therefore, each parent contributes half the genetic information carried by the offspring; the resultingphysical characteristics of the offspring (called the phenotype) are determined by the interaction of geneticmaterial supplied by the sperm and egg (called the genotype). A person\u2019s genotype is the genetic makeup ofthat individual. Phenotype, on the other hand, refers to the individual\u2019s inherited physical characteristics,which are a combination of genetic and environmental influences (Figure 3.4).FIGURE 3.4 (a) Genotype refers to the genetic makeup of an individual based on the genetic material (DNA)inherited from one\u2019s genetic contributors.

The concept of agenetic parent is distinct from social and legal concepts of parenthood, and may differ from those whompeople consider their parents.Most traits are controlled by multiple genes, but some traits are controlled by one gene. A characteristic likecleft chin, for example, is influenced by a single gene from each parent. In this example, we will call the genefor cleft chin \u201cB,\u201d and the gene for smooth chin \u201cb.\u201d Cleft chin is a dominant trait, which means that having thedominant allele either from one parent (Bb) or both parents (BB) will always result in the phenotypeassociated with the dominant allele. When someone has two copies of the same allele, they are said to behomozygous for that allele. When someone has a combination of alleles for a given gene, they are said to beheterozygous. For example, smooth chin is a recessive trait, which means that an individual will only displaythe smooth chin phenotype if they are homozygous for that recessive allele (bb).Imagine that a person with a cleft chin mates with a person with a smooth chin. What type of chin will theiroffspring have? The answer to that depends on which alleles each parent carries. If the person with a cleft ishomozygous for cleft chin (BB), their offspring will always have cleft chin. It gets a little more complicated,however, if the person is heterozygous for this gene (Bb). Since the other person has a smooth chin\u2014thereforehomozygous for the recessive allele (bb)\u2014we can expect the offspring to have a 50% chance of having a cleftchin and a 50% chance of having a smooth chin (Figure 3.5).FIGURE 3.5 (a) A Punnett square is a tool used to predict how genes will interact in the production of offspring. Thecapital B represents the dominant allele, and the lowercase b represents the recessive allele. In the example of thecleft chin, where B is cleft chin (dominant allele), wherever a pair contains the dominant allele, B, you can expect acleft chin phenotype. You can expect a smooth chin phenotype only when there are two copies of the recessiveallele, bb. (b) A cleft chin, shown here, is an inherited trait.In sickle cell anemia, heterozygous carriers (like Luwi from the example) can develop blood resistance tomalaria infection while those who are homozygous (like Sena) have a potentially lethal blood disorder. Sickle-cell anemia is just one of many genetic disorders caused by the pairing of two recessive genes. For example,phenylketonuria (PKU) is a condition in which individuals lack an enzyme that normally converts harmfulamino acids into harmless byproducts. If someone with this condition goes untreated, they will experiencesignificant deficits in cognitive function, seizures, and an increased risk of various psychiatric disorders.Because PKU is a recessive trait, each parent must have at least one copy of the recessive allele in order toproduce a child with the condition (Figure 3.6).So far, we have discussed traits that involve just one gene, but few human characteristics are controlled by asingle gene. Most traits are polygenic: controlled by more than one gene. Height is one example of a polygenictrait, as are skin color and weight."

If two individuals mate who are both heterozygous for the allele associated with PKU, theiroffspring have a 25% chance of expressing the PKU phenotype.Where do harmful genes that contribute to diseases like PKU come from? Gene mutations provide one sourceof harmful genes. A mutation is a sudden, permanent change in a gene. While many mutations can be harmfulor lethal, once in a while, a mutation benefits an individual by giving that person an advantage over those whodo not have the mutation. Recall that the theory of evolution asserts that individuals best adapted to theirparticular environments are more likely to reproduce and pass on their genes to future generations. In orderfor this process to occur, there must be competition\u2014more technically, there must be variability in genes (andresultant traits) that allow for variation in adaptability to the environment. If a population consisted ofidentical individuals, then any dramatic changes in the environment would affect everyone in the same way,and there would be no variation in selection. In contrast, diversity in genes and associated traits allows someindividuals to perform slightly better than others when faced with environmental change. This creates adistinct advantage for individuals best suited for their environments in terms of successful reproduction andgenetic transmission.DIG DEEPERHuman DiversityThis chapter focuses on biology. Later in this course you will learn about social psychology and issues of race,prejudice, and discrimination. When we focus strictly on biology, race becomes a weak construct. After thesequencing of the human genome at the turn of the millennium, many scientists began to argue that race was nota useful variable in genetic research and that its continued use represents a potential source of confusion andharm. The racial categories that some believed to be helpful in studying genetic diversity in humans are largelyirrelevant. A person's skin tone, eye color, and hair texture are functions of their genetic makeups, but there isactually more genetic variation within a given racial category than there is between racial categories. In somecases, focus on race has led to difficulties with misdiagnoses and/or under-diagnoses of diseases ranging fromsickle cell anemia to cystic fibrosis. Some argue that we need to distinguish between ancestry and race and thenfocus on ancestry. This approach would facilitate greater understanding of human genetic diversity (Yudell,Roberts, DeSalle, & Tishkoff, 2016)."

Although we are all biological organisms, we also exist in an environment thatis incredibly important in determining not only when and how our genes express themselves, but also in whatcombination. Each of us represents a unique interaction between our genetic makeup and our environment;range of reaction is one way to describe this interaction. Range of reaction asserts that our genes set theboundaries within which we can operate, and our environment interacts with the genes to determine where inthat range we will fall. For example, if an individual\u2019s genetic makeup predisposes them to high levels ofintellectual potential and they are reared in a rich, stimulating environment, then they will be more likely toachieve full potential than if they were raised under conditions of significant deprivation. According to theconcept of range of reaction, genes set definite limits on potential, and environment determines how much ofthat potential is achieved. Some disagree with this theory and argue that genes do not set a limit on a person\u2019spotential with reaction norms being determined by the environment. For example, when individualsexperience neglect or abuse early in life, they are more likely to exhibit adverse psychological and/or physicalconditions that can last throughout their lives. These conditions may develop as a function of the negativeenvironmental experiences in individuals from dissimilar genetic backgrounds (Miguel, Pereira, Silveira, &Meaney, 2019; Short & Baram, 2019).Another perspective on the interaction between genes and the environment is the concept of geneticenvironmental correlation. Stated simply, our genes influence our environment, and our environmentinfluences the expression of our genes (Figure 3.7). Not only do our genes and environment interact, as inrange of reaction, but they also influence one another bidirectionally. For example, the child of an NBA playerwould probably be exposed to basketball from an early age. Such exposure might allow the child to realizetheir full genetic, athletic potential. Thus, the parents\u2019 genes, which the child shares, influence the child\u2019senvironment, and that environment, in turn, is well suited to support the child\u2019s genetic potential.FIGURE 3.7 Nature and nurture work together like complex pieces of a human puzzle. The interaction of ourenvironment and genes makes us the individuals we are. (credit \"puzzle\": modification of work by Cory Zanker)In another approach to gene-environment interactions, the field of epigenetics looks beyond the genotypeitself and studies how the same genotype can be expressed in different ways. In other words, researchers studyhow the same genotype can lead to very different phenotypes. As mentioned earlier, gene expression is ofteninfluenced by environmental context in ways that are not entirely obvious. For instance, identical twins sharethe same genetic information (identical twins develop from a single fertilized egg that split, so the geneticmaterial is exactly the same in each; in contrast, fraternal twins usually result from two different eggsfertilized by different sperm, so the genetic material varies as with non-twin siblings). But even with identicalgenes, there remains an incredible amount of variability in how gene expression can unfold over the course ofeach twin\u2019s life. Sometimes, one twin will develop a disease and the other will not. In one example, Aliya, anidentical twin, died from cancer at age 7, but her twin, now 19 years old, has never had cancer. Although theseindividuals share an identical genotype, their phenotypes differ as a result of how that genetic information is"

Indeed, scientists have found genetic linkages to anumber of behavioral characteristics, ranging from basic personality traits to sexual orientation to spirituality(for examples, see Mustanski et al., 2005; Comings, Gonzales, Saucier, Johnson, & MacMurray, 2000). Genes arealso associated with temperament and a number of psychological disorders, such as depression andschizophrenia. So while it is true that genes provide the biological blueprints for our cells, tissues, organs, andbody, they also have a significant impact on our experiences and our behaviors.Let\u2019s look at the following findings regarding schizophrenia in light of our three views of gene-environmentinteractions. Which view do you think best explains this evidence?In a 2004 study by Tienari and colleagues, adoptees whose biological mothers had schizophrenia andwho hadbeen raised in a disturbed family environment were much more likely to develop schizophrenia or anotherpsychotic disorder than were any of the other groups in the study:\u2022 Of adoptees whose biological mothers had schizophrenia (high genetic risk) and who were raised indisturbed family environments, 36.8% were likely to develop schizophrenia.\u2022 Of adoptees whose biological mothers had schizophrenia (high genetic risk) and who were raised inhealthy family environments, 5.8% were likely to develop schizophrenia.\u2022 Of adoptees with a low genetic risk (whose mothers did not have schizophrenia) and who were raised indisturbed family environments, 5.3% were likely to develop schizophrenia.\u2022 Of adoptees with a low genetic risk (whose mothers did not have schizophrenia) and who were raised inhealthy family environments, 4.8% were likely to develop schizophrenia.The study shows that adoptees with high genetic risk were most likely to develop schizophrenia if they wereraised in disturbed home environments. This research lends credibility to the notion that both geneticvulnerability and environmental stress are necessary for schizophrenia to develop, and that genes alone do nottell the full tale."

This section briefly describes the structure and function of neurons.Neuron StructureNeurons are the central building blocks of the nervous system, 100 billion strong at birth. Like all cells,neurons consist of several different parts, each serving a specialized function (Figure 3.8). A neuron\u2019s outersurface is made up of a semipermeable membrane. This membrane allows smaller molecules and moleculeswithout an electrical charge to pass through it, while stopping larger or highly charged molecules.FIGURE 3.8 This illustration shows a prototypical neuron, which is being myelinated by a glial cell.The nucleus of the neuron is located in the soma, or cell body. The soma has branching extensions known asdendrites. The neuron is a small information processor, and dendrites serve as input sites where signals arereceived from other neurons. These signals are transmitted electrically across the soma and down a majorextension from the soma known as the axon, which ends at multiple terminal buttons. The terminal buttonscontain synaptic vesicles that house neurotransmitters, the chemical messengers of the nervous system.Axons range in length from a fraction of an inch to several feet. In some axons, glial cells form a fatty substanceknown as the myelin sheath, which coats the axon and acts as an insulator, increasing the speed at which thesignal travels. The myelin sheath is not continuous and there are small gaps that occur down the length of theaxon. These gaps in the myelin sheath are known as the Nodes of Ranvier. The myelin sheath is crucial for thenormal operation of the neurons within the nervous system: the loss of the insulation it provides can bedetrimental to normal function. To understand how this works, let\u2019s consider an example. PKU, a geneticdisorder discussed earlier, causes a reduction in myelin and abnormalities in white matter cortical andsubcortical structures. The disorder is associated with a variety of issues including severe cognitive deficits,exaggerated reflexes, and seizures (Anderson & Leuzzi, 2010; Huttenlocher, 2000). Another disorder, multiplesclerosis (MS), an autoimmune disorder, involves a large-scale loss of the myelin sheath on axons throughoutthe nervous system. The resulting interference in the electrical signal prevents the quick transmittal ofinformation by neurons and can lead to a number of symptoms, such as dizziness, fatigue, loss of motorcontrol, and sexual dysfunction. While some treatments may help to modify the course of the disease andmanage certain symptoms, there is currently no known cure for multiple sclerosis.In healthy individuals, the neuronal signal moves rapidly down the axon to the terminal buttons, wheresynaptic vesicles release neurotransmitters into the synaptic cleft (Figure 3.9). The synaptic cleft is a verysmall space between two neurons and is an important site where communication between neurons occurs.Once neurotransmitters are released into the synaptic cleft, they travel across it and bind with correspondingreceptors on the dendrite of an adjacent neuron. Receptors, proteins on the cell surface whereneurotransmitters attach, vary in shape, with different shapes \u201cmatching\u201d different neurotransmitters.How does a neurotransmitter \u201cknow\u201d which receptor to bind to?

The neuron exists in a fluid environment\u2014it is surrounded byextracellular fluid and contains intracellular fluid (i.e., cytoplasm). The neuronal membrane keeps these twofluids separate\u2014a critical role because the electrical signal that passes through the neuron depends on theintra- and extracellular fluids being electrically different. This difference in charge across the membrane,called the membrane potential, provides energy for the signal.The electrical charge of the fluids is caused by charged molecules (ions) dissolved in the fluid. Thesemipermeable nature of the neuronal membrane somewhat restricts the movement of these chargedmolecules, and, as a result, some of the charged particles tend to become more concentrated either inside oroutside the cell.Between signals, the neuron membrane\u2019s potential is held in a state of readiness, called the resting potential.Like a rubber band stretched out and waiting to spring into action, ions line up on either side of the cellmembrane, ready to rush across the membrane when the neuron goes active and the membrane opens itsgates. Ions in high-concentration areas are ready to move to low-concentration areas, and positive ions areready to move to areas with a negative charge.In the resting state, sodium (Na+) is at higher concentrations outside the cell, so it will tend to move into thecell. Potassium (K+), on the other hand, is more concentrated inside the cell, and will tend to move out of thecell (Figure 3.10). In addition, the inside of the cell is slightly negatively charged compared to the outside, dueto the activity of the sodium-potassium pump. This pump actively transports three sodium ions out of the cellfor every two potassium ions in, creating a net negative charge inside the cell. This provides an additionalforce on sodium, causing it to move into the cell."

Other molecules, such as chloride ions (yellow circles) and negatively chargedproteins (brown squares), help contribute to a positive net charge in the extracellular fluid and a negative net chargein the intracellular fluid.From this resting potential state, the neuron receives a signal and its state changes abruptly (Figure 3.11).When a neuron receives signals at the dendrites\u2014due to neurotransmitters from an adjacent neuron bindingto its receptors\u2014small pores, or gates, open on the neuronal membrane, allowing Na+ ions, propelled by bothcharge and concentration differences, to move into the cell. With this influx of positive ions, the internalcharge of the cell becomes more positive. If that charge reaches a certain level, called the threshold ofexcitation, the neuron becomes active and the action potential begins.Many additional pores open, causing a massive influx of Na+ ions and a huge positive spike in the membranepotential, the peak action potential. At the peak of the spike, the sodium gates close and the potassium gatesopen. As positively charged potassium ions leave, the cell quickly begins repolarization. At first, ithyperpolarizes, becoming slightly more negative than the resting potential, and then it levels off, returning tothe resting potential.FIGURE 3.11 During the action potential, the electrical charge across the membrane changes dramatically.This positive spike constitutes the action potential: the electrical signal that typically moves from the cell bodydown the axon to the axon terminals. The electrical signal moves down the axon with the impulses jumping ina leapfrog fashion between the Nodes of Ranvier.

In simple terms, this means that an incoming signal fromanother neuron is either sufficient or insufficient to reach the threshold of excitation. There is no in-between,and there is no turning off an action potential once it starts. Think of it like sending an email or a text message.You can think about sending it all you want, but the message is not sent until you hit the send button.Furthermore, once you send the message, there is no stopping it.Because it is all or none, the action potential is recreated, or propagated, at its full strength at every point alongthe axon. Much like the lit fuse of a firecracker, it does not fade away as it travels down the axon. It is this all-or-none property that explains the fact that your brain perceives an injury to a distant body part like your toe asequally painful as one to your nose.As noted earlier, when the action potential arrives at the terminal button, the synaptic vesicles release theirneurotransmitters into the synaptic cleft. The neurotransmitters travel across the synapse and bind toreceptors on the dendrites of the adjacent neuron, and the process repeats itself in the new neuron (assumingthe signal is sufficiently strong to trigger an action potential). Once the signal is delivered, excessneurotransmitters in the synaptic cleft drift away, are broken down into inactive fragments, or are reabsorbedin a process known as reuptake. Reuptake involves the neurotransmitter being pumped back into the neuronthat released it, in order to clear the synapse (Figure 3.12). Clearing the synapse serves both to provide a clear\u201con\u201d and \u201coff\u201d state between signals and to regulate the production of neurotransmitter (full synaptic vesiclesprovide signals that no additional neurotransmitters need to be produced).FIGURE 3.12 Reuptake involves moving a neurotransmitter from the synapse back into the axon terminal fromwhich it was released.Neuronal communication is often referred to as an electrochemical event. The movement of the actionpotential down the length of the axon is an electrical event, and movement of the neurotransmitter across thesynaptic space represents the chemical portion of the process. However, there are some specializedconnections between neurons that are entirely electrical. In such cases, the neurons are said to communicatevia an electrical synapse. In these cases, two neurons physically connect to one another via gap junctions,which allows the current from one cell to pass into the next. There are far fewer electrical synapses in thebrain, but those that do exist are much faster than the chemical synapses that have been described above(Connors & Long, 2004).LINK TO LEARNINGWatch this video about neuronal communication (http://openstax.org/l/neuroncom) to learn more."

Much of whatpsychologists know about the functions of neurotransmitters comes from research on the effects of drugs inpsychological disorders. Psychologists who take a biological perspective and focus on the physiologicalcauses of behavior assert that psychological disorders like depression and schizophrenia are associated withimbalances in one or more neurotransmitter systems. In this perspective, psychotropic medications can helpimprove the symptoms associated with these disorders. Psychotropic medications are drugs that treatpsychiatric symptoms by restoring neurotransmitter balance.Major Neurotransmitters and How They Affect BehaviorNeurotransmitterInvolved inPotential Effect on BehaviorAcetylcholineBeta-endorphinDopamineMuscle action, memoryIncreased arousal, enhanced cognitionPain, pleasureDecreased anxiety, decreased tensionMood, sleep, learningIncreased pleasure, suppressed appetiteGamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) Brain function, sleepDecreased anxiety, decreased tensionGlutamateNorepinephrineSerotoninTABLE 3.1Memory, learningIncreased learning, enhanced memoryHeart, intestines, alertnessIncreased arousal, suppressed appetiteMood, sleepModulated mood, suppressed appetitePsychoactive drugs can act as agonists or antagonists for a given neurotransmitter system. Agonists arechemicals that mimic a neurotransmitter at the receptor site. An antagonist, on the other hand, blocks orimpedes the normal activity of a neurotransmitter at the receptor. Agonists and antagonists represent drugsthat are prescribed to correct the specific neurotransmitter imbalances underlying a person\u2019s condition. Forexample, Parkinson's disease, a progressive nervous system disorder, is associated with low levels ofdopamine. Therefore, a common treatment strategy for Parkinson's disease involves using dopamine agonists,which mimic the effects of dopamine by binding to dopamine receptors.Certain symptoms of schizophrenia are associated with overactive dopamine neurotransmission. Theantipsychotics used to treat these symptoms are antagonists for dopamine\u2014they block dopamine\u2019s effects bybinding its receptors without activating them. Thus, they prevent dopamine released by one neuron fromsignaling information to adjacent neurons.In contrast to agonists and antagonists, which both operate by binding to receptor sites, reuptake inhibitorsprevent unused neurotransmitters from being transported back to the neuron. This allows neurotransmittersto remain active in the synaptic cleft for longer durations, increasing their effectiveness. Depression, whichhas been consistently linked with reduced serotonin levels, is commonly treated with selective serotoninreuptake inhibitors (SSRIs). By preventing reuptake, SSRIs strengthen the effect of serotonin, giving it moretime to interact with serotonin receptors on dendrites. Common SSRIs on the market today include Prozac,Paxil, and Zoloft. The drug LSD is structurally very similar to serotonin, and it affects the same neurons andreceptors as serotonin.

Itis involved in the relay of sensory and motor information to and from the CNS; therefore, it consists of motorneurons and sensory neurons. Motor neurons, carrying instructions from the CNS to the muscles, are efferentfibers (efferent means \u201cmoving away from\u201d). Sensory neurons, carrying sensory information to the CNS, areafferent fibers (afferent means \u201cmoving toward\u201d). A helpful way to remember this is that efferent = exit andafferent = arrive. Each nerve is basically a bundle of neurons forming a two-way superhighway, containingthousands of axons, both efferent and afferent.The autonomic nervous system controls our internal organs and glands and is generally considered to beoutside the realm of voluntary control. It can be further subdivided into the sympathetic and parasympatheticdivisions (Figure 3.14). The sympathetic nervous system is involved in preparing the body for stress-relatedactivities; the parasympathetic nervous system is associated with returning the body to routine, day-to-dayoperations.

For example, think about how you feel when you have to stand up and give a presentation in front ofa roomful of people, or right before taking a big test. You are in no real physical danger in those situations, andyet you have evolved to respond to a perceived threat with the fight or flight response. This kind of response isnot nearly as adaptive in the modern world; in fact, we suffer negative health consequences when facedconstantly with psychological threats that we can neither fight nor flee.

In this section, we discuss the overall organization of the brain andthe functions associated with different brain areas, beginning with what can be seen as an extension of thebrain, the spinal cord.The Spinal CordIt can be said that the spinal cord is what connects the brain to the outside world. Because of it, the brain canact. The spinal cord is like a relay station, but a very smart one. It not only routes messages to and from thebrain, but it also has its own system of automatic processes, called reflexes.The top of the spinal cord is a bundle of nerves that merges with the brain stem, where the basic processes oflife are controlled, such as breathing and digestion. In the opposite direction, the spinal cord ends just belowthe ribs\u2014contrary to what we might expect, it does not extend all the way to the base of the spine.The spinal cord is functionally organized in 30 segments, corresponding with the vertebrae. Each segment isconnected to a specific part of the body through the peripheral nervous system. Nerves branch out from thespine at each vertebra. Sensory nerves bring messages in; motor nerves send messages out to the muscles andorgans. Messages travel to and from the brain through every segment.Some sensory messages are immediately acted on by the spinal cord, without any input from the brain."

When a sensory message meets certainparameters, the spinal cord initiates an automatic reflex. The signal passes from the sensory nerve to a simpleprocessing center, which initiates a motor command. Seconds are saved, because messages don\u2019t have to gothe brain, be processed, and get sent back. In matters of survival, the spinal reflexes allow the body to reactextraordinarily fast.The spinal cord is protected by bony vertebrae and cushioned in cerebrospinal fluid, but injuries still occur.When the spinal cord is damaged in a particular segment, all lower segments are cut off from the brain,causing paralysis. Therefore, the lower on the spine damage occurs, the fewer functions an injured individualwill lose.NeuroplasticityBob Woodruff, a reporter for ABC, suffered a traumatic brain injury after a bomb exploded next to the vehiclehe was in while covering a news story in Iraq. As a consequence of these injuries, Woodruff experienced manycognitive deficits including difficulties with memory and language. However, over time and with the aid ofintensive amounts of cognitive and speech therapy, Woodruff has shown an incredible recovery of function(Fernandez, 2008, October 16).One of the factors that made this recovery possible was neuroplasticity. Neuroplasticity refers to how thenervous system can change and adapt. Neuroplasticity can occur in a variety of ways including personalexperiences, developmental processes, or, as in Woodruff's case, in response to some sort of damage or injurythat has occurred. Neuroplasticity can involve creation of new synapses, pruning of synapses that are nolonger used, changes in glial cells, and even the birth of new neurons. Because of neuroplasticity, our brainsare constantly changing and adapting, and while our nervous system is most plastic when we are very young,as Woodruff's case suggests, it is still capable of remarkable changes later in life.The Two HemispheresThe surface of the brain, known as the cerebral cortex, is very uneven, characterized by a distinctive patternof folds or bumps, known as gyri (singular: gyrus), and grooves, known as sulci (singular: sulcus), shown inFigure 3.15. These gyri and sulci form important landmarks that allow us to separate the brain into functionalcenters. The most prominent sulcus, known as the longitudinal fissure, is the deep groove that separates thebrain into two halves or hemispheres: the left hemisphere and the right hemisphere.FIGURE 3.15 The surface of the brain is covered with gyri and sulci. A deep sulcus is called a fissure, such as thelongitudinal fissure that divides the brain into left and right hemispheres.

The right hemisphere, on the other hand, has been shown to be superior inpitch perception, arousal, and negative emotions (Ehret, 2006). However, it should be pointed out thatresearch on which hemisphere is dominant in a variety of different behaviors has produced inconsistentresults, and therefore, it is probably better to think of how the two hemispheres interact to produce a givenbehavior rather than attributing certain behaviors to one hemisphere versus the other (Banich & Heller, 1998).The two hemispheres are connected by a thick band of neural fibers known as the corpus callosum, consistingof about 200 million axons. The corpus callosum allows the two hemispheres to communicate with each otherand allows for information being processed on one side of the brain to be shared with the other side.Normally, we are not aware of the different roles that our two hemispheres play in day-to-day functions, butthere are people who come to know the capabilities and functions of their two hemispheres quite well. In somecases of severe epilepsy, doctors elect to sever the corpus callosum as a means of controlling the spread ofseizures (Figure 3.16). While this is an effective treatment option, it results in individuals who have \"splitbrains.\" After surgery, these split-brain patients show a variety of interesting behaviors. For instance, a split-brain patient is unable to name a picture that is shown in the patient\u2019s left visual field because the informationis only available in the largely nonverbal right hemisphere. However, they are able to recreate the picture withtheir left hand, which is also controlled by the right hemisphere. When the more verbal left hemisphere seesthe picture that the hand drew, the patient is able to name it (assuming the left hemisphere can interpret whatwas drawn by the left hand).FIGURE 3.16 (a, b) The corpus callosum connects the left and right hemispheres of the brain. (c) A scientistspreads this dissected sheep brain apart to show the corpus callosum between the hemispheres. (credit c:modification of work by Aaron Bornstein)Much of what we know about the functions of different areas of the brain comes from studying changes in thebehavior and ability of individuals who have suffered damage to the brain. For example, researchers study thebehavioral changes caused by strokes to learn about the functions of specific brain areas. A stroke, caused byan interruption of blood flow to a region in the brain, causes a loss of brain function in the affected region. Thedamage can be in a small area, and, if it is, this gives researchers the opportunity to link any resultingbehavioral changes to a specific area. The types of deficits displayed after a stroke will be largely dependent onwhere in the brain the damage occurred.Consider Theona, an intelligent, self-sufficient woman, who is 62 years old. Recently, she suffered a stroke inthe front portion of her right hemisphere. As a result, she has great difficulty moving her left leg. (As youlearned earlier, the right hemisphere controls the left side of the body; also, the brain\u2019s main motor centers arelocated at the front of the head, in the frontal lobe.) Theona has also experienced behavioral changes. Forexample, while in the produce section of the grocery store, she sometimes eats grapes, strawberries, andapples directly from their bins before paying for them. This behavior\u2014which would have been veryembarrassing to her before the stroke\u2014is consistent with damage in another region in the frontal lobe\u2014the"

The forebrain contains the cerebral cortex and a number of other structures that lie beneath thecortex (called subcortical structures): thalamus, hypothalamus, pituitary gland, and the limbic system (acollection of structures). The cerebral cortex, which is the outer surface of the brain, is associated with higherlevel processes such as consciousness, thought, emotion, reasoning, language, and memory. Each cerebralhemisphere can be subdivided into four lobes, each associated with different functions.FIGURE 3.17 The brain and its parts can be divided into three main categories: the forebrain, midbrain, andhindbrain.Lobes of the BrainThe four lobes of the brain are the frontal, parietal, temporal, and occipital lobes (Figure 3.18). The frontallobe is located in the forward part of the brain, extending back to a fissure known as the central sulcus. Thefrontal lobe is involved in reasoning, motor control, emotion, and language. It contains the motor cortex,which is involved in planning and coordinating movement; the prefrontal cortex, which is responsible forhigher-level cognitive functioning; and Broca\u2019s area, which is essential for language production.FIGURE 3.18 The lobes of the brain are shown.People who suffer damage to Broca\u2019s area have great difficulty producing language of any form (Figure 3.18).For example, Padma was an electrical engineer who was socially active and a caring, involved parent.

She can do routine tasks like running to the market to buy milk, but she could notcommunicate verbally if a situation called for it.Probably the most famous case of frontal lobe damage is that of a man by the name of Phineas Gage. OnSeptember 13, 1848, Gage (age 25) was working as a railroad foreman in Vermont. He and his crew were usingan iron rod to tamp explosives down into a blasting hole to remove rock along the railway\u2019s path.Unfortunately, the iron rod created a spark and caused the rod to explode out of the blasting hole, into Gage\u2019sface, and through his skull (Figure 3.19). Although lying in a pool of his own blood with brain matter emergingfrom his head, Gage was conscious and able to get up, walk, and speak. But in the months following hisaccident, people noticed that his personality had changed. Many of his friends described him as no longerbeing himself. Before the accident, it was said that Gage was a well-mannered, soft-spoken man, but he beganto behave in odd and inappropriate ways after the accident. Such changes in personality would be consistentwith loss of impulse control\u2014a frontal lobe function.Beyond the damage to the frontal lobe itself, subsequent investigations into the rod's path also identifiedprobable damage to pathways between the frontal lobe and other brain structures, including the limbicsystem. With connections between the planning functions of the frontal lobe and the emotional processes ofthe limbic system severed, Gage had difficulty controlling his emotional impulses.However, there is some evidence suggesting that the dramatic changes in Gage\u2019s personality were exaggeratedand embellished. Gage's case occurred in the midst of a 19th century debate over localization\u2014regardingwhether certain areas of the brain are associated with particular functions. On the basis of extremely limitedinformation about Gage, the extent of his injury, and his life before and after the accident, scientists tended tofind support for their own views, on whichever side of the debate they fell (Macmillan, 1999).FIGURE 3.19 (a) Phineas Gage holds the iron rod that penetrated his skull in an 1848 railroad constructionaccident. (b) Gage\u2019s prefrontal cortex was severely damaged in the left hemisphere. The rod entered Gage\u2019s face onthe left side, passed behind his eye, and exited through the top of his skull, before landing about 80 feet away.(credit a: modification of work by Jack and Beverly Wilgus)The brain\u2019s parietal lobe is located immediately behind the frontal lobe, and is involved in processinginformation from the body\u2019s senses. It contains the somatosensory cortex, which is essential for processingsensory information from across the body, such as touch, temperature, and pain. The somatosensory cortex isan area of the brain which processes touch and sensation. The somatosensory cortex is fascinating becauseeach different area of the cortex processes sensations from a different part of your body. Furthermore, thelarger the surface area of the specific body part and the greater amount of nerves in that body part, the largerthe area dedicated to processing sensation from that body part in the somatosensory cortex.

All of our senses, with the exception of smell, are routed throughthe thalamus before being directed to other areas of the brain for processing (Figure 3.22).FIGURE 3.22 The thalamus serves as the relay center of the brain where most senses are routed for processing.The limbic system is involved in processing both emotion and memory. Interestingly, the sense of smellprojects directly to the limbic system; therefore, not surprisingly, smell can evoke emotional responses in waysthat other sensory modalities cannot. The limbic system is made up of a number of different structures, butthree of the most important are the hippocampus, the amygdala, and the hypothalamus (Figure 3.23). Thehippocampus is an essential structure for learning and memory. The amygdala is involved in our experienceof emotion and in tying emotional meaning to our memories. The hypothalamus regulates a number ofhomeostatic processes, including the regulation of body temperature, appetite, and blood pressure. Thehypothalamus also serves as an interface between the nervous system and the endocrine system and in theregulation of sexual motivation and behavior.FIGURE 3.23 The limbic system is involved in mediating emotional response and memory."

The reticular formation is centered in the midbrain, but it actually extends up into the forebrainand down into the hindbrain. The reticular formation is important in regulating the sleep/wake cycle, arousal,alertness, and motor activity.The substantia nigra (Latin for \u201cblack substance\u201d) and the ventral tegmental area (VTA) are also located inthe midbrain (Figure 3.24). Both regions contain cell bodies that produce the neurotransmitter dopamine, andboth are critical for movement. Degeneration of the substantia nigra and VTA is involved in Parkinson\u2019sdisease. In addition, these structures are involved in mood, reward, and addiction (Berridge & Robinson, 1998;Gardner, 2011; George, Le Moal, & Koob, 2012).FIGURE 3.24 The substantia nigra and ventral tegmental area (VTA) are located in the midbrain.The hindbrain is located at the back of the head and looks like an extension of the spinal cord.

Whose decision should it be to remove a feeding tube? Should medical care costs be afactor?On February 25, 1990, a Florida woman named Terri Schiavo went into cardiac arrest, apparently triggered by abulimic episode. She was eventually revived, but her brain had been deprived of oxygen for a long time. Brainscans indicated that there was no activity in her cerebral cortex, and she suffered from severe and permanentcerebral atrophy. Basically, Schiavo was in a vegetative state. Medical professionals determined that she wouldnever again be able to move, talk, or respond in any way. To remain alive, she required a feeding tube, and therewas no chance that her situation would ever improve.On occasion, Schiavo\u2019s eyes would move, and sometimes she would groan. Despite the doctors\u2019 insistence to thecontrary, her parents believed that these were signs that she was trying to communicate with them.After 12 years, Schiavo\u2019s husband argued that his wife would not have wanted to be kept alive with no feelings,sensations, or brain activity.

What do you thinkabout these issues?Brain ImagingYou have learned how brain injury can provide information about the functions of different parts of the brain.Increasingly, however, we are able to obtain that information using brain imaging techniques on individualswho have not suffered brain injury. In this section, we take a more in-depth look at some of the techniques thatare available for imaging the brain, including techniques that rely on radiation, magnetic fields, or electricalactivity within the brain.Techniques Involving RadiationA computerized tomography (CT) scan involves taking a number of x-rays of a particular section of a person\u2019sbody or brain (Figure 3.26). The x-rays pass through tissues of different densities at different rates, allowing acomputer to construct an overall image of the area of the body being scanned. A CT scan is often used todetermine whether someone has a tumor or significant brain atrophy.FIGURE 3.26 A CT scan can be used to show brain tumors.

Anindividual receiving a PET scan drinks or is injected with a mildly radioactive substance, called a tracer. Oncein the bloodstream, the amount of tracer in any given region of the brain can be monitored. As a brain areabecomes more active, more blood flows to that area. A computer monitors the movement of the tracer andcreates a rough map of active and inactive areas of the brain during a given behavior. PET scans show littledetail, are unable to pinpoint events precisely in time, and require that the brain be exposed to radiation;therefore, this technique has been replaced by the fMRI as an alternative diagnostic tool.

The magnetic field causes the hydrogen atoms in the body\u2019s cells to move. When the magnetic field isturned off, the hydrogen atoms emit electromagnetic signals as they return to their original positions. Tissuesof different densities give off different signals, which a computer interprets and displays on a monitor.Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) operates on the same principles, but it shows changes inbrain activity over time by tracking blood flow and oxygen levels. The fMRI provides more detailed images ofthe brain\u2019s structure, as well as better accuracy in time, than is possible in PET scans (Figure 3.28). With theirhigh level of detail, MRI and fMRI are often used to compare the brains of healthy individuals to the brains ofindividuals diagnosed with psychological disorders.

However, unlike neurotransmitters, which are released in close proximity to cellswith their receptors, hormones are secreted into the bloodstream and travel throughout the body, affecting anycells that contain receptors for them.

Imbalances in hormones are related to a number of disorders. This section explores someof the major glands that make up the endocrine system and the hormones secreted by these glands (Table 3.2).Major GlandsThe pituitary gland descends from the hypothalamus at the base of the brain, and acts in close associationwith it. The pituitary is often referred to as the \u201cmaster gland\u201d because its messenger hormones control all theother glands in the endocrine system, although it mostly carries out instructions from the hypothalamus. Inaddition to messenger hormones, the pituitary also secretes growth hormone, endorphins for pain relief, and anumber of key hormones that regulate fluid levels in the body.Located in the neck, the thyroid gland releases hormones that regulate growth, metabolism, and appetite. Inhyperthyroidism, or Grave\u2019s disease, the thyroid secretes too much of the hormone thyroxine, causingagitation, bulging eyes, and weight loss. In hypothyroidism, reduced hormone levels cause sufferers toexperience tiredness, and they often complain of feeling cold. Fortunately, thyroid disorders are often treatablewith medications that help reestablish a balance in the hormones secreted by the thyroid.The adrenal glands sit atop our kidneys and secrete hormones involved in the stress response, such asepinephrine (adrenaline) and norepinephrine (noradrenaline). The pancreas is an internal organ that secreteshormones that regulate blood sugar levels: insulin and glucagon. These pancreatic hormones are essential formaintaining stable levels of blood sugar throughout the day by lowering blood glucose levels (insulin) orraising them (glucagon). People who suffer from diabetes do not produce enough insulin; therefore, they musttake medications that stimulate or replace insulin production, and they must closely control the amount ofsugars and carbohydrates they consume.The gonads secrete sexual hormones, which are important in reproduction, and mediate both sexualmotivation and behavior. The female gonads are the ovaries; the male gonads are the testes. Ovaries secreteestrogens and progesterone, and the testes secrete androgens, such as testosterone."

The drugs are believed to enhance athletic performance. Anabolic steroid drugs mimic the effects of thebody\u2019s own steroid hormones, like testosterone and its derivatives. These drugs have the potential to provide acompetitive edge by increasing muscle mass, strength, and endurance, although not all users may experiencethese results. Moreover, use of performance-enhancing drugs (PEDs) does not come without risks. Anabolicsteroid use has been linked with a wide variety of potentially negative outcomes, ranging in severity from largelycosmetic (acne) to life threatening (heart attack). Furthermore, use of these substances can result in profoundchanges in mood and can increase aggressive behavior (National Institute on Drug Abuse, 2001).Baseball player Alex Rodriguez (A-Rod) spent the latter part of his playing career at the center of a media stormregarding his use of illegal PEDs. Rodriguez excelled while using the drugs; his success played a large role innegotiating a contract that made him the highest paid player in professional baseball. A subsequent scandal andsuspension tarnished his reputation and, according to a statement he made once retired, cost him over $40million. Even lower-profile athletes, particularly in cycling and Olympic sports, have been revealed as steroidusers. What are your thoughts on athletes and doping? Why or why not should the use of PEDs be banned? Whatadvice would you give an athlete who was considering using PEDs?"

Awareness of internal stimuliincludes feeling pain, hunger, thirst, sleepiness, and being aware of our thoughts and emotions. Awareness ofexternal stimuli includes experiences such as seeing the light from the sun, feeling the warmth of a room, andhearing the voice of a friend.We experience different states of consciousness and different levels of awareness on a regular basis. We mighteven describe consciousness as a continuum that ranges from full awareness to a deep sleep. Sleep is a statemarked by relatively low levels of physical activity and reduced sensory awareness that is distinct from periodsof rest that occur during wakefulness. Wakefulness is characterized by high levels of sensory awareness,thought, and behavior. Beyond being awake or asleep, there are many other states of consciousness peopleexperience. These include daydreaming, intoxication, and unconsciousness due to anesthesia. We might alsoexperience unconscious states of being via drug-induced anesthesia for medical purposes. Often, we are notcompletely aware of our surroundings, even when we are fully awake. For instance, have you ever daydreamedwhile driving home from work or school without really thinking about the drive itself? You were capable ofengaging in the all of the complex tasks involved with operating a motor vehicle even though you were notaware of doing so. Many of these processes, like much of psychological behavior, are rooted in our biology.Biological RhythmsBiological rhythms are internal rhythms of biological activity. A woman\u2019s menstrual cycle is an example of abiological rhythm\u2014a recurring, cyclical pattern of bodily changes. One complete menstrual cycle takes about28 days\u2014a lunar month\u2014but many biological cycles are much shorter. For example, body temperaturefluctuates cyclically over a 24-hour period (Figure 4.2). Alertness is associated with higher body temperatures,and sleepiness with lower body temperatures.FIGURE 4.2 This chart illustrates the circadian change in body temperature over 28 hours in a group of eight youngmen. Body temperature rises throughout the waking day, peaking in the afternoon, and falls during sleep with thelowest point occurring during the very early morning hours."

        "data": "Page 1114.1 \u2022 What Is Consciousness? 111This pattern of temperature fluctuation, which repeats every day, is one example of a circadian rhythm. Acircadian rhythm is a biological rhythm that takes place over a period of about 24 hours. Our sleep-wakecycle, which is linked to our environment\u2019s natural light-dark cycle, is perhaps the most obvious example of acircadian rhythm, but we also have daily fluctuations in heart rate, blood pressure, blood sugar, and bodytemperature. Some circadian rhythms play a role in changes in our state of consciousness.If we have biological rhythms, then is there some sort of biological clock? In the brain, the hypothalamus,which lies above the pituitary gland, is a main center of homeostasis. Homeostasis is the tendency to maintaina balance, or optimal level, within a biological system.The brain\u2019s clock mechanism is located in an area of the hypothalamus known as the suprachiasmaticnucleus (SCN). The axons of light-sensitive neurons in the retina provide information to the SCN based on theamount of light present, allowing this internal clock to be synchronized with the outside world (Klein, Moore, &Reppert, 1991; Welsh, Takahashi, & Kay, 2010) (Figure 4.3).FIGURE 4.3 The suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) serves as the brain\u2019s clock mechanism. The clock sets itself withlight information received through projections from the retina.Problems With Circadian RhythmsGenerally, and for most people, our circadian cycles are aligned with the outside world. For example, mostpeople sleep during the night and are awake during the day. One important regulator of sleep-wake cycles isthe hormone melatonin. The pineal gland, an endocrine structure located inside the brain that releasesmelatonin, is thought to be involved in the regulation of various biological rhythms and of the immune systemduring sleep (Hardeland, Pandi-Perumal, & Cardinali, 2006). Melatonin release is stimulated by darkness andinhibited by light.There are individual differences in regard to our sleep-wake cycle. For instance, some people would say theyare morning people, while others would consider themselves to be night owls. These individual differences incircadian patterns of activity are known as a person\u2019s chronotype, and research demonstrates that morninglarks and night owls differ with regard to sleep regulation (Taillard, Philip, Coste, Sagaspe, & Bioulac, 2003).Sleep regulation refers to the brain\u2019s control of switching between sleep and wakefulness as well ascoordinating this cycle with the outside world.LINK TO LEARNINGWatch this brief video about circadian rhythms and how they affect sleep (http://openstax.org/l/circadian) tolearn more."

One way that this happens involves traveling across multiple timezones. When we do this, we often experience jet lag. Jet lag is a collection of symptoms that results from themismatch between our internal circadian cycles and our environment. These symptoms include fatigue,sluggishness, irritability, and insomnia (i.e., a consistent difficulty in falling or staying asleep for at least threenights a week over a month\u2019s time) (Roth, 2007).Individuals who do rotating shift work are also likely to experience disruptions in circadian cycles. Rotatingshift work refers to a work schedule that changes from early to late on a daily or weekly basis. For example, aperson may work from 7:00 a.m. to 3:00 p.m. on Monday, 3:00 a.m. to 11:00 a.m. on Tuesday, and 11:00 a.m. to7:00 p.m. on Wednesday. In such instances, the individual\u2019s schedule changes so frequently that it becomesdifficult for a normal circadian rhythm to be maintained. This often results in sleeping problems, and it canlead to signs of depression and anxiety. These kinds of schedules are common for individuals working inhealth care professions and service industries, and they are associated with persistent feelings of exhaustionand agitation that can make someone more prone to making mistakes on the job (Gold et al., 1992; Presser,1995).Rotating shift work has pervasive effects on the lives and experiences of individuals engaged in that kind ofwork, which is clearly illustrated in stories reported in a qualitative study that researched the experiences ofmiddle-aged nurses who worked rotating shifts (West, Boughton & Byrnes, 2009). Several of the nursesinterviewed commented that their work schedules affected their relationships with their family. One of thenurses said,If you\u2019ve had a partner who does work regular job 9 to 5 office hours . . . the ability to spend time, goodtime with them when you\u2019re not feeling absolutely exhausted . . . that would be one of the problemsthat I\u2019ve encountered. (West et al., 2009, p. 114)While disruptions in circadian rhythms can have negative consequences, there are things we can do to help usrealign our biological clocks with the external environment. Some of these approaches, such as using a brightlight as shown in Figure 4.4, have been shown to alleviate some of the problems experienced by individualssuffering from jet lag or from the consequences of rotating shift work. Because the biological clock is driven bylight, exposure to bright light during working shifts and dark exposure when not working can help combatinsomnia and symptoms of anxiety and depression (Huang, Tsai, Chen, & Hsu, 2013).FIGURE 4.4 Devices like this are designed to provide exposure to bright light to help people maintain a regularcircadian cycle.

A person with a sleep debt does not get sufficient sleep on a chronic basis. The consequences ofsleep debt include decreased levels of alertness and mental efficiency. Interestingly, since the advent ofelectric light, the amount of sleep that people get has declined. While we certainly welcome the convenience ofhaving the darkness lit up, we also suffer the consequences of reduced amounts of sleep because we are moreactive during the nighttime hours than our ancestors were. As a result, many of us sleep less than 7\u20138 hours anight and accrue a sleep debt. While there is tremendous variation in any given individual\u2019s sleep needs, theNational Sleep Foundation (n.d.) cites research to estimate that newborns require the most sleep (between 12and 18 hours a night) and that this amount declines to just 7\u20139 hours by the time we are adults.If you lie down to take a nap and fall asleep very easily, chances are you may have sleep debt. Given that collegestudents are notorious for suffering from significant sleep debt (Hicks, Fernandez, & Pellegrini, 2001; Hicks,Johnson, & Pellegrini, 1992; Miller, Shattuck, & Matsangas, 2010), chances are you and your classmates dealwith sleep debt-related issues on a regular basis.

These effects can occur as a functionof accumulated sleep debt or in response to more acute periods of sleep deprivation. It may surprise you toknow that sleep deprivation is associated with obesity, increased blood pressure, increased levels of stresshormones, and reduced immune functioning (Banks & Dinges, 2007). A sleep deprived individual generallywill fall asleep more quickly than if they were not sleep deprived. Some sleep-deprived individuals havedifficulty staying awake when they stop moving (example sitting and watching television or driving a car). Thatis why individuals suffering from sleep deprivation can also put themselves and others at risk when they putthemselves behind the wheel of a car or work with dangerous machinery. Some research suggests that sleepdeprivation affects cognitive and motor function as much as, if not more than, alcohol intoxication (Williamson& Feyer, 2000). Research shows that the most severe effects of sleep deprivation occur when a person staysawake for more than 24 hours (Killgore & Weber, 2014; Killgore et al., 2007), or following repeated nights withfewer than four hours in bed (Wickens, Hutchins, Lauk, Seebook, 2015). For example, irritability, distractibility,and impairments in cognitive and moral judgment can occur with fewer than four hours of sleep. If someonestays awake for 48 consecutive hours, they could start to hallucinate.FIGURE 4.5 This figure illustrates some of the negative consequences of sleep deprivation. While cognitive deficitsmay be the most obvious, many body systems are negatively impacted by lack of sleep.

Some animals never sleep (e.g., some fish and amphibian species); other animals sleep verylittle without apparent negative consequences (e.g., giraffes); yet some animals (e.g., rats) die after two weeksof sleep deprivation (Siegel, 2008). Why do we devote so much time to sleeping? Is it absolutely essential thatwe sleep? This section will consider these questions and explore various explanations for why we sleep.What is Sleep?You have read that sleep is distinguished by low levels of physical activity and reduced sensory awareness. Asdiscussed by Siegel (2008), a definition of sleep must also include mention of the interplay of the circadian andhomeostatic mechanisms that regulate sleep. Homeostatic regulation of sleep is evidenced by sleep reboundfollowing sleep deprivation. Sleep rebound refers to the fact that a sleep-deprived individual will fall asleepmore quickly during subsequent opportunities for sleep. Sleep is characterized by certain patterns of activityof the brain that can be visualized using electroencephalography (EEG), and different phases of sleep can bedifferentiated using EEG as well.Sleep-wake cycles seem to be controlled by multiple brain areas acting in conjunction with one another. Someof these areas include the thalamus, the hypothalamus, and the pons. As already mentioned, thehypothalamus contains the SCN\u2014the biological clock of the body\u2014in addition to other nuclei that, inconjunction with the thalamus, regulate slow-wave sleep. The pons is important for regulating rapid eyemovement (REM) sleep (National Institutes of Health, n.d.).Sleep is also associated with the secretion and regulation of a number of hormones from several endocrineglands including: melatonin, follicle stimulating hormone (FSH), luteinizing hormone (LH), and growthhormone (National Institutes of Health, n.d.). You have read that the pineal gland releases melatonin duringsleep (Figure 4.6). Melatonin is thought to be involved in the regulation of various biological rhythms and theimmune system (Hardeland et al., 2006). During sleep, the pituitary gland secretes both FSH and LH which areimportant in regulating the reproductive system (Christensen et al., 2012; Sofikitis et al., 2008). The pituitarygland also secretes growth hormone, during sleep, which plays a role in physical growth and maturation aswell as other metabolic processes (Bartke, Sun, & Longo, 2013).FIGURE 4.6 The pineal and pituitary glands secrete a number of hormones during sleep.Why Do We Sleep?Given the central role that sleep plays in our lives and the number of adverse consequences that have beenassociated with sleep deprivation, one would think that we would have a clear understanding of why it is thatwe sleep. Unfortunately, this is not the case; however, several hypotheses have been proposed to explain thefunction of sleep."

        "data": "Page 116116 4 \u2022 States of ConsciousnessAdaptive Function of SleepOne popular hypothesis of sleep incorporates the perspective of evolutionary psychology. Evolutionarypsychology is a discipline that studies how universal patterns of behavior and cognitive processes haveevolved over time as a result of natural selection. Variations and adaptations in cognition and behavior makeindividuals more or less successful in reproducing and passing their genes to their offspring. One hypothesisfrom this perspective might argue that sleep is essential to restore resources that are expended during the day.Just as bears hibernate in the winter when resources are scarce, perhaps people sleep at night to reduce theirenergy expenditures. While this is an intuitive explanation of sleep, there is little research that supports thisexplanation. In fact, it has been suggested that there is no reason to think that energetic demands could not beaddressed with periods of rest and inactivity (Frank, 2006; Rial et al., 2007), and some research has actuallyfound a negative correlation between energetic demands and the amount of time spent sleeping (Capellini,Barton, McNamara, Preston, & Nunn, 2008).Another evolutionary hypothesis of sleep holds that our sleep patterns evolved as an adaptive response topredatory risks, which increase in darkness. Thus we sleep in safe areas to reduce the chance of harm. Again,this is an intuitive and appealing explanation for why we sleep. Perhaps our ancestors spent extended periodsof time asleep to reduce attention to themselves from potential predators. Comparative research indicates,however, that the relationship that exists between predatory risk and sleep is very complex and equivocal.Some research suggests that species that face higher predatory risks sleep fewer hours than other species(Capellini et al., 2008), while other researchers suggest there is no relationship between the amount of time agiven species spends in deep sleep and its predation risk (Lesku, Roth, Amlaner, & Lima, 2006).It is quite possible that sleep serves no single universally adaptive function, and different species have evolveddifferent patterns of sleep in response to their unique evolutionary pressures. While we have discussed thenegative outcomes associated with sleep deprivation, it should be pointed out that there are many benefits thatare associated with adequate amounts of sleep. A few such benefits listed by the National Sleep Foundation(n.d.) include maintaining healthy weight, lowering stress levels, improving mood, and increasing motorcoordination, as well as a number of benefits related to cognition and memory formation.Cognitive Function of SleepAnother theory regarding why we sleep involves sleep\u2019s importance for cognitive function and memoryformation (Rattenborg, Lesku, Martinez-Gonzalez, & Lima, 2007). Indeed, we know sleep deprivation results indisruptions in cognition and memory deficits (Brown, 2012), leading to impairments in our abilities tomaintain attention, make decisions, and recall long-term memories. Moreover, these impairments becomemore severe as the amount of sleep deprivation increases (Alhola & Polo-Kantola, 2007). Furthermore, slow-wave sleep after learning a new task can improve resultant performance on that task (Huber, Ghilardi,Massimini, & Tononi, 2004) and seems essential for effective memory formation (Stickgold, 2005).Understanding the impact of sleep on cognitive function should help you understand that cramming all nightfor a test may be not effective and can even prove counterproductive.LINK TO LEARNINGWatch this brief video that gives sleep tips for college students (http://openstax.org/l/sleeptips) to learn more.Getting the optimal amount of sleep has also been associated with other cognitive benefits. Research indicatesthat included among these possible benefits are increased capacities for creative thinking (Cai, Mednick,Harrison, Kanady, & Mednick, 2009; Wagner, Gais, Haider, Verleger, & Born, 2004), language learning (Fenn,Nusbaum, & Margoliash, 2003; G\u00f3mez, Bootzin, & Nadel, 2006), and inferential judgments (Ellenbogen, Hu,Payne, Titone, & Walker, 2007). It is possible that even the processing of emotional information is influenced bycertain aspects of sleep (Walker, 2009)."

Instead, sleep is composed of several different stages that can bedifferentiated from one another by the patterns of brain wave activity that occur during each stage. Whileawake, our brain wave activity is dominated by beta waves. As compared to the brain wave patterns whileasleep, beta waves have the highest frequency (13\u201330 Hz) and lowest amplitude, and they tend to show morevariability. As we begin to fall asleep, our brain wave activity changes. These changes can be visualized usingan EEG and are distinguished from one another by both the frequency and amplitude of the brain wave. Thefrequency of a brain wave is how many brain waves occur in a second, and frequency is measured in Hertz(Hz). Amplitude is the height of the brain wave (Figure 4.7). Sleep can be divided into two different generalphases: REM sleep and non-REM (NREM) sleep. Rapid eye movement (REM) sleep is characterized by dartingmovements of the eyes under closed eyelids. Brain waves during REM sleep appear very similar to brain wavesduring wakefulness. In contrast, non-REM (NREM) sleep is subdivided into three stages distinguished fromeach other and from wakefulness by characteristic patterns of brain waves. The first three stages of sleep areNREM sleep, typically followed by REM sleep. In this section, we will discuss each of these stages of sleep andtheir associated patterns of brain wave activity.FIGURE 4.7 Brainwave activity changes dramatically across the different stages of sleep.

The early portion ofstage 1 sleep produces alpha waves. These patterns of electrical activity (waves) resemble that of someonewho is very relaxed, yet awake, but they have less variability (are more synchronized) and are relatively lowerin frequency (8\u201312 Hz) and higher in amplitude than beta waves (Figure 4.8). As an individual continuesthrough stage 1 sleep, there is an increase in theta wave activity. Theta waves are even lower frequency (4\u20137Hz), and higher in amplitude, than the alpha wave patterns. It is relatively easy to wake someone from stage 1sleep; in fact, people often report that they have not been asleep if they are awoken during stage 1 sleep.FIGURE 4.8 Brainwave activity changes dramatically across the different stages of sleep.As we move into stage 2 sleep, the body goes into a state of deep relaxation. Theta waves still dominate theactivity of the brain, but they are interrupted by brief bursts of activity known as sleep spindles (Figure 4.9). Asleep spindle is a rapid burst of higher frequency brain waves that may be important for learning and memory(Fogel & Smith, 2011; Poe, Walsh, & Bjorness, 2010). In addition, the appearance of K-complexes is oftenassociated with stage 2 sleep. A K-complex is a very high amplitude pattern of brain activity that may in somecases occur in response to environmental stimuli. Thus, K-complexes might serve as a bridge to higher levelsof arousal in response to what is going on in our environments (Hal\u00e1sz, 1993; Steriade & Amzica, 1998).FIGURE 4.9 Stage 2 sleep is characterized by the appearance of both sleep spindles and K-complexes.NREM stage 3 sleep is often referred to as deep sleep or slow-wave sleep because this stage is characterized bylow frequency (less than 3 Hz), high amplitude delta waves (Figure 4.10). These delta waves have the lowestfrequency and highest amplitude of our sleeping brain wave patterns.

It is also associated with paralysis of muscle systems in thebody with the exception of those that make circulation and respiration possible. Therefore, no movement ofvoluntary muscles occurs during REM sleep in a normal individual; REM sleep is often referred to asparadoxical sleep because of this combination of high brain activity and lack of muscle tone.

By the late 19thcentury, Austrian psychiatrist Sigmund Freud had become convinced that dreams represented an opportunityto gain access to the unconscious. By analyzing dreams, Freud thought people could increase self-awarenessand gain valuable insight to help them deal with the problems they faced in their lives. Freud madedistinctions between the manifest content and the latent content of dreams. Manifest content is the actualcontent, or storyline, of a dream. Latent content, on the other hand, refers to the hidden meaning of a dream.For instance, if a woman dreams about being chased by a snake, Freud might have argued that this representsthe woman\u2019s fear of sexual intimacy, with the snake serving as a symbol of a man\u2019s penis.Freud was not the only theorist to focus on the content of dreams. The 20th century Swiss psychiatrist CarlJung believed that dreams allowed us to tap into the collective unconscious. The collective unconscious, asdescribed by Jung, is a theoretical repository of information he believed to be shared by everyone. Accordingto Jung, certain symbols in dreams reflected universal archetypes with meanings that are similar for all peopleregardless of culture or location.The sleep and dreaming researcher Rosalind Cartwright, however, believes that dreams simply reflect lifeevents that are important to the dreamer. Unlike Freud and Jung, Cartwright\u2019s ideas about dreaming havefound empirical support. For example, she and her colleagues published a study in which women goingthrough divorce were asked several times over a five month period to report the degree to which their formerspouses were on their minds. These same women were awakened during REM sleep in order to provide adetailed account of their dream content. There was a significant positive correlation between the degree towhich women thought about their former spouses during waking hours and the number of times their formerspouses appeared as characters in their dreams (Cartwright, Agargun, Kirkby, & Friedman, 2006). Recentresearch (Horikawa, Tamaki, Miyawaki, & Kamitani, 2013) has uncovered new techniques by which"

Earlyversions of this theory proposed that dreams were not the meaning-filled representations of angst proposed byFreud and others, but were rather the result of our brain attempting to make sense of (\"synthesize\") the neuralactivity (\"activation\") that was happening during REM sleep. Recent adaptations (e.g., Hobson, 2002) continueto update the theory based on accumulating evidence. For example, Hobson (2009) suggests that dreamingmay represent a state of protoconsciousness. In other words, dreaming involves constructing a virtual realityin our heads that we might use to help us during wakefulness. Among a variety of neurobiological evidence,John Hobson cites research on lucid dreams as an opportunity to better understand dreaming in general.Lucid dreams are dreams in which certain aspects of wakefulness are maintained during a dream state. In alucid dream, a person becomes aware of the fact that they are dreaming, and as such, they can control thedream\u2019s content (LaBerge, 1990)."

This section will describe several sleep disorders as well as some of theirtreatment options.InsomniaInsomnia, a consistent difficulty in falling or staying asleep, is the most common of the sleep disorders.Individuals with insomnia often experience long delays between the times that they go to bed and actually fallasleep. In addition, these individuals may wake up several times during the night only to find that they havedifficulty getting back to sleep. As mentioned earlier, one of the criteria for insomnia involves experiencingthese symptoms for at least three nights a week for at least one month\u2019s time (Roth, 2007).It is not uncommon for people suffering from insomnia to experience increased levels of anxiety about theirinability to fall asleep. This becomes a self-perpetuating cycle because increased anxiety leads to increasedarousal, and higher levels of arousal make the prospect of falling asleep even more unlikely. Chronic insomniais almost always associated with feeling overtired and may be associated with symptoms of depression.There may be many factors that contribute to insomnia, including age, drug use, exercise, mental status, andbedtime routines. Not surprisingly, insomnia treatment may take one of several different approaches. Peoplewho suffer from insomnia might limit their use of stimulant drugs (such as caffeine) or increase their amountof physical exercise during the day. Some people might turn to over-the-counter (OTC) or prescribed sleepmedications to help them sleep, but this should be done sparingly because many sleep medications result independence and alter the nature of the sleep cycle, and they can increase insomnia over time. Those whocontinue to have insomnia, particularly if it affects their quality of life, should seek professional treatment.Some forms of psychotherapy, such as cognitive-behavioral therapy, can help sufferers of insomnia.Cognitive-behavioral therapy is a type of psychotherapy that focuses on cognitive processes and problem"

The treatment of insomnia likely would include stress management techniques and changes inproblematic behaviors that could contribute to insomnia (e.g., spending more waking time in bed). Cognitive-behavioral therapy has been demonstrated to be quite effective in treating insomnia (Savard, Simard, Ivers, &Morin, 2005; Williams, Roth, Vatthauer, & McCrae, 2013).EVERYDAY CONNECTIONSolutions to Support Healthy SleepHas something like this ever happened to you? My sophomore college housemate got so stressed out duringfinals sophomore year he drank almost a whole bottle of Nyquil to try to fall asleep. When he told me, I made himgo see the college therapist.Many college students struggle getting the recommended 7\u20139 hours of sleep each night. However, for some, it'snot because of all-night partying or late-night study sessions. It's simply that they feel so overwhelmed andstressed that they cannot fall asleep or stay asleep. One or two nights of sleep difficulty is not unusual, but if youexperience anything more than that, you should seek a doctor's advice.Here are some tips to maintain healthy sleep:\u2022 Stick to a sleep schedule, even on the weekends. Try going to bed and waking up at the same time every dayto keep your biological clock in sync so your body gets in the habit of sleeping every night.\u2022 Avoid anything stimulating for an hour before bed. That includes exercise and bright light from devices.\u2022 Exercise daily.\u2022 Avoid naps.\u2022 Keep your bedroom temperature between 60 and 67 degrees. People sleep better in cooler temperatures.\u2022 Avoid alcohol, cigarettes, caffeine, and heavy meals before bed. It may feel like alcohol helps you sleep, but\u2022it actually disrupts REM sleep and leads to frequent awakenings. Heavy meals may make you sleepy, butthey can also lead to frequent awakenings due to gastric distress.If you cannot fall asleep, leave your bed and do something else until you feel tired again. Train your body toassociate the bed with sleeping rather than other activities like studying, eating, or watching televisionshows.ParasomniasA parasomnia is one of a group of sleep disorders in which unwanted, disruptive motor activity and/orexperiences during sleep play a role. Parasomnias can occur in either REM or NREM phases of sleep.Sleepwalking, restless leg syndrome, and night terrors are all examples of parasomnias (Mahowald & Schenck,2000).SleepwalkingIn sleepwalking, or somnambulism, the sleeper engages in relatively complex behaviors ranging fromwandering about to driving an automobile. During periods of sleepwalking, sleepers often have their eyesopen, but they are not responsive to attempts to communicate with them. Sleepwalking most often occursduring slow-wave sleep, but it can occur at any time during a sleep period in some affected individuals(Mahowald & Schenck, 2000).Historically, somnambulism has been treated with a variety of pharmacotherapies ranging frombenzodiazepines to antidepressants. However, the success rate of such treatments is questionable.Guilleminault et al. (2005) found that sleepwalking was not alleviated with the use of benzodiazepines.However, all of their somnambulistic patients who also suffered from sleep-related breathing problemsshowed a marked decrease in sleepwalking when their breathing problems were effectively treated."

After dinner, he prepared some materials to use in leading a churchyouth group the following morning, and then he attempted to repair the family\u2019s swimming pool pump beforeretiring to bed. The following morning, he awoke to barking dogs and unfamiliar voices from downstairs. As hewent to investigate what was going on, he was met by a group of police officers who arrested him for the murderof his wife (Cartwright, 2004; CNN, 1999).Yarmila Falater\u2019s body was found in the family\u2019s pool with 44 stab wounds. A neighbor called the police afterwitnessing Falater standing over his wife\u2019s body before dragging her into the pool. Upon a search of the premises,police found blood-stained clothes and a bloody knife in the trunk of Falater\u2019s car, and he had blood stains on hisneck.Remarkably, Falater insisted that he had no recollection of hurting his wife in any way. His children and his wife\u2019sparents all agreed that Falater had an excellent relationship with his wife and they couldn\u2019t think of a reason thatwould provide any sort of motive to murder her (Cartwright, 2004).Scott Falater had a history of regular episodes of sleepwalking as a child, and he had even behaved violentlytoward his sister once when she tried to prevent him from leaving their home in his pajamas during asleepwalking episode. He suffered from no apparent anatomical brain anomalies or psychological disorders. Itappeared that Scott Falater had killed his wife in his sleep, or at least, that is the defense he used when he wastried for his wife\u2019s murder (Cartwright, 2004; CNN, 1999). In Falater\u2019s case, a jury found him guilty of first degreemurder in June of 1999 (CNN, 1999); however, there are other murder cases where the sleepwalking defensehas been used successfully. As scary as it sounds, many sleep researchers believe that homicidal sleepwalking ispossible in individuals suffering from the types of sleep disorders described below (Broughton et al., 1994;Cartwright, 2004; Mahowald, Schenck, & Cramer Bornemann, 2005; Pressman, 2007).REM Sleep Behavior Disorder (RBD)REM sleep behavior disorder (RBD) occurs when the muscle paralysis associated with the REM sleep phasedoes not occur. Individuals who suffer from RBD have high levels of physical activity during REM sleep,especially during disturbing dreams. These behaviors vary widely, but they can include kicking, punching,scratching, yelling, and behaving like an animal that has been frightened or attacked. People who suffer fromthis disorder can injure themselves or their sleeping partners when engaging in these behaviors. Furthermore,these types of behaviors ultimately disrupt sleep, although affected individuals have no memories that thesebehaviors have occurred (Arnulf, 2012).This disorder is associated with a number of neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinson\u2019s disease. In fact,this relationship is so robust that some view the presence of RBD as a potential aid in the diagnosis andtreatment of a number of neurodegenerative diseases (Ferini-Strambi, 2011). Clonazepam, an anti-anxietymedication with sedative properties, is most often used to treat RBD. It is administered alone or in conjunctionwith doses of melatonin (the hormone secreted by the pineal gland). As part of treatment, the sleepingenvironment is often modified to make it a safer place for those suffering from RBD (Zangini, Calandra-Buonaura, Grimaldi, & Cortelli, 2011).Other ParasomniasA person with restless leg syndrome has uncomfortable sensations in the legs during periods of inactivity orwhen trying to fall asleep. This discomfort is relieved by deliberately moving the legs, which, not surprisingly,contributes to difficulty in falling or staying asleep. Restless leg syndrome is quite common and has been"

There are a variety of drugs that treat restless leg syndrome: benzodiazepines, opiates, andanticonvulsants (Restless Legs Syndrome Foundation, n.d.).Night terrors result in a sense of panic in the sufferer and are often accompanied by screams and attempts toescape from the immediate environment (Mahowald & Schenck, 2000). Although individuals suffering fromnight terrors appear to be awake, they generally have no memories of the events that occurred, and attempts toconsole them are ineffective. Typically, individuals suffering from night terrors will fall back asleep againwithin a short time. Night terrors apparently occur during the NREM phase of sleep (Provini, Tinuper, Bisulli, &Lagaresi, 2011). Generally, treatment for night terrors is unnecessary unless there is some underlying medicalor psychological condition that is contributing to the night terrors (Mayo Clinic, n.d.).Sleep ApneaSleep apnea is defined by episodes during which a sleeper\u2019s breathing stops. These episodes can last 10\u201320seconds or longer and often are associated with brief periods of arousal. While individuals suffering from sleepapnea may not be aware of these repeated disruptions in sleep, they do experience increased levels of fatigue.Many individuals diagnosed with sleep apnea first seek treatment because their sleeping partners indicatethat they snore loudly and/or stop breathing for extended periods of time while sleeping (Henry & Rosenthal,2013). Sleep apnea is much more common in overweight people and is often associated with loud snoring.Surprisingly, sleep apnea may exacerbate cardiovascular disease (S\u00e1nchez-de-la-Torre, Campos-Rodriguez, &Barb\u00e9, 2012). While sleep apnea is less common in thin people, anyone, regardless of their weight, who snoresloudly or gasps for air while sleeping, should be checked for sleep apnea.While people are often unaware of their sleep apnea, they are keenly aware of some of the adverseconsequences of insufficient sleep. Consider a patient who believed that as a result of his sleep apnea he \u201chadthree car accidents in six weeks. They were ALL my fault. Two of them I didn\u2019t even know I was involved inuntil afterwards\u201d (Henry & Rosenthal, 2013, p. 52). It is not uncommon for people suffering from undiagnosedor untreated sleep apnea to fear that their careers will be affected by the lack of sleep, illustrated by thisstatement from another patient, \u201cI\u2019m in a job where there\u2019s a premium on being mentally alert. I was reallysleepy\u2026 and having trouble concentrating\u2026. It was getting to the point where it was kind of scary\u201d (Henry &Rosenthal, 2013, p. 52).There are two types of sleep apnea: obstructive sleep apnea and central sleep apnea. Obstructive sleep apneaoccurs when an individual\u2019s airway becomes blocked during sleep, and air is prevented from entering thelungs. In central sleep apnea, disruption in signals sent from the brain that regulate breathing cause periodsof interrupted breathing (White, 2005).One of the most common treatments for sleep apnea involves the use of a special device during sleep. Acontinuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) device includes a mask that fits over the sleeper\u2019s nose andmouth, which is connected to a pump that pumps air into the person\u2019s airways, forcing them to remain open,as shown in Figure 4.13. Some newer CPAP masks are smaller and cover only the nose. This treatment optionhas proven to be effective for people suffering from mild to severe cases of sleep apnea (McDaid et al., 2009).However, alternative treatment options are being explored because consistent compliance by users of CPAPdevices is a problem. Recently, a new EPAP (expiratory positive air pressure) device has shown promise indouble-blind trials as one such alternative (Berry, Kryger, & Massie, 2011)."

Infants youngerthan 12 months appear to be at the highest risk for SIDS, and boys have a greater risk than girls. A number ofrisk factors have been associated with SIDS including premature birth, smoking within the home, andhyperthermia. There may also be differences in both brain structure and function in infants that die from SIDS(Berkowitz, 2012; Mage & Donner, 2006; Thach, 2005).The substantial amount of research on SIDS has led to a number of recommendations to parents to protecttheir children (Figure 4.14). For one, research suggests that infants should be placed on their backs when putdown to sleep, and their cribs should not contain any items which pose suffocation threats, such as blankets,pillows or padded crib bumpers (cushions that cover the bars of a crib). Infants should not have caps placed ontheir heads when put down to sleep in order to prevent overheating, and people in the child\u2019s household shouldabstain from smoking in the home. Recommendations like these have helped to decrease the number of infantdeaths from SIDS in recent years (Mitchell, 2009; Task Force on Sudden Infant Death Syndrome, 2011).FIGURE 4.14 The Safe to Sleep campaign educates the public about how to minimize risk factors associated withSIDS. This campaign is sponsored in part by the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development.NarcolepsyUnlike the other sleep disorders described in this section, a person with narcolepsy cannot resist fallingasleep at inopportune times. These sleep episodes are often associated with cataplexy, which is a lack ofmuscle tone or muscle weakness, and in some cases involves complete paralysis of the voluntary muscles.This is similar to the kind of paralysis experienced by healthy individuals during REM sleep (Burgess &Scammell, 2012; Hishikawa & Shimizu, 1995; Luppi et al., 2011). Narcoleptic episodes take on other featuresof REM sleep. For example, around one third of individuals diagnosed with narcolepsy experience vivid,dream-like hallucinations during narcoleptic attacks (Chokroverty, 2010).Surprisingly, narcoleptic episodes are often triggered by states of heightened arousal or stress. The typicalepisode can last from a minute or two to half an hour. Once awakened from a narcoleptic attack, people reportthat they feel refreshed (Chokroverty, 2010). Obviously, regular narcoleptic episodes could interfere with theability to perform one\u2019s job or complete schoolwork, and in some situations, narcolepsy can result insignificant harm and injury (e.g., driving a car or operating machinery or other potentially dangerousequipment)."

        "data": "Page 126126 4 \u2022 States of ConsciousnessGenerally, narcolepsy is treated using psychomotor stimulant drugs, such as amphetamines (Mignot, 2012).These drugs promote increased levels of neural activity. Narcolepsy is associated with reduced levels of thesignaling molecule hypocretin in some areas of the brain (De la Herr\u00e1n-Arita & Drucker-Col\u00edn, 2012; Han,2012), and the traditional stimulant drugs do not have direct effects on this system. Therefore, it is quite likelythat new medications that are developed to treat narcolepsy will be designed to target the hypocretin system.There is a tremendous amount of variability among sufferers, both in terms of how symptoms of narcolepsymanifest and the effectiveness of currently available treatment options. This is illustrated by McCarty\u2019s (2010)case study of a 50-year-old woman who sought help for the excessive sleepiness during normal waking hoursthat she had experienced for several years. She indicated that she had fallen asleep at inappropriate ordangerous times, including while eating, while socializing with friends, and while driving her car. Duringperiods of emotional arousal, the woman complained that she felt some weakness in the right side of her body.Although she did not experience any dream-like hallucinations, she was diagnosed with narcolepsy as a resultof sleep testing. In her case, the fact that her cataplexy was confined to the right side of her body was quiteunusual. Early attempts to treat her condition with a stimulant drug alone were unsuccessful. However, when astimulant drug was used in conjunction with a popular antidepressant, her condition improved dramatically."

This section will presentinformation relating to the use of various psychoactive drugs and problems associated with such use. This willbe followed by brief descriptions of the effects of some of the more well-known drugs commonly used today.Substance Use DisordersThe fifth edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition(DSM-5) is used byclinicians to diagnose individuals suffering from various psychological disorders. Drug use disorders areaddictive disorders, and the criteria for specific substance (drug) use disorders are described in DSM-5. Aperson who has a substance use disorder often uses more of the substance than they originally intended to andcontinues to use that substance despite experiencing significant adverse consequences. In individualsdiagnosed with a substance use disorder, there is a compulsive pattern of drug use that is often associated withboth physical and psychological dependence.Physical dependence involves changes in normal bodily functions\u2014the user will experience withdrawal fromthe drug upon cessation of use. In contrast, a person who has psychological dependence has an emotional,rather than physical, need for the drug and may use the drug to relieve psychological distress. Tolerance islinked to physiological dependence, and it occurs when a person requires more and more drug to achieveeffects previously experienced at lower doses. Tolerance can cause the user to increase the amount of drugused to a dangerous level\u2014even to the point of overdose and death.Drug withdrawal includes a variety of negative symptoms experienced when drug use is discontinued. Thesesymptoms usually are opposite of the effects of the drug. For example, withdrawal from sedative drugs oftenproduces unpleasant arousal and agitation. In addition to withdrawal, many individuals who are diagnosedwith substance use disorders will also develop tolerance to these substances. Psychological dependence, ordrug craving, is a recent addition to the diagnostic criteria for substance use disorder in DSM-5. This is animportant factor because we can develop tolerance and experience withdrawal from any number of drugs thatwe do not abuse. In other words, physical dependence in and of itself is of limited utility in determining"

Other depressantsinclude barbiturates and benzodiazepines. These drugs share in common their ability to serve as agonists ofthe gamma-Aminobutyric acid (GABA) neurotransmitter system. Because GABA has a quieting effect on thebrain, GABA agonists also have a quieting effect; these types of drugs are often prescribed to treat both anxietyand insomnia.FIGURE 4.15 The GABA-gated chloride (Cl\u2013) channel is embedded in the cell membrane of certain neurons. Thechannel has multiple receptor sites where alcohol, barbiturates, and benzodiazepines bind to exert their effects. Thebinding of these molecules opens the chloride channel, allowing negatively-charged chloride ions (Cl\u2013) into theneuron's cell body. Changing its charge in a negative direction pushes the neuron awayfrom firing; thus, activating aGABA neuron has a quieting effect on the brain.Acute alcohol administration results in a variety of changes to consciousness. At rather low doses, alcohol useis associated with feelings of euphoria. As the dose increases, people report feeling sedated. Generally, alcoholis associated with decreases in reaction time and visual acuity, lowered levels of alertness, and reduction inbehavioral control. With excessive alcohol use, a person might experience a complete loss of consciousnessand/or difficulty remembering events that occurred during a period of intoxication (McKim & Hancock, 2013).In addition, if a pregnant person consumes alcohol, their infant may be born with a cluster of birth defects andsymptoms collectively called fetal alcohol spectrum disorder (FASD) or fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS).With repeated use of many central nervous system depressants, such as alcohol, a person becomes physicallydependent upon the substance and will exhibit signs of both tolerance and withdrawal. Psychologicaldependence on these drugs is also possible. Therefore, the abuse potential of central nervous systemdepressants is relatively high.Drug withdrawal is usually an aversive experience, and it can be a life-threatening process in individuals whohave a long history of very high doses of alcohol and/or barbiturates. This is of such concern that people whoare trying to overcome addiction to these substances should only do so under medical supervision."

Many of these drugs act as agonistsof the dopamine neurotransmitter system. Dopamine activity is often associated with reward and craving;therefore, drugs that affect dopamine neurotransmission often have abuse liability. Drugs in this categoryinclude cocaine, amphetamines (including methamphetamine), cathinones (i.e., bath salts), MDMA (ecstasy),nicotine, and caffeine.Cocaine can be taken in multiple ways. While many users snort cocaine, intravenous injection and inhalation(smoking) are also common. The freebase version of cocaine, known as crack, is a potent, smokable version ofthe drug. Like many other stimulants, cocaine agonizes the dopamine neurotransmitter system by blockingthe reuptake of dopamine in the neuronal synapse.DIG DEEPERMethamphetamineMethamphetamine in its smokable form, often called \u201ccrystal meth\u201d due to its resemblance to rock crystalformations, is highly addictive. The smokable form reaches the brain very quickly to produce an intense euphoriathat dissipates almost as fast as it arrives, prompting users to continuing taking the drug. Users often consumethe drug every few hours across days-long binges called \"runs,\" in which the user forgoes food and sleep. Theavailability of potent and inexpensive forms of methamphetamine, coupled with a lower risk of overdose thanwith opiate drugs, is making crystal meth a popular choice among drug users today (NIDA, 2019). Using crystalmeth poses a number of serious long-term health issues, including dental problems (often called \"meth mouth\"),skin abrasions caused by excessive scratching, memory loss, sleep problems, violent behavior, paranoia, andhallucinations. Methamphetamine addiction produces an intense craving that is difficult to treat.Amphetamines have a mechanism of action quite similar to cocaine in that they block the reuptake ofdopamine in addition to stimulating its release (Figure 4.16). While amphetamines are often abused, they arealso commonly prescribed to people diagnosed with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). It mayseem counterintuitive that stimulant medications are prescribed to treat a disorder that involves hyperactivity,but the therapeutic effect comes from increases in neurotransmitter activity within certain areas of the brainassociated with impulse control. These brain areas include the prefrontal cortex and basal ganglia."

Methamphetamine is atype of amphetamine that can be made from ingredients that are readily available (e.g., medicationscontaining pseudoephedrine, a compound found in many over-the-counter cold and flu remedies). Despiterecent changes in laws designed to make obtaining pseudoephedrine more difficult, methamphetaminecontinues to be an easily accessible and relatively inexpensive drug option (Shukla, Crump, & Chrisco, 2012).Stimulant users seek a euphoric high, feelings of intense elation and pleasure, especially in those users whotake the drug via intravenous injection or smoking. MDMA (3.4-methelynedioxy-methamphetamine,commonly known as \"ecstasy\" or \"Molly\") is a mild stimulant with perception-altering effects. It is typicallyconsumed in pill form. Users experience increased energy, feelings of pleasure, and emotional warmth.Repeated use of these stimulants can have significant adverse consequences. Users can experience physicalsymptoms that include nausea, elevated blood pressure, and increased heart rate. In addition, these drugs cancause feelings of anxiety, hallucinations, and paranoia (Fiorentini et al., 2011). Normal brain functioning isaltered after repeated use of these drugs. For example, repeated use can lead to overall depletion among themonoamine neurotransmitters (dopamine, norepinephrine, and serotonin). Depletion of certainneurotransmitters can lead to mood dysphoria, cognitive problems, and other factors. This can lead to peoplecompulsively using stimulants such as cocaine and amphetamines, in part to try to reestablish the person'sphysical and psychological pre-use baseline. (Jayanthi & Ramamoorthy, 2005; Rothman, Blough, & Baumann,2007).Caffeine is another stimulant drug. While it is probably the most commonly used drug in the world, thepotency of this particular drug pales in comparison to the other stimulant drugs described in this section.Generally, people use caffeine to maintain increased levels of alertness and arousal. Caffeine is found in manycommon medicines (such as weight loss drugs), beverages, foods, and even cosmetics (Herman & Herman,2013). While caffeine may have some indirect effects on dopamine neurotransmission, its primarymechanism of action involves antagonizing adenosine activity (Porkka-Heiskanen, 2011). Adenosine is a"

Caffeine is an adenosine antagonist, so caffeine inhibits the adenosinereceptors, thus decreasing sleepiness and promoting wakefulness.While caffeine is generally considered a relatively safe drug, high blood levels of caffeine can result ininsomnia, agitation, muscle twitching, nausea, irregular heartbeat, and even death (Reissig, Strain, & Griffiths,2009; Wolt, Ganetsky, & Babu, 2012). In 2012, Kromann and Nielson reported on a case study of a 40-year-oldwoman who suffered significant ill effects from her use of caffeine. The woman used caffeine in the past toboost her mood and to provide energy, but over the course of several years, she increased her caffeineconsumption to the point that she was consuming three liters of soda each day. Although she had been taking aprescription antidepressant, her symptoms of depression continued to worsen and she began to sufferphysically, displaying significant warning signs of cardiovascular disease and diabetes. Upon admission to anoutpatient clinic for treatment of mood disorders, she met all of the diagnostic criteria for substancedependence and was advised to dramatically limit her caffeine intake. Once she was able to limit her use toless than 12 ounces of soda a day, both her mental and physical health gradually improved. Despite theprevalence of caffeine use and the large number of people who confess to suffering from caffeine addiction,this was the first published description of soda dependence appearing in scientific literature.Nicotine is highly addictive, and the use of tobacco products is associated with increased risks of heart disease,stroke, and a variety of cancers. Nicotine exerts its effects through its interaction with acetylcholine receptors.Acetylcholine functions as a neurotransmitter in motor neurons. In the central nervous system, it plays a rolein arousal and reward mechanisms. Nicotine is most commonly used in the form of tobacco products likecigarettes or chewing tobacco; therefore, there is a tremendous interest in developing effective smokingcessation techniques. To date, people have used a variety of nicotine replacement therapies in addition tovarious psychotherapeutic options in an attempt to discontinue their use of tobacco products. In general,smoking cessation programs may be effective in the short term, but it is unclear whether these effects persist(Cropley, Theadom, Pravettoni, & Webb, 2008; Levitt, Shaw, Wong, & Kaczorowski, 2007; Smedslund, Fisher,Boles, & Lichtenstein, 2004). Vaping as a means to deliver nicotine is becoming increasingly popular,especially among teens and young adults. Vaping uses battery-powered devices, sometimes called e-cigarettes,that deliver liquid nicotine and flavorings as a vapor. Originally reported as a safe alternative to the knowncancer-causing agents found in cigarettes, vaping is now known to be very dangerous and has led to seriouslung disease and death in users (Shmerling, 2019).OpioidsAn opioid is one of a category of drugs that includes heroin, morphine, methadone, and codeine. Opioids haveanalgesic properties; that is, they decrease pain. Humans have an endogenous opioid neurotransmittersystem\u2014the body makes small quantities of opioid compounds that bind to opioid receptors reducing pain andproducing euphoria. Thus, opioid drugs, which mimic this endogenous painkilling mechanism, have anextremely high potential for abuse. Natural opioids, called opiates, are derivatives of opium, which is anaturally occurring compound found in the poppy plant. There are now several synthetic versions of opiatedrugs (correctly called opioids) that have very potent painkilling effects, and they are often abused. Forexample, the National Institutes of Drug Abuse has sponsored research that suggests the misuse and abuse ofthe prescription pain killers hydrocodone and oxycodone are significant public health concerns (Maxwell,2006). In 2013, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration recommended tighter controls on their medical use.Historically, heroin has been a major opioid drug of abuse (Figure 4.17). Heroin can be snorted, smoked, orinjected intravenously. Heroin produces intense feelings of euphoria and pleasure, which are amplified whenthe heroin is injected intravenously. Following the initial \"rush,\" users experience 4\u20136 hours of \"going on thenod,\" alternating between conscious and semiconscious states. Heroin users often shoot the drug directly intotheir veins. Some people who have injected many times into their arms will show \"track marks,\" while otherusers will inject into areas between their fingers or between their toes, so as not to show obvious track marksand, like all abusers of intravenous drugs, have an increased risk for contraction of both tuberculosis and HIV."

(credit a: modification of work by Todd Huffman)Aside from their utility as analgesic drugs, opioid-like compounds are often found in cough suppressants, anti-nausea, and anti-diarrhea medications. Given that withdrawal from a drug often involves an experienceopposite to the effect of the drug, it should be no surprise that opioid withdrawal resembles a severe case of theflu. While opioid withdrawal can be extremely unpleasant, it is not life-threatening (Julien, 2005). Still, peopleexperiencing opioid withdrawal may be given methadone to make withdrawal from the drug less difficult.Methadone is a synthetic opioid that is less euphorigenic than heroin and similar drugs. Methadone clinicshelp people who previously struggled with opioid addiction manage withdrawal symptoms through the use ofmethadone. Other drugs, including the opioid buprenorphine, have also been used to alleviate symptoms ofopiate withdrawal.Codeine is an opioid with relatively low potency. It is often prescribed for minor pain, and it is available over-the-counter in some other countries. Like all opioids, codeine does have abuse potential. In fact, abuse ofprescription opioid medications is becoming a major concern worldwide (Aquina, Marques-Baptista,Bridgeman, & Merlin, 2009; Casati, Sedefov, & Pfeiffer-Gerschel, 2012).EVERYDAY CONNECTIONThe Opioid CrisisFew people in the United States remain untouched by the recent opioid epidemic. It seems like everyone knowsa friend, family member, or neighbor who has died of an overdose. Opioid addiction reached crisis levels in theUnited States such that by 2019, an average of 130 people died each dayof an opioid overdose (NIDA, 2019).The crisis actually began in the 1990s, when pharmaceutical companies began mass-marketing pain-relievingopioid drugs like OxyContin with the promise (now known to be false) that they were non-addictive. Increasedprescriptions led to greater rates of misuse, along with greater incidence of addiction, even among patients whoused these drugs as prescribed. Physiologically, the body can become addicted to opiate drugs in less than aweek, including when taken as prescribed. Withdrawal from opioids includes pain, which patients oftenmisinterpret as pain caused by the problem that led to the original prescription, and which motivates patients tocontinue using the drugs.The FDA's 2013 recommendation for tighter controls on opiate prescriptions left many patients addicted toprescription drugs like OxyContin unable to obtain legitimate prescriptions. This created a black market for thedrug, where prices soared to $80 or more for a single pill. To prevent withdrawal, many people turned to cheaperheroin, which could be bought for $5 a dose or less. To keep heroin affordable, many dealers began adding morepotent synthetic opioids including fentanyl and carfentanyl to increase the effects of heroin. These syntheticdrugs are so potent that even small doses can cause overdose and death.Large-scale public health campaigns by the National Institutes of Health and the National Institute of Drug Abusehave led to recent declines in the opioid crisis.

In some cases, users experience vivid visual hallucinations. It is also common forthese types of drugs to cause hallucinations of body sensations (e.g., feeling as if you are a giant) and a skewedperception of the passage of time.FIGURE 4.18 Psychedelic images like this are often associated with hallucinogenic compounds. (credit:modification of work by \"new 1lluminati\"/Flickr)As a group, hallucinogens are incredibly varied in terms of the neurotransmitter systems they affect.Mescaline and LSD are serotonin agonists, and PCP (angel dust) and ketamine (an animal anesthetic) act asantagonists of the NMDA glutamate receptor. In general, these drugs are not thought to possess the same sortof abuse potential as other classes of drugs discussed in this section.LINK TO LEARNINGTo learn more about some of the most commonly abused prescription and street drugs, check out theCommonly Abused Drugs Chart (http://openstax.org/l/drugabuse) and the Commonly Abused PrescriptionDrugs Chart (http://openstax.org/l/Rxabuse) from the National Institute on Drug Abuse.DIG DEEPERMedical MarijuanaThe decade from 2010\u20132019 brought many changes in laws regarding marijuana. While the possession and useof marijuana remains illegal in many states, it is now legal to possess limited quantities of marijuana forrecreational use in eleven states: Alaska, California, Colorado, Illinois, Maine, Massachusetts, Michigan, Nevada,Oregon, Vermont, and Washington. Medical marijuana is legal in over half of the United States and in the Districtof Columbia (Figure 4.19). Medical marijuana is marijuana that is prescribed by a doctor for the treatment of ahealth condition. For example, people who undergo chemotherapy will often be prescribed marijuana tostimulate their appetites and prevent excessive weight loss resulting from the side effects of chemotherapytreatment. Marijuana may also have some promise in the treatment of a variety of medical conditions (Mather,Rauwendaal, Moxham-Hall, & Wodak, 2013; Robson, 2014; Schicho & Storr, 2014)."

There is quite a bit of controversy within the scientific community as to the extent to whichmarijuana might have medicinal benefits due to a lack of large-scale, controlled research (Bostwick, 2012). As aresult, many scientists have urged the federal government to allow for relaxation of current marijuana laws andclassifications in order to facilitate a more widespread study of the drug\u2019s effects (Aggarwal et al., 2009;Bostwick, 2012; Kogan & Mechoulam, 2007).Until recently, the United States Department of Justice routinely arrested people involved and seized marijuanaused in medicinal settings. In the latter part of 2013, however, the United States Department of Justice issuedstatements indicating that they would not continue to challenge state medical marijuana laws. This shift in policymay be in response to the scientific community\u2019s recommendations and/or reflect changing public opinionregarding marijuana."

We also alter our consciousnessthrough the use of various psychoactive drugs. This final section will consider hypnotic and meditative statesas additional examples of altered states of consciousness experienced by some individuals.HypnosisHypnosis is a state of extreme self-focus and attention in which minimal attention is given to external stimuli.In the therapeutic setting, a clinician may use relaxation and suggestion in an attempt to alter the thoughtsand perceptions of a patient. Hypnosis has also been used to draw out information believed to be buried deeplyin someone\u2019s memory. For individuals who are especially open to the power of suggestion, hypnosis can proveto be a very effective technique, and brain imaging studies have demonstrated that hypnotic states areassociated with global changes in brain functioning (Del Casale et al., 2012; Guldenmund, Vanhaudenhuyse,Boly, Laureys, & Soddu, 2012).Historically, hypnosis has been viewed with some suspicion because of its portrayal in popular media andentertainment (Figure 4.20). Therefore, it is important to make a distinction between hypnosis as anempirically based therapeutic approach versus as a form of entertainment. Contrary to popular belief,individuals undergoing hypnosis usually have clear memories of the hypnotic experience and are in control oftheir own behaviors. While hypnosis may be useful in enhancing memory or a skill, such enhancements arevery modest in nature (Raz, 2011)."

While there are variations, there arefour parts that appear consistent in bringing people into the state of suggestibility associated with hypnosis(National Research Council, 1994). These components include:\u2022 The participant is guided to focus on one thing, such as the hypnotist\u2019s words or a ticking watch.\u2022 The participant is made comfortable and is directed to be relaxed and sleepy.\u2022 The participant is told to be open to the process of hypnosis, trust the hypnotist and let go.\u2022 The participant is encouraged to use their imagination.These steps are conducive to being open to the heightened suggestibility of hypnosis.People vary in terms of their ability to be hypnotized, but a review of available research suggests that mostpeople are at least moderately hypnotizable (Kihlstrom, 2013). Hypnosis in conjunction with other techniquesis used for a variety of therapeutic purposes and has shown to be at least somewhat effective for painmanagement, treatment of depression and anxiety, smoking cessation, and weight loss (Alladin, 2012; Elkins,Johnson, & Fisher, 2012; Golden, 2012; Montgomery, Schnur, & Kravits, 2012).How does hypnosis work? Two theories attempt to answer this question: One theory views hypnosis asdissociation and the other theory views it as the performance of a social role. According to the dissociationview, hypnosis is effectively a dissociated state of consciousness, much like our earlier example where you maydrive to work, but you are only minimally aware of the process of driving because your attention is focusedelsewhere. This theory is supported by Ernest Hilgard\u2019s research into hypnosis and pain. In Hilgard\u2019sexperiments, he induced participants into a state of hypnosis, and placed their arms into ice water.Participants were told they would not feel pain, but they could press a button if they did; while they reportednot feeling pain, they did, in fact, press the button, suggesting a dissociation of consciousness while in thehypnotic state (Hilgard & Hilgard, 1994).Taking a different approach to explain hypnosis, the social-cognitive theory of hypnosis sees people inhypnotic states as performing the social role of a hypnotized person. As you will learn when you study socialroles, people\u2019s behavior can be shaped by their expectations of how they should act in a given situation. Someview a hypnotized person\u2019s behavior not as an altered or dissociated state of consciousness, but as theirfulfillment of the social expectations for that role (Coe, 2009; Coe & Sarbin, 1966)."

While hypnosis is generally achieved through the interaction of a therapist and theperson being treated, an individual can perform meditation alone. Often, however, people wishing to learn tomeditate receive some training in techniques to achieve a meditative state.Although there are a number of different techniques in use, the central feature of all meditation is clearing themind in order to achieve a state of relaxed awareness and focus (Chen et al., 2013; Lang et al., 2012).Mindfulness meditation has recently become popular. In the variation of mindful meditation, the meditator\u2019sattention is focused on some internal process or an external object (Zeidan, Grant, Brown, McHaffie, & Coghill,2012).Meditative techniques have their roots in religious practices (Figure 4.21), but their use has grown inpopularity among practitioners of alternative medicine. Research indicates that meditation may help reduceblood pressure, and the American Heart Association suggests that meditation might be used in conjunctionwith more traditional treatments as a way to manage hypertension, although there is not sufficient data for arecommendation to be made (Brook et al., 2013). Like hypnosis, meditation also shows promise in stressmanagement, sleep quality (Caldwell, Harrison, Adams, Quin, & Greeson, 2010), treatment of mood andanxiety disorders (Chen et al., 2013; Freeman et al., 2010; V\u00f8llestad, Nielsen, & Nielsen, 2012), and painmanagement (Reiner, Tibi, & Lipsitz, 2013).FIGURE 4.21 (a) This is a statue of a meditating Buddha, representing one of the many religious traditions of whichmeditation plays a part.

Sensory receptors are specialized neurons that respond to specifictypes of stimuli. When sensory information is detected by a sensory receptor, sensation has occurred. Forexample, light that enters the eye causes chemical changes in cells that line the back of the eye. These cellsrelay messages, in the form of action potentials (as you learned when studying biopsychology), to the centralnervous system. The conversion from sensory stimulus energy to action potential is known as transduction.You have probably known since elementary school that we have five senses: vision, hearing (audition), smell(olfaction), taste (gustation), and touch (somatosensation). It turns out that this notion of five senses isoversimplified. We also have sensory systems that provide information about balance (the vestibular sense),body position and movement (proprioception and kinesthesia), pain (nociception), and temperature(thermoception).The sensitivity of a given sensory system to the relevant stimuli can be expressed as an absolute threshold.Absolute threshold refers to the minimum amount of stimulus energy that must be present for the stimulus tobe detected 50% of the time. Another way to think about this is by asking how dim can a light be or how softcan a sound be and still be detected half of the time. The sensitivity of our sensory receptors can be quiteamazing. It has been estimated that on a clear night, the most sensitive sensory cells in the back of the eye candetect a candle flame 30 miles away (Okawa & Sampath, 2007). Under quiet conditions, the hair cells (thereceptor cells of the inner ear) can detect the tick of a clock 20 feet away (Galanter, 1962).It is also possible for us to get messages that are presented below the threshold for conscious awareness\u2014theseare called subliminal messages. A stimulus reaches a physiological threshold when it is strong enough toexcite sensory receptors and send nerve impulses to the brain: This is an absolute threshold. A message belowthat threshold is said to be subliminal: We receive it, but we are not consciously aware of it. Over the yearsthere has been a great deal of speculation about the use of subliminal messages in advertising, rock music, andself-help audio programs. Research evidence shows that in laboratory settings, people can process andrespond to information outside of awareness. But this does not mean that we obey these messages likezombies; in fact, hidden messages have little effect on behavior outside the laboratory (Kunst-Wilson & Zajonc,1980; Rensink, 2004; Nelson, 2008; Radel, Sarrazin, Legrain, & Gobanc\u00e9, 2009; Loersch, Durso, & Petty, 2013).Absolute thresholds are generally measured under incredibly controlled conditions in situations that areoptimal for sensitivity. Sometimes, we are more interested in how much difference in stimuli is required todetect a difference between them. This is known as the just noticeable difference (jnd) or differencethreshold. Unlike the absolute threshold, the difference threshold changes depending on the stimulusintensity. As an example, imagine yourself in a very dark movie theater. If an audience member were to receivea text message that caused the cell phone screen to light up, chances are that many people would notice thechange in illumination in the theater. However, if the same thing happened in a brightly lit arena during abasketball game, very few people would notice. The cell phone brightness does not change, but its ability to bedetected as a change in illumination varies dramatically between the two contexts. Ernst Weber proposed thistheory of change in difference threshold in the 1830s, and it has become known as Weber\u2019s law: The differencethreshold is a constant fraction of the original stimulus, as the example illustrates."

        "data": "Page 1475.1 \u2022 Sensation versus Perception 147PerceptionWhile our sensory receptors are constantly collecting information from the environment, it is ultimately howwe interpret that information that affects how we interact with the world. Perception refers to the way sensoryinformation is organized, interpreted, and consciously experienced. Perception involves both bottom-up andtop-down processing. Bottom-up processing refers to sensory information from a stimulus in theenvironment driving a process, and top-down processing refers to knowledge and expectancy driving aprocess, as shown in Figure 5.2 (Egeth & Yantis, 1997; Fine & Minnery, 2009; Yantis & Egeth, 1999).FIGURE 5.2 Top-down and bottom-up are ways we process our perceptions.Imagine that you and some friends are sitting in a crowded restaurant eating lunch and talking. It is very noisy,and you are concentrating on your friend\u2019s face to hear what they are saying, then the sound of breaking glassand clang of metal pans hitting the floor rings out. The server dropped a large tray of food. Although you wereattending to your meal and conversation, that crashing sound would likely get through your attentional filtersand capture your attention. You would have no choice but to notice it. That attentional capture would be causedby the sound from the environment: it would be bottom-up.Alternatively, top-down processes are generally goal directed, slow, deliberate, effortful, and under yourcontrol (Fine & Minnery, 2009; Miller & Cohen, 2001; Miller & D'Esposito, 2005). For instance, if you misplacedyour keys, how would you look for them? If you had a yellow key fob, you would probably look for yellowness ofa certain size in specific locations, such as on the counter, coffee table, and other similar places. You would notlook for yellowness on your ceiling fan, because you know keys are not normally lying on top of a ceiling fan.That act of searching for a certain size of yellowness in some locations and not others would be top-down\u2014under your control and based on your experience.One way to think of this concept is that sensation is a physical process, whereas perception is psychological.For example, upon walking into a kitchen and smelling the scent of baking cinnamon rolls, the sensationis thescent receptors detecting the odor of cinnamon, but the perceptionmay be \u201cMmm, this smells like the breadGrandma used to bake when the family gathered for holidays.\u201dAlthough our perceptions are built from sensations, not all sensations result in perception. In fact, we oftendon\u2019t perceive stimuli that remain relatively constant over prolonged periods of time. This is known assensory adaptation. Imagine going to a city that you have never visited. You check in to the hotel, but whenyou get to your room, there is a road construction sign with a bright flashing light outside your window.Unfortunately, there are no other rooms available, so you are stuck with a flashing light. You decide to watchtelevision to unwind. The flashing light was extremely annoying when you first entered your room. It was as ifsomeone was continually turning a bright yellow spotlight on and off in your room, but after watchingtelevision for a short while, you no longer notice the light flashing. The light is still flashing and filling yourroom with yellow light every few seconds, and the photoreceptors in your eyes still sense the light, but you nolonger perceive the rapid changes in lighting conditions. That you no longer perceive the flashing lightdemonstrates sensory adaptation and shows that while closely associated, sensation and perception aredifferent."

        "data": "Page 148148 5 \u2022 Sensation and PerceptionThere is another factor that affects sensation and perception: attention. Attention plays a significant role indetermining what is sensed versus what is perceived. Imagine you are at a party full of music, chatter, andlaughter. You get involved in an interesting conversation with a friend, and you tune out all the backgroundnoise. If someone interrupted you to ask what song had just finished playing, you would probably be unable toanswer that question.LINK TO LEARNINGSee for yourself how inattentional blindness works by checking out this selective attention test(http://openstax.org/l/blindness) from Simons and Chabris (1999).One of the most interesting demonstrations of how important attention is in determining our perception of theenvironment occurred in a famous study conducted by Daniel Simons and Christopher Chabris (1999). In thisstudy, participants watched a video of people dressed in black and white passing basketballs. Participantswere asked to count the number of times the team dressed in white passed the ball. During the video, a persondressed in a black gorilla costume walks among the two teams. You would think that someone would notice thegorilla, right? Nearly half of the people who watched the video didn\u2019t notice the gorilla at all, despite the factthat he was clearly visible for nine seconds. Because participants were so focused on the number of times theteam dressed in white was passing the ball, they completely tuned out other visual information. Inattentionalblindness is the failure to notice something that is completely visible because the person was activelyattending to something else and did not pay attention to other things (Mack & Rock, 1998; Simons & Chabris,1999).In a similar experiment, researchers tested inattentional blindness by asking participants to observe imagesmoving across a computer screen. They were instructed to focus on either white or black objects, disregardingthe other color. When a red cross passed across the screen, about one third of subjects did not notice it (Figure5.3) (Most, Simons, Scholl, & Chabris, 2000).FIGURE 5.3 Nearly one third of participants in a study did not notice that a red cross passed on the screen becausetheir attention was focused on the black or white figures. (credit: Cory Zanker)Motivation can also affect perception. Have you ever been expecting a really important phone call and, whiletaking a shower, you think you hear the phone ringing, only to discover that it is not? If so, then you haveexperienced how motivation to detect a meaningful stimulus can shift our ability to discriminate between atrue sensory stimulus and background noise. The ability to identify a stimulus when it is embedded in adistracting background is called signal detection theory. This might also explain why a mother is awakenedby a quiet murmur from her baby but not by other sounds that occur while she is asleep. Signal detectiontheory has practical applications, such as increasing air traffic controller accuracy. Controllers need to be ableto detect planes among many signals (blips) that appear on the radar screen and follow those planes as theymove through the sky. In fact, the original work of the researcher who developed signal detection theory wasfocused on improving the sensitivity of air traffic controllers to plane blips (Swets, 1964)."

Asyou will see later in this chapter, individuals who are deprived of the experience of binocular vision duringcritical periods of development have trouble perceiving depth (Fawcett, Wang, & Birch, 2005). The sharedexperiences of people within a given cultural context can have pronounced effects on perception. For example,Marshall Segall, Donald Campbell, and Melville Herskovits (1963) published the results of a multinationalstudy in which they demonstrated that individuals from Western cultures were more prone to experiencecertain types of visual illusions than individuals from non-Western cultures, and vice versa. One such illusionthat Westerners were more likely to experience was the M\u00fcller-Lyer illusion (Figure 5.4): The lines appear to bedifferent lengths, but they are actually the same length.FIGURE 5.4 In the M\u00fcller-Lyer illusion, lines appear to be different lengths although they are identical. (a) Arrows atthe ends of lines may make the line on the right appear longer, although the lines are the same length. (b) Whenapplied to a three-dimensional image, the line on the right again may appear longer although both black lines arethe same length.These perceptual differences were consistent with differences in the types of environmental featuresexperienced on a regular basis by people in a given cultural context. People in Western cultures, for example,have a perceptual context of buildings with straight lines, what Segall\u2019s study called a carpentered world (Segallet al., 1966). In contrast, people from certain non-Western cultures with an uncarpentered view, such as theZulu of South Africa, whose villages are made up of round huts arranged in circles, are less susceptible to thisillusion (Segall et al., 1999). It is not just vision that is affected by cultural factors. Indeed, research hasdemonstrated that the ability to identify an odor, and rate its pleasantness and its intensity, varies cross-culturally (Ayabe-Kanamura, Saito, Distel, Mart\u00ednez-G\u00f3mez, & Hudson, 1998).Children described as thrill seekers are more likely to show taste preferences for intense sour flavors (Liem,Westerbeek, Wolterink, Kok, & de Graaf, 2004), which suggests that basic aspects of personality might affectperception. Furthermore, individuals who hold positive attitudes toward reduced-fat foods are more likely torate foods labeled as reduced fat as tasting better than people who have less positive attitudes about theseproducts (Aaron, Mela, & Evans, 1994)."

In this section, we describe the physical properties of the waves as well as the perceptualexperiences associated with them.Amplitude and WavelengthTwo physical characteristics of a wave are amplitude and wavelength (Figure 5.5). The amplitude of a wave isthe distance from the center line to the top point of the crest or the bottom point of the trough. Wavelengthrefers to the length of a wave from one peak to the next.FIGURE 5.5 The amplitude or height of a wave is measured from the peak to the trough. The wavelength ismeasured from peak to peak.Wavelength is directly related to the frequency of a given wave form. Frequency refers to the number of wavesthat pass a given point in a given time period and is often expressed in terms of hertz (Hz), or cycles persecond. Longer wavelengths will have lower frequencies, and shorter wavelengths will have higher frequencies(Figure 5.6).FIGURE 5.6 This figure illustrates waves of differing wavelengths/frequencies. At the top of the figure, the red wavehas a long wavelength/short frequency. Moving from top to bottom, the wavelengths decrease and frequenciesincrease.Light WavesThe visible spectrum is the portion of the larger electromagnetic spectrum that we can see. As Figure 5.7shows, the electromagnetic spectrum encompasses all of the electromagnetic radiation that occurs in ourenvironment and includes gamma rays, x-rays, ultraviolet light, visible light, infrared light, microwaves, andradio waves. The visible spectrum in humans is associated with wavelengths that range from 380 to 740 nm\u2014avery small distance, since a nanometer (nm) is one billionth of a meter. Other species can detect other portionsof the electromagnetic spectrum. For instance, honeybees can see light in the ultraviolet range (Wakakuwa,Stavenga, & Arikawa, 2007), and some snakes can detect infrared radiation in addition to more traditionalvisual light cues (Chen, Deng, Brauth, Ding, & Tang, 2012; Hartline, Kass, & Loop, 1978)."

Within the visible spectrum,our experience of red is associated with longer wavelengths, greens are intermediate, and blues and violets areshorter in wavelength. (An easy way to remember this is the mnemonic ROYGBIV: red, orange, yellow, green,blue, indigo, violet.) The amplitude of light waves is associated with our experience of brightness or intensity ofcolor, with larger amplitudes appearing brighter.FIGURE 5.8 Different wavelengths of light are associated with our perception of different colors. (credit:modification of work by Johannes Ahlmann)Sound WavesLike light waves, the physical properties of sound waves are associated with various aspects of our perceptionof sound. The frequency of a sound wave is associated with our perception of that sound\u2019s pitch. High-frequency sound waves are perceived as high-pitched sounds, while low-frequency sound waves are perceivedas low-pitched sounds. The audible range of sound frequencies is between 20 and 20000 Hz, with greatestsensitivity to those frequencies that fall in the middle of this range.As was the case with the visible spectrum, other species show differences in their audible ranges. For instance,chickens have a very limited audible range, from 125 to 2000 Hz. Mice have an audible range from 1000 to91000 Hz, and the beluga whale\u2019s audible range is from 1000 to 123000 Hz. Our pet dogs and cats have audibleranges of about 70\u201345000 Hz and 45\u201364000 Hz, respectively (Strain, 2003).The loudness of a given sound is closely associated with the amplitude of the sound wave. Higher amplitudesare associated with louder sounds. Loudness is measured in terms of decibels (dB), a logarithmic unit ofsound intensity. A typical conversation would correlate with 60 dB; a rock concert might check in at 120 dB(Figure 5.9). A whisper 5 feet away or rustling leaves are at the low end of our hearing range; sounds like awindow air conditioner, a normal conversation, and even heavy traffic or a vacuum cleaner are within atolerable range. However, there is the potential for hearing damage from about 80 dB to 130 dB: These aresounds of a food processor, power lawnmower, heavy truck (25 feet away), subway train (20 feet away), live"

About one-third of all hearing loss is due to noise exposure, and the louder thesound, the shorter the exposure needed to cause hearing damage (Le, Straatman, Lea, & Westerberg, 2017).Listening to music through earbuds at maximum volume (around 100\u2013105 decibels) can cause noise-inducedhearing loss after 15 minutes of exposure. Although listening to music at maximum volume may not seem tocause damage, it increases the risk of age-related hearing loss (Kujawa & Liberman, 2006).

Light waves are transmitted across thecornea and enter the eye through the pupil. The cornea is the transparent covering over the eye. It serves as abarrier between the inner eye and the outside world, and it is involved in focusing light waves that enter theeye. The pupil is the small opening in the eye through which light passes, and the size of the pupil can changeas a function of light levels as well as emotional arousal. When light levels are low, the pupil will becomedilated, or expanded, to allow more light to enter the eye. When light levels are high, the pupil will constrict, orbecome smaller, to reduce the amount of light that enters the eye. The pupil\u2019s size is controlled by muscles thatare connected to the iris, which is the colored portion of the eye."

The lens is attached to muscles that can change its shape to aid in focusing light that isreflected from near or far objects. In a normal-sighted individual, the lens will focus images perfectly on asmall indentation in the back of the eye known as the fovea, which is part of the retina, the light-sensitivelining of the eye. The fovea contains densely packed specialized photoreceptor cells (Figure 5.12). Thesephotoreceptor cells, known as cones, are light-detecting cells. The cones are specialized types ofphotoreceptors that work best in bright light conditions. Cones are very sensitive to acute detail and providetremendous spatial resolution. They also are directly involved in our ability to perceive color.While cones are concentrated in the fovea, where images tend to be focused, rods, another type ofphotoreceptor, are located throughout the remainder of the retina. Rods are specialized photoreceptors thatwork well in low light conditions, and while they lack the spatial resolution and color function of the cones,they are involved in our vision in dimly lit environments as well as in our perception of movement on theperiphery of our visual field."

Cones are colored green and rods are blue.We have all experienced the different sensitivities of rods and cones when making the transition from abrightly lit environment to a dimly lit environment. Imagine going to see a blockbuster movie on a clearsummer day. As you walk from the brightly lit lobby into the dark theater, you notice that you immediately havedifficulty seeing much of anything. After a few minutes, you begin to adjust to the darkness and can see theinterior of the theater. In the bright environment, your vision was dominated primarily by cone activity. As youmove to the dark environment, rod activity dominates, but there is a delay in transitioning between the phases.If your rods do not transform light into nerve impulses as easily and efficiently as they should, you will havedifficulty seeing in dim light, a condition known as night blindness.Rods and cones are connected (via several interneurons) to retinal ganglion cells. Axons from the retinalganglion cells converge and exit through the back of the eye to form the optic nerve. The optic nerve carriesvisual information from the retina to the brain. There is a point in the visual field called the blind spot: Evenwhen light from a small object is focused on the blind spot, we do not see it. We are not consciously aware ofour blind spots for two reasons: First, each eye gets a slightly different view of the visual field; therefore, theblind spots do not overlap. Second, our visual system fills in the blind spot so that although we cannot respondto visual information that occurs in that portion of the visual field, we are also not aware that information ismissing.The optic nerve from each eye merges just below the brain at a point called the optic chiasm. As Figure 5.13shows, the optic chiasm is an X-shaped structure that sits just below the cerebral cortex at the front of thebrain. At the point of the optic chiasm, information from the right visual field (which comes from both eyes) issent to the left side of the brain, and information from the left visual field is sent to the right side of the brain."

They collaborated for more than twenty years and made significant discoveries about theneurology of visual perception (Hubel & Wiesel, 1959, 1962, 1963, 1970; Wiesel & Hubel, 1963). They studiedanimals, mostly cats and monkeys. Although they used several techniques, they did considerable single unitrecordings, during which tiny electrodes were inserted in the animal\u2019s brain to determine when a single cell wasactivated. Among their many discoveries, they found that specific brain cells respond to lines with specificorientations (called ocular dominance), and they mapped the way those cells are arranged in areas of the visualcortex known as columns and hypercolumns.In some of their research, they sutured one eye of newborn kittens closed and followed the development of thekittens' vision. They discovered there was a critical period of development for vision. If kittens were deprived ofinput from one eye, other areas of their visual cortex filled in the area that was normally used by the eye that wassewn closed. In other words, neural connections that exist at birth can be lost if they are deprived of sensoryinput.What do you think about sewing a kitten's eye closed for research? To many animal advocates, this would seembrutal, abusive, and unethical. What if you could do research that would help ensure babies and children bornwith certain conditions could develop full vision instead of becoming blind? Would you want that research done?Would you conduct that research, even if it meant causing some harm to cats? Would you think the same way if"

What if you worked at the animal shelter?Like virtually every other industrialized nation, the United States permits medical experimentation on animals,with few limitations (assuming sufficient scientific justification). The goal of any laws that exist is not to ban suchtests but rather to limit unnecessary animal suffering by establishing standards for the humane treatment andhousing of animals in laboratories.As explained by Stephen Latham, the director of the Interdisciplinary Center for Bioethics at Yale (2012),possible legal and regulatory approaches to animal testing vary on a continuum from strong governmentregulation and monitoring of all experimentation at one end, to a self-regulated approach that depends on theethics of the researchers at the other end. The United Kingdom has the most significant regulatory scheme,whereas Japan uses the self-regulation approach. The U.S. approach is somewhere in the middle, the result of agradual blending of the two approaches.There is no question that medical research is a valuable and important practice. The question is whether the useof animals is a necessary or even best practice for producing the most reliable results. Alternatives include theuse of patient-drug databases, virtual drug trials, computer models and simulations, and noninvasive imagingtechniques such as magnetic resonance imaging and computed tomography scans (\u201cAnimals in Science/Alternatives,\u201d n.d.). Other techniques, such as microdosing, use humans not as test animals but as a means toimprove the accuracy and reliability of test results. In vitro methods based on human cell and tissue cultures,stem cells, and genetic testing methods are also increasingly available.Today, at the local level, any facility that uses animals and receives federal funding must have an InstitutionalAnimal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) that ensures that the NIH guidelines are being followed.

Let\u2019s look at how color vision works and how we perceive three dimensions (height,width, and depth).Color VisionNormal-sighted individuals have three different types of cones that mediate color vision. Each of these conetypes is maximally sensitive to a slightly different wavelength of light. According to the trichromatic theory ofcolor vision, shown in Figure 5.14, all colors in the spectrum can be produced by combining red, green, andblue. The three types of cones are each receptive to one of the colors."

She looked up at me, and in her most stern voice, said, \u201cYou can\u2019t wear that.\u201d I asked, \"Why not?\" and sheinformed me the colors of my clothes did not match. She had complained frequently that I was bad at matching myshirts, pants, and ties, but this time, she sounded especially alarmed. As a single father with no one else to ask athome, I drove us to the nearest convenience store and asked the store clerk if my clothes matched. She said mypants were a bright green color, my shirt was a reddish orange, and my tie was brown. She looked at my quizzicallyand said, \"No way do your clothes match.\" Over the next few days, I started asking my coworkers and friends if myclothes matched. After several days of being told that my coworkers just thought I had \"a really unique style,\" Imade an appointment with an eye doctor and was tested (Figure 5.15). It was then that I found out that I wascolorblind. I cannot differentiate between most greens, browns, and reds. Fortunately, other than unknowinglybeing badly dressed, my colorblindness rarely harms my day-to-day life.FIGURE 5.15 The Ishihara test evaluates color perception by assessing whether individuals can discern numbersthat appear in a circle of dots of varying colors and sizes.Some forms of color deficiency are rare. Seeing in grayscale (only shades of black and white) is extremely rare, andpeople who do so only have rods, which means they have very low visual acuity and cannot see very well. The mostcommon X-linked inherited abnormality is red-green color blindness (Birch, 2012). Approximately 8% of males withEuropean Caucasian decent, 5% of Asian males, 4% of African males, and less than 2% of indigenous Americanmales, Australian males, and Polynesian males have red-green color deficiency (Birch, 2012).

According to this theory, color is coded in opponent pairs: black-white, yellow-blue, and green-red. The basic idea is that some cells of the visual system are excited by one of the opponentcolors and inhibited by the other. So, a cell that was excited by wavelengths associated with green would beinhibited by wavelengths associated with red, and vice versa. One of the implications of opponent processing isthat we do not experience greenish-reds or yellowish-blues as colors. Another implication is that this leads tothe experience of negative afterimages. An afterimage describes the continuation of a visual sensation afterremoval of the stimulus. For example, when you stare briefly at the sun and then look away from it, you maystill perceive a spot of light although the stimulus (the sun) has been removed. When color is involved in thestimulus, the color pairings identified in the opponent-process theory lead to a negative afterimage. You cantest this concept using the flag in Figure 5.16.FIGURE 5.16 Stare at the white dot for 30\u201360 seconds and then move your eyes to a blank piece of white paper.What do you see? This is known as a negative afterimage, and it provides empirical support for the opponent-process theory of color vision.But these two theories\u2014the trichromatic theory of color vision and the opponent-process theory\u2014are notmutually exclusive. Research has shown that they just apply to different levels of the nervous system. Forvisual processing on the retina, trichromatic theory applies: the cones are responsive to three differentwavelengths that represent red, blue, and green. But once the signal moves past the retina on its way to thebrain, the cells respond in a way consistent with opponent-process theory (Land, 1959; Kaiser, 1997).LINK TO LEARNINGWatch this video about color perception (http://openstax.org/l/colorvision) to learn more.Depth PerceptionOur ability to perceive spatial relationships in three-dimensional (3-D) space is known as depth perception.With depth perception, we can describe things as being in front, behind, above, below, or to the side of otherthings.Our world is three-dimensional, so it makes sense that our mental representation of the world has three-dimensional properties. We use a variety of cues in a visual scene to establish our sense of depth. Some ofthese are binocular cues, which means that they rely on the use of both eyes. One example of a binoculardepth cue is binocular disparity, the slightly different view of the world that each of our eyes receives.

Now, close your left eye without moving your head, then open your left eye andclose your right eye without moving your head. You will notice that your finger seems to shift as you alternatebetween the two eyes because of the slightly different view each eye has of your finger.A 3-D movie works on the same principle: the special glasses you wear allow the two slightly different imagesprojected onto the screen to be seen separately by your left and your right eye. As your brain processes theseimages, you have the illusion that the leaping animal or running person is coming right toward you.Although we rely on binocular cues to experience depth in our 3-D world, we can also perceive depth in 2-Darrays. Think about all the paintings and photographs you have seen. Generally, you pick up on depth in theseimages even though the visual stimulus is 2-D. When we do this, we are relying on a number of monocularcues, or cues that require only one eye. If you think you can\u2019t see depth with one eye, note that you don\u2019t bumpinto things when using only one eye while walking\u2014and, in fact, we have more monocular cues than binocularcues.An example of a monocular cue would be what is known as linear perspective. Linear perspective refers to thefact that we perceive depth when we see two parallel lines that seem to converge in an image (Figure 5.17).Some other monocular depth cues are interposition, the partial overlap of objects, and the relative size andcloseness of images to the horizon.FIGURE 5.17 We perceive depth in a two-dimensional figure like this one through the use of monocular cues likelinear perspective, like the parallel lines converging as the road narrows in the distance.

He relied heavily on monocular depth cues, but he never had a trueappreciation of the 3-D nature of the world around him. This all changed one night in 2012 while Bruce wasseeing a movie with his wife.The movie the couple was going to see was shot in 3-D, and even though he thought it was a waste of money,Bruce paid for the 3-D glasses when he purchased his ticket. As soon as the film began, Bruce put on the glassesand experienced something completely new. For the first time in his life he appreciated the true depth of theworld around him. Remarkably, his ability to perceive depth persisted outside of the movie theater.There are cells in the nervous system that respond to binocular depth cues.

This translates into our ability to hearthe sounds of nature, to appreciate the beauty of music, and to communicate with one another through spokenlanguage. This section will provide an overview of the basic anatomy and function of the auditory system. Itwill include a discussion of how the sensory stimulus is translated into neural impulses, where in the brainthat information is processed, how we perceive pitch, and how we know where sound is coming from.Anatomy of the Auditory SystemThe ear can be separated into multiple sections. The outer ear includes the pinna, which is the visible part ofthe ear that protrudes from our heads, the auditory canal, and the tympanic membrane, or eardrum. Themiddle ear contains three tiny bones known as the ossicles, which are named the malleus (or hammer), incus(or anvil), and the stapes (or stirrup). The inner ear contains the semi-circular canals, which are involved inbalance and movement (the vestibular sense), and the cochlea. The cochlea is a fluid-filled, snail-shapedstructure that contains the sensory receptor cells (hair cells) of the auditory system (Figure 5.18).FIGURE 5.18 The ear is divided into outer (pinna and tympanic membrane), middle (the three ossicles: malleus,incus, and stapes), and inner (cochlea and basilar membrane) divisions.Sound waves travel along the auditory canal and strike the tympanic membrane, causing it to vibrate. Thisvibration results in movement of the three ossicles. As the ossicles move, the stapes presses into a thinmembrane of the cochlea known as the oval window. As the stapes presses into the oval window, the fluidinside the cochlea begins to move, which in turn stimulates hair cells, which are auditory receptor cells of theinner ear embedded in the basilar membrane. The basilar membrane is a thin strip of tissue within thecochlea."

        "data": "Page 162162 5 \u2022 Sensation and PerceptionThe activation of hair cells is a mechanical process: the stimulation of the hair cell ultimately leads toactivation of the cell. As hair cells become activated, they generate neural impulses that travel along theauditory nerve to the brain. Auditory information is shuttled to the inferior colliculus, the medial geniculatenucleus of the thalamus, and finally to the auditory cortex in the temporal lobe of the brain for processing. Likethe visual system, there is also evidence suggesting that information about auditory recognition andlocalization is processed in parallel streams (Rauschecker & Tian, 2000; Renier et al., 2009).Pitch PerceptionDifferent frequencies of sound waves are associated with differences in our perception of the pitch of thosesounds. Low-frequency sounds are lower pitched, and high-frequency sounds are higher pitched. How doesthe auditory system differentiate among various pitches?Several theories have been proposed to account for pitch perception. We\u2019ll discuss two of them here: temporaltheory and place theory. The temporal theory of pitch perception asserts that frequency is coded by theactivity level of a sensory neuron. This would mean that a given hair cell would fire action potentials related tothe frequency of the sound wave. While this is a very intuitive explanation, we detect such a broad range offrequencies (20\u201320,000 Hz) that the frequency of action potentials fired by hair cells cannot account for theentire range. Because of properties related to sodium channels on the neuronal membrane that are involved inaction potentials, there is a point at which a cell cannot fire any faster (Shamma, 2001).The place theory of pitch perception suggests that different portions of the basilar membrane are sensitive tosounds of different frequencies. More specifically, the base of the basilar membrane responds best to highfrequencies and the tip of the basilar membrane responds best to low frequencies. Therefore, hair cells thatare in the base portion would be labeled as high-pitch receptors, while those in the tip of basilar membranewould be labeled as low-pitch receptors (Shamma, 2001).In reality, both theories explain different aspects of pitch perception. At frequencies up to about 4000 Hz, it isclear that both the rate of action potentials and place contribute to our perception of pitch. However, muchhigher frequency sounds can only be encoded using place cues (Shamma, 2001).Sound LocalizationThe ability to locate sound in our environments is an important part of hearing. Localizing sound could beconsidered similar to the way that we perceive depth in our visual fields. Like the monocular and binocularcues that provided information about depth, the auditory system uses both monaural (one-eared) andbinaural (two-eared) cues to localize sound.Each pinna interacts with incoming sound waves differently, depending on the sound\u2019s source relative to ourbodies. This interaction provides a monaural cue that is helpful in locating sounds that occur above or belowand in front or behind us. The sound waves received by your two ears from sounds that come from directlyabove, below, in front, or behind you would be identical; therefore, monaural cues are essential (Grothe, Pecka,& McAlpine, 2010).Binaural cues, on the other hand, provide information on the location of a sound along a horizontal axis byrelying on differences in patterns of vibration of the eardrum between our two ears. If a sound comes from anoff-center location, it creates two types of binaural cues: interaural level differences and interaural timingdifferences. Interaural level difference refers to the fact that a sound coming from the right side of your bodyis more intense at your right ear than at your left ear because of the attenuation of the sound wave as it passesthrough your head. Interaural timing difference refers to the small difference in the time at which a givensound wave arrives at each ear (Figure 5.19). Certain brain areas monitor these differences to construct wherealong a horizontal axis a sound originates (Grothe et al., 2010)."

Other people suffer from conductive hearing loss, which is due to a problem deliveringsound energy to the cochlea. Causes for conductive hearing loss include blockage of the ear canal, a hole in thetympanic membrane, problems with the ossicles, or fluid in the space between the eardrum and cochlea.Another group of people suffer from sensorineural hearing loss, which is the most common form of hearingloss. Sensorineural hearing loss can be caused by many factors, such as aging, head or acoustic trauma,infections and diseases (such as measles or mumps), medications, environmental effects such as noiseexposure (noise-induced hearing loss, as shown in Figure 5.20), tumors, and toxins (such as those found incertain solvents and metals).FIGURE 5.20 Environmental factors that can lead to sensorineural hearing loss include regular exposure to loudmusic or construction equipment.

These problems are often dealt with through devices like hearing aids that amplify incoming soundwaves to make vibration of the eardrum and movement of the ossicles more likely to occur.When the hearing problem is associated with a failure to transmit neural signals from the cochlea to the brain,it is called sensorineural hearing loss. One disease that results in sensorineural hearing loss is M\u00e9ni\u00e8re'sdisease. Although not well understood, M\u00e9ni\u00e8re's disease results in a degeneration of inner ear structures thatcan lead to hearing loss, tinnitus (constant ringing or buzzing), vertigo (a sense of spinning), and an increasein pressure within the inner ear (Semaan & Megerian, 2011). This kind of loss cannot be treated with hearingaids, but some individuals might be candidates for a cochlear implant as a treatment option. Cochlearimplants are electronic devices that consist of a microphone, a speech processor, and an electrode array. Thedevice receives incoming sound information and directly stimulates the auditory nerve to transmitinformation to the brain.LINK TO LEARNINGWatch this video about cochlear implant surgeries (http://openstax.org/l/cochlear) to learn more.WHAT DO YOU THINK?Deaf CultureIn the United States and other places around the world, deaf people have their own language, schools, andcustoms. This is called deaf culture. In the United States, deaf individuals often communicate using AmericanSign Language (ASL); ASL has no verbal component and is based entirely on visual signs and gestures. Theprimary mode of communication is signing. One of the values of deaf culture is to continue traditions like usingsign language rather than teaching deaf children to try to speak, read lips, or have cochlear implant surgery.When a child is diagnosed as deaf, parents have difficult decisions to make. Should the child be enrolled inmainstream schools and taught to verbalize and read lips? Or should the child be sent to a school for deafchildren to learn ASL and have significant exposure to deaf culture? Do you think there might be differences inthe way that parents approach these decisions depending on whether or not they are also deaf?"

Research demonstrates, however, that we have at least six taste groupings. Umami is our fifth taste.Umami is actually a Japanese word that roughly translates to yummy, and it is associated with a taste formonosodium glutamate (Kinnamon & Vandenbeuch, 2009). There is also a growing body of experimentalevidence suggesting that we possess a taste for the fatty content of a given food (Mizushige, Inoue, & Fushiki,2007).Molecules from the food and beverages we consume dissolve in our saliva and interact with taste receptors onour tongue and in our mouth and throat. Taste buds are formed by groupings of taste receptor cells with hair-like extensions that protrude into the central pore of the taste bud (Figure 5.21). Taste buds have a life cycle often days to two weeks, so even destroying some by burning your tongue won\u2019t have any long-term effect; theyjust grow right back. Taste molecules bind to receptors on this extension and cause chemical changes withinthe sensory cell that result in neural impulses being transmitted to the brain via different nerves, dependingon where the receptor is located. Taste information is transmitted to the medulla, thalamus, and limbicsystem, and to the gustatory cortex, which is tucked underneath the overlap between the frontal and temporallobes (Maffei, Haley, & Fontanini, 2012; Roper, 2013).FIGURE 5.21 (a) Taste buds are composed of a number of individual taste receptors cells that transmit informationto nerves.

Small hair-like extensionsfrom these receptors serve as the sites for odor molecules dissolved in the mucus to interact with chemicalreceptors located on these extensions (Figure 5.22). Once an odor molecule has bound a given receptor,chemical changes within the cell result in signals being sent to the olfactory bulb: a bulb-like structure at thetip of the frontal lobe where the olfactory nerves begin. From the olfactory bulb, information is sent to regionsof the limbic system and to the primary olfactory cortex, which is located very near the gustatory cortex(Lodovichi & Belluscio, 2012; Spors et al., 2013)."

We often think ofdogs as having far superior olfactory systems than our own, and indeed, dogs can do some remarkable thingswith their noses. There is some evidence to suggest that dogs can \u201csmell\u201d dangerous drops in blood glucoselevels as well as cancerous tumors (Wells, 2010). Dogs\u2019 extraordinary olfactory abilities may be due to theincreased number of functional genes for olfactory receptors (between 800 and 1200), compared to the fewerthan 400 observed in humans and other primates (Niimura & Nei, 2007).Many species respond to chemical messages, known as pheromones, sent by another individual (Wysocki &Preti, 2004). Pheromonal communication often involves providing information about the reproductive statusof a potential mate. So, for example, when a female rat is ready to mate, it secretes pheromonal signals thatdraw attention from nearby male rats. Pheromonal activation is actually an important component in elicitingsexual behavior in the male rat (Furlow, 1996, 2012; Purvis & Haynes, 1972; Sachs, 1997). There has also beena good deal of research (and controversy) about pheromones in humans (Comfort, 1971; Russell, 1976;Wolfgang-Kimball, 1992; Weller, 1998).Touch, Thermoception, and NociceptionA number of receptors are distributed throughout the skin to respond to various touch-related stimuli (Figure5.23). These receptors include Meissner\u2019s corpuscles, Pacinian corpuscles, Merkel\u2019s disks, and Ruffinicorpuscles. Meissner\u2019s corpuscles respond to pressure and lower frequency vibrations, and Paciniancorpuscles detect transient pressure and higher frequency vibrations. Merkel\u2019s disks respond to lightpressure, while Ruffini corpuscles detect stretch (Abraira & Ginty, 2013)."

These nerve endings respond to a variety of different types of touch-related stimuli andserve as sensory receptors for both thermoception (temperature perception) and nociception (a signalindicating potential harm and maybe pain) (Garland, 2012; Petho & Reeh, 2012; Spray, 1986). Sensoryinformation collected from the receptors and free nerve endings travels up the spinal cord and is transmittedto regions of the medulla, thalamus, and ultimately to somatosensory cortex, which is located in thepostcentral gyrus of the parietal lobe.Pain PerceptionPain is an unpleasant experience that involves both physical and psychological components. Feeling pain isquite adaptive because it makes us aware of an injury, and it motivates us to remove ourselves from the causeof that injury. In addition, pain also makes us less likely to suffer additional injury because we will be gentlerwith our injured body parts.Generally speaking, pain can be considered to be neuropathic or inflammatory in nature. Pain that signalssome type of tissue damage is known as inflammatory pain. In some situations, pain results from damage toneurons of either the peripheral or central nervous system. As a result, pain signals that are sent to the brainget exaggerated. This type of pain is known as neuropathic pain. Multiple treatment options for pain reliefrange from relaxation therapy to the use of analgesic medications to deep brain stimulation. The most effectivetreatment option for a given individual will depend on a number of considerations, including the severity andpersistence of the pain and any medical/psychological conditions.Some individuals are born without the ability to feel pain. This very rare genetic disorder is known ascongenital insensitivity to pain (or congenital analgesia). While those with congenital analgesia can detectdifferences in temperature and pressure, they cannot experience pain. As a result, they often suffer significantinjuries. Young children have serious mouth and tongue injuries because they have bitten themselvesrepeatedly. Not surprisingly, individuals suffering from this disorder have much shorter life expectancies dueto their injuries and secondary infections of injured sites (U.S. National Library of Medicine, 2013).LINK TO LEARNINGWatch this video about congenital insensitivity to pain (http://openstax.org/l/congenital) to learn more.The Vestibular Sense, Proprioception, and KinesthesiaThe vestibular sense contributes to our ability to maintain balance and body posture.

Proprioceptive andkinesthetic information travels to the brain via the spinal column.

According to this principle, we tend to segment ourvisual world into figure and ground. Figure is the object or person that is the focus of the visual field, while theground is the background. As Figure 5.25 shows, our perception can vary tremendously, depending on what isperceived as figure and what is perceived as ground. Presumably, our ability to interpret sensory informationdepends on what we label as figure and what we label as ground in any particular case, although thisassumption has been called into question (Peterson & Gibson, 1994; Vecera & O\u2019Reilly, 1998).FIGURE 5.25 The concept of figure-ground relationship explains why this image can be perceived either as a vaseor as a pair of faces.Another Gestalt principle for organizing sensory stimuli into meaningful perception is proximity. Thisprinciple asserts that things that are close to one another tend to be grouped together, as Figure 5.26illustrates.FIGURE 5.26 The Gestalt principle of proximity suggests that you see (a) one block of dots on the left side and (b)three columns on the right side.How we read something provides another illustration of the proximity concept. For example, we read thissentence like this, notl iket hiso rt hat. We group the letters of a given word together because there are nospaces between the letters, and we perceive words because there are spaces between each word. Here aresome more examples: Cany oum akes enseo ft hiss entence? What doth es e wor dsmea n?We might also use the principle of similarity to group things in our visual fields. According to this principle,things that are alike tend to be grouped together (Figure 5.27). For example, when watching a football game, wetend to group individuals based on the colors of their uniforms. When watching an offensive drive, we can get a"

We are grouping thesedots according to the principle of similarity.Two additional Gestalt principles are the law of continuity (or good continuation) and closure. The law ofcontinuity suggests that we are more likely to perceive continuous, smooth flowing lines rather than jagged,broken lines (Figure 5.28). The principle of closure states that we organize our perceptions into completeobjects rather than as a series of parts (Figure 5.29).FIGURE 5.28 Good continuation would suggest that we are more likely to perceive this as two overlapping lines,rather than four lines meeting in the center.FIGURE 5.29 Closure suggests that we will perceive a complete circle and rectangle rather than a series ofsegments."

You probably feel fairly certain that yourperception accurately matches the real world, but this is not always the case. Our perceptions are based onperceptual hypotheses: educated guesses that we make while interpreting sensory information. Thesehypotheses are informed by a number of factors, including our personalities, experiences, and expectations.We use these hypotheses to generate our perceptual set. For instance, research has demonstrated that thosewho are given verbal priming produce a biased interpretation of complex ambiguous figures (Goolkasian &Woodbury, 2010).DIG DEEPERThe Depths of Perception: Bias, Prejudice, and Cultural FactorsIn this chapter, you have learned that perception is a complex process. Built from sensations, but influenced byour own experiences, biases, prejudices, and cultures, perceptions can be very different from person to person.Research suggests that implicit racial prejudice and stereotypes affect perception. For instance, several studieshave demonstrated that non-Black participants identify weapons faster and are more likely to identify non-weapons as weapons when the image of the weapon is paired with the image of a Black person (Payne, 2001;Payne, Shimizu, & Jacoby, 2005). Furthermore, White individuals\u2019 decisions to shoot an armed target in a videogame is made more quickly when the target is Black (Correll, Park, Judd, & Wittenbrink, 2002; Correll, Urland, &Ito, 2006). This research is important, considering the number of very high-profile cases in the last few decadesin which Black people were killed by people who claimed to believe that the unarmed individuals were armedand/or represented some threat to their personal safety."

All sensory systems have both absolute anddifference thresholds, which refer to the minimum amount of stimulus energy or the minimum amount ofdifference in stimulus energy required to be detected about 50% of the time, respectively. Sensory adaptation,selective attention, and signal detection theory can help explain what is perceived and what is not.

The fovea contains cones that possess high levels ofvisual acuity and operate best in bright light conditions. Rods are located throughout the retina and operatebest under dim light conditions. Visual information leaves the eye via the optic nerve. Information from eachvisual field is sent to the opposite side of the brain at the optic chiasm. Visual information then moves througha number of brain sites before reaching the occipital lobe, where it is processed.Two theories explain color perception. The trichromatic theory asserts that three distinct cone groups aretuned to slightly different wavelengths of light, and it is the combination of activity across these cone types thatresults in our perception of all the colors we see. The opponent-process theory of color vision asserts that coloris processed in opponent pairs and accounts for the interesting phenomenon of a negative afterimage.

As the ossicles move, the stapes presses against the oval window of the cochlea, which causes fluidinside the cochlea to move. As a result, hair cells embedded in the basilar membrane become enlarged, whichsends neural impulses to the brain via the auditory nerve.Pitch perception and sound localization are important aspects of hearing. Our ability to perceive pitch relieson both the firing rate of the hair cells in the basilar membrane as well as their location within the membrane.In terms of sound localization, both monaural and binaural cues are used to locate where sounds originate inour environment.Individuals can be born deaf, or they can develop deafness as a result of age, genetic predisposition, and/orenvironmental causes.

        "data": "LEARNING OBJECTIVESBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\u2022 Explain how learned behaviors are different from instincts and reflexes\u2022 Define learning\u2022 Recognize and define three basic forms of learning\u2014classical conditioning, operant conditioning, andobservational learningBirds build nests and migrate as winter approaches. Infants suckle for nurishment. Dogs shake water off wetfur. Salmon swim upstream to spawn, and spiders spin intricate webs. What do these seemingly unrelatedbehaviors have in common? They all are unlearnedbehaviors. Both instincts and reflexes are innate(unlearned) behaviors that organisms are born with. Reflexes are a motor or neural reaction to a specificstimulus in the environment. They tend to be simpler than instincts, involve the activity of specific body partsand systems (e.g., the knee-jerk reflex and the contraction of the pupil in bright light), and involve moreprimitive centers of the central nervous system (e.g., the spinal cord and the medulla). In contrast, instinctsare innate behaviors that are triggered by a broader range of events, such as maturation and the change ofseasons. They are more complex patterns of behavior, involve movement of the organism as a whole (e.g.,sexual activity and migration), and involve higher brain centers.Both reflexes and instincts help an organism adapt to its environment and do not have to be learned. Forexample, every healthy human baby has a sucking reflex, present at birth. Babies are born knowing how tosuck on a nipple, whether artificial (from a bottle) or human. Nobody teaches the baby to suck, just as no oneteaches a sea turtle hatchling to move toward the ocean. Learning, like reflexes and instincts, allows anorganism to adapt to its environment. But unlike instincts and reflexes, learned behaviors involve change andexperience: learning is a relatively permanent change in behavior or knowledge that results from experience.In contrast to the innate behaviors discussed above, learning involves acquiring knowledge and skills throughexperience. Looking back at our surfing scenario, Julian will have to spend much more time training with hissurfboard before he learns how to ride the waves like his father.Learning to surf, as well as any complex learning process (e.g., learning about the discipline of psychology),involves a complex interaction of conscious and unconscious processes. Learning has traditionally beenstudied in terms of its simplest components\u2014the associations our minds automatically make between events.Our minds have a natural tendency to connect events that occur closely together or in sequence. Associativelearning occurs when an organism makes connections between stimuli or events that occur together in theenvironment. You will see that associative learning is central to all three basic learning processes discussed inthis chapter; classical conditioning tends to involve unconscious processes, operant conditioning tends toinvolve conscious processes, and observational learning adds social and cognitive layers to all the basicassociative processes, both conscious and unconscious. These learning processes will be discussed in detaillater in the chapter, but it is helpful to have a brief overview of each as you begin to explore how learning isunderstood from a psychological perspective.In classical conditioning, also known as Pavlovian conditioning, organisms learn to associate events\u2014orstimuli\u2014that repeatedly happen together. We experience this process throughout our daily lives. For example,you might see a flash of lightning in the sky during a storm and then hear a loud boom of thunder. The sound ofthe thunder naturally makes you jump (loud noises have that effect by reflex). Because lightning reliablypredicts the impending boom of thunder, you may associate the two and jump when you see lightning.Psychological researchers study this associative process by focusing on what can be seen andmeasured\u2014behaviors. Researchers ask if one stimulus triggers a reflex, can we train a different stimulus totrigger that same reflex? In operant conditioning, organisms learn, again, to associate events\u2014a behavior andits consequence (reinforcement or punishment). A pleasant consequence encourages more of that behavior inthe future, whereas a punishment deters the behavior. Imagine you are teaching your dog, Hodor, to sit. You"

Conversely, if the dog is punished when exhibiting a behavior, it becomes conditioned to avoidthat behavior (e.g., receiving a small shock when crossing the boundary of an invisible electric fence).6.2 \u2022 Classical Conditioning 183FIGURE 6.2 In operant conditioning, a response is associated with a consequence. This dog has learned thatcertain behaviors result in receiving a treat. (credit: Crystal Rolfe)Observational learning extends the effective range of both classical and operant conditioning. In contrast toclassical and operant conditioning, in which learning occurs only through direct experience, observationallearning is the process of watching others and then imitating what they do. A lot of learning among humansand other animals comes from observational learning. To get an idea of the extra effective range thatobservational learning brings, consider Ben and his son Julian from the introduction. How might observationhelp Julian learn to surf, as opposed to learning by trial and error alone? By watching his father, he can imitatethe moves that bring success and avoid the moves that lead to failure. Can you think of something you havelearned how to do after watching someone else?All of the approaches covered in this chapter are part of a particular tradition in psychology, calledbehaviorism, which we discuss in the next section. However, these approaches do not represent the entirestudy of learning. Separate traditions of learning have taken shape within different fields of psychology, suchas memory and cognition, so you will find that other chapters will round out your understanding of the topic.Over time these traditions tend to converge. For example, in this chapter you will see how cognition has cometo play a larger role in behaviorism, whose more extreme adherents once insisted that behaviors are triggeredby the environment with no intervening thought."

Pavlov was a physiologist,not a psychologist. Physiologists study the life processes of organisms, from the molecular level to the level ofcells, organ systems, and entire organisms. Pavlov\u2019s area of interest was the digestive system (Hunt, 2007). Inhis studies with dogs, Pavlov measured the amount of saliva produced in response to various foods. Over time,Pavlov (1927) observed that the dogs began to salivate not only at the taste of food, but also at the sight of food,at the sight of an empty food bowl, and even at the sound of the laboratory assistants' footsteps. Salivating tofood in the mouth is reflexive, so no learning is involved. However, dogs don\u2019t naturally salivate at the sight ofan empty bowl or the sound of footsteps.These unusual responses intrigued Pavlov, and he wondered what accounted for what he called the dogs'\u201cpsychic secretions\u201d (Pavlov, 1927). To explore this phenomenon in an objective manner, Pavlov designed aseries of carefully controlled experiments to see which stimuli would cause the dogs to salivate. He was able totrain the dogs to salivate in response to stimuli that clearly had nothing to do with food, such as the sound of abell, a light, and a touch on the leg. Through his experiments, Pavlov realized that an organism has two types ofresponses to its environment: (1) unconditioned (unlearned) responses, or reflexes, and (2) conditioned(learned) responses.In Pavlov\u2019s experiments, the dogs salivated each time meat powder was presented to them. The meat powderin this situation was an unconditioned stimulus (UCS): a stimulus that elicits a reflexive response in anorganism. The dogs\u2019 salivation was an unconditioned response (UCR): a natural (unlearned) reaction to agiven stimulus. Before conditioning, think of the dogs\u2019 stimulus and response like this:In classical conditioning, a neutral stimulus is presented immediately before an unconditioned stimulus.Pavlov would sound a tone (like ringing a bell) and then give the dogs the meat powder (Figure 6.4). The tonewas the neutral stimulus (NS), which is a stimulus that does not naturally elicit a response. Prior toconditioning, the dogs did not salivate when they just heard the tone because the tone had no association forthe dogs.When Pavlov paired the tone with the meat powder over and over again, the previously neutral stimulus (thetone) also began to elicit salivation from the dogs. Thus, the neutral stimulus became the conditionedstimulus (CS), which is a stimulus that elicits a response after repeatedly being paired with an unconditionedstimulus. Eventually, the dogs began to salivate to the tone alone, just as they previously had salivated at thesound of the assistants\u2019 footsteps. The behavior caused by the conditioned stimulus is called the conditionedresponse (CR). In the case of Pavlov\u2019s dogs, they had learned to associate the tone (CS) with being fed, and theybegan to salivate (CR) in anticipation of food."

Consider the case of Moisha, who was diagnosed withcancer. When she received her first chemotherapy treatment, she vomited shortly after the chemicals wereinjected. In fact, every trip to the doctor for chemotherapy treatment shortly after the drugs were injected, shevomited. Moisha\u2019s treatment was a success and her cancer went into remission. Now, when she visits heroncologist's office every 6 months for a check-up, she becomes nauseous. In this case, the chemotherapy drugsare the unconditioned stimulus (UCS), vomiting is the unconditioned response (UCR), the doctor\u2019s office is theconditioned stimulus (CS) after being paired with the UCS, and nausea is the conditioned response (CR). Let'sassume that the chemotherapy drugs that Moisha takes are given through a syringe injection. After enteringthe doctor's office, Moisha sees a syringe, and then gets her medication. In addition to the doctor's office,Moisha will learn to associate the syringe with the medication and will respond to syringes with nausea. This isan example of higher-order (or second-order) conditioning, when the conditioned stimulus (the doctor's office)serves to condition another stimulus (the syringe). It is hard to achieve anything above second-orderconditioning. For example, if someone rang a bell every time Moisha received a syringe injection ofchemotherapy drugs in the doctor's office, Moisha likely will never get sick in response to the bell.Consider another example of classical conditioning. Let\u2019s say you have a cat named Tiger, who is quite spoiled.You keep her food in a separate cabinet, and you also have a special electric can opener that you use only toopen cans of cat food. For every meal, Tiger hears the distinctive sound of the electric can opener (\u201czzhzhz\u201d)and then gets her food. Tiger quickly learns that when she hears \u201czzhzhz\u201d she is about to get fed. What do youthink Tiger does when she hears the electric can opener? She will likely get excited and run to where you are"

In that case, Tiger hears \u201csqueak\u201d (the cabinet),\u201czzhzhz\u201d (the electric can opener), and then she gets her food. Tiger will learn to get excited when she hearsthe \u201csqueak\u201d of the cabinet. Pairing a new neutral stimulus (\u201csqueak\u201d) with the conditioned stimulus(\u201czzhzhz\u201d) is called higher-order conditioning, or second-order conditioning. This means you are using theconditioned stimulus of the can opener to condition another stimulus: the squeaky cabinet (Figure 6.5). It ishard to achieve anything above second-order conditioning. For example, if you ring a bell, open the cabinet(\u201csqueak\u201d), use the can opener (\u201czzhzhz\u201d), and then feed Tiger, Tiger will likely never get excited when hearingthe bell alone.FIGURE 6.5 In higher-order conditioning, an established conditioned stimulus is paired with a new neutral stimulus(the second-order stimulus), so that eventually the new stimulus also elicits the conditioned response, without theinitial conditioned stimulus being presented.Classical Conditioning at Stingray CityKate and her spouse recently vacationed in the Cayman Islands, and booked a boat tour to Stingray City, wherethey could feed and swim with the southern stingrays.

Bythe late 1980s, word of the large group of stingrays spread among scuba divers, who then started feeding themby hand. Over time, the southern stingrays in the area were classically conditioned much like Pavlov\u2019s dogs.When they hear the sound of a boat engine (neutral stimulus that becomes a conditioned stimulus), they knowthat they will get to eat (conditioned response).As soon as they reached Stingray City, over two dozen stingrays surrounded their tour boat. The couple slippedinto the water with bags of squid, the stingrays\u2019 favorite treat. The swarm of stingrays bumped and rubbed upagainst their legs like hungry cats (Figure 6.6).

These stingrays have beenclassically conditioned to associate the sound of a boat motor with food provided by tourists. (credit: KathrynDumper)Classical conditioning also applies to humans, even babies. For example, Elan buys formula in blue canistersfor their six-month-old daughter, Angelina. Whenever Elan takes out a formula container, Angelina getsexcited, tries to reach toward the food, and most likely salivates. Why does Angelina get excited when she seesthe formula canister? What are the UCS, CS, UCR, and CR here?So far, all of the examples have involved food, but classical conditioning extends beyond the basic need to befed. Consider our earlier example of a dog whose owners install an invisible electric dog fence. A smallelectrical shock (unconditioned stimulus) elicits discomfort (unconditioned response). When theunconditioned stimulus (shock) is paired with a neutral stimulus (the edge of a yard), the dog associates thediscomfort (unconditioned response) with the edge of the yard (conditioned stimulus) and stays within the setboundaries. In this example, the edge of the yard elicits fear and anxiety in the dog. Fear and anxiety are theconditioned response.LINK TO LEARNINGWatch this video clip from the television show, The Office, for a humorous look at conditioning(http://openstax.org/l/theoffice) in which Jim conditions Dwight to expect a breath mint every time Jim\u2019scomputer makes a specific sound."

In classical conditioning, the initial period of learning is known asacquisition, when an organism learns to connect a neutral stimulus and an unconditioned stimulus. Duringacquisition, the neutral stimulus begins to elicit the conditioned response, and eventually the neutral stimulusbecomes a conditioned stimulus capable of eliciting the conditioned response by itself. Timing is important forconditioning to occur. Typically, there should only be a brief interval between presentation of the conditionedstimulus and the unconditioned stimulus. Depending on what is being conditioned, sometimes this interval isas little as five seconds (Chance, 2009). However, with other types of conditioning, the interval can be up toseveral hours.Taste aversion is a type of conditioning in which an interval of several hours may pass between theconditioned stimulus (something ingested) and the unconditioned stimulus (nausea or illness). Here\u2019s how itworks. Between classes, you and a friend grab a quick lunch from a food cart on campus. You share a dish ofchicken curry and head off to your next class. A few hours later, you feel nauseous and become ill. Althoughyour friend is fine and you determine that you have intestinal flu (the food is not the culprit), you\u2019ve developeda taste aversion; the next time you are at a restaurant and someone orders curry, you immediately feel ill.While the chicken dish is not what made you sick, you are experiencing taste aversion: you\u2019ve beenconditioned to be averse to a food after a single, bad experience.How does this occur\u2014conditioning based on a single instance and involving an extended time lapse betweenthe event and the negative stimulus? Research into taste aversion suggests that this response may be anevolutionary adaptation designed to help organisms quickly learn to avoid harmful foods (Garcia & Rusiniak,1980; Garcia & Koelling, 1966). Not only may this contribute to species survival via natural selection, but itmay also help us develop strategies for challenges such as helping cancer patients through the nausea inducedby certain treatments (Holmes, 1993; Jacobsen et al., 1993; Hutton, Baracos, & Wismer, 2007; Skolin et al.,2006). Garcia and Koelling (1966) showed not only that taste aversions could be conditioned, but also thatthere were biological constraints to learning. In their study, separate groups of rats were conditioned toassociate either a flavor with illness, or lights and sounds with illness. Results showed that all rats exposed toflavor-illness pairings learned to avoid the flavor, but none of the rats exposed to lights and sounds with illnesslearned to avoid lights or sounds. This added evidence to the idea that classical conditioning could contributeto species survival by helping organisms learn to avoid stimuli that posed real dangers to health and welfare.Robert Rescorla demonstrated how powerfully an organism can learn to predict the UCS from the CS. Take, forexample, the following two situations. Ari\u2019s dad always has dinner on the table every day at 6:00. Soraya\u2019s momswitches it up so that some days they eat dinner at 6:00, some days they eat at 5:00, and other days they eat at7:00. For Ari, 6:00 reliably and consistently predicts dinner, so Ari will likely start feeling hungry every dayright before 6:00, even if he's had a late snack. Soraya, on the other hand, will be less likely to associate 6:00with dinner, since 6:00 does not always predict that dinner is coming. Rescorla, along with his colleague at YaleUniversity, Alan Wagner, developed a mathematical formula that could be used to calculate the probability thatan association would be learned given the ability of a conditioned stimulus to predict the occurrence of anunconditioned stimulus and other factors; today this is known as the Rescorla-Wagner model (Rescorla &Wagner, 1972)Once we have established the connection between the unconditioned stimulus and the conditioned stimulus,how do we break that connection and get the dog, cat, or child to stop responding? In Tiger\u2019s case, imaginewhat would happen if you stopped using the electric can opener for her food and began to use it only forhuman food. Now, Tiger would hear the can opener, but she would not get food. In classical conditioning terms,you would be giving the conditioned stimulus, but not the unconditioned stimulus. Pavlov explored thisscenario in his experiments with dogs: sounding the tone without giving the dogs the meat powder. Soon thedogs stopped responding to the tone.

When presented with theconditioned stimulus alone, the dog, cat, or other organism would show a weaker and weaker response, andfinally no response. In classical conditioning terms, there is a gradual weakening and disappearance of theconditioned response.What happens when learning is not used for a while\u2014when what was learned lies dormant? As we justdiscussed, Pavlov found that when he repeatedly presented the bell (conditioned stimulus) without the meatpowder (unconditioned stimulus), extinction occurred; the dogs stopped salivating to the bell. However, after acouple of hours of resting from this extinction training, the dogs again began to salivate when Pavlov rang thebell. What do you think would happen with Tiger\u2019s behavior if your electric can opener broke, and you did notuse it for several months? When you finally got it fixed and started using it to open Tiger\u2019s food again, Tigerwould remember the association between the can opener and her food\u2014she would get excited and run to thekitchen when she heard the sound. The behavior of Pavlov\u2019s dogs and Tiger illustrates a concept Pavlov calledspontaneous recovery: the return of a previously extinguished conditioned response following a rest period(Figure 6.7).FIGURE 6.7 This is the curve of acquisition, extinction, and spontaneous recovery. The rising curve shows theconditioned response quickly getting stronger through the repeated pairing of the conditioned stimulus and theunconditioned stimulus (acquisition). Then the curve decreases, which shows how the conditioned responseweakens when only the conditioned stimulus is presented (extinction). After a break or pause from conditioning, theconditioned response reappears (spontaneous recovery).Of course, these processes also apply in humans. For example, let\u2019s say that every day when you walk tocampus, an ice cream truck passes your route. Day after day, you hear the truck\u2019s music (neutral stimulus), soyou finally stop and purchase a chocolate ice cream bar. You take a bite (unconditioned stimulus) and thenyour mouth waters (unconditioned response). This initial period of learning is known as acquisition, when youbegin to connect the neutral stimulus (the sound of the truck) and the unconditioned stimulus (the taste of thechocolate ice cream in your mouth). During acquisition, the conditioned response gets stronger and strongerthrough repeated pairings of the conditioned stimulus and unconditioned stimulus. Several days (and icecream bars) later, you notice that your mouth begins to water (conditioned response) as soon as you hear thetruck\u2019s musical jingle\u2014even before you bite into the ice cream bar. Then one day you head down the street. Youhear the truck\u2019s music (conditioned stimulus), and your mouth waters (conditioned response). However, whenyou get to the truck, you discover that they are all out of ice cream. You leave disappointed. The next few daysyou pass by the truck and hear the music, but don\u2019t stop to get an ice cream bar because you\u2019re running late forclass. You begin to salivate less and less when you hear the music, until by the end of the week, your mouth nolonger waters when you hear the tune. This illustrates extinction. The conditioned response weakens whenonly the conditioned stimulus (the sound of the truck) is presented, without being followed by theunconditioned stimulus (chocolate ice cream in the mouth).

What do you think happens? Your mouth begins to water again.Why? After a break from conditioning, the conditioned response reappears, which indicates spontaneousrecovery.Acquisition and extinction involve the strengthening and weakening, respectively, of a learned association.Two other learning processes\u2014stimulus discrimination and stimulus generalization\u2014are involved indetermining which stimuli will trigger learned responses. Animals (including humans) need to distinguishbetween stimuli\u2014for example, between sounds that predict a threatening event and sounds that do not\u2014so thatthey can respond appropriately (such as running away if the sound is threatening). When an organism learnsto respond differently to various stimuli that are similar, it is called stimulus discrimination. In classicalconditioning terms, the organism demonstrates the conditioned response only to the conditioned stimulus.Pavlov\u2019s dogs discriminated between the basic tone that sounded before they were fed and other tones (e.g.,the doorbell), because the other sounds did not predict the arrival of food. Similarly, Tiger, the cat,discriminated between the sound of the can opener and the sound of the electric mixer. When the electricmixer is going, Tiger is not about to be fed, so she does not come running to the kitchen looking for food. In ourother example, Moisha, the cancer patient, discriminated between oncologists and other types of doctors. Shelearned not to feel ill when visiting doctors for other types of appointments, such as her annual physical.On the other hand, when an organism demonstrates the conditioned response to stimuli that are similar to thecondition stimulus, it is called stimulus generalization, the opposite of stimulus discrimination. The moresimilar a stimulus is to the condition stimulus, the more likely the organism is to give the conditionedresponse. For instance, if the electric mixer sounds very similar to the electric can opener, Tiger may comerunning after hearing its sound. But if you do not feed her following the electric mixer sound, and you continueto feed her consistently after the electric can opener sound, she will quickly learn to discriminate between thetwo sounds (provided they are sufficiently dissimilar that she can tell them apart). In our other example,Moisha continued to feel ill whenever visiting other oncologists or other doctors in the same building as heroncologist.BehaviorismJohn B. Watson, shown in Figure 6.8, is considered the founder of behaviorism. Behaviorism is a school ofthought that arose during the first part of the 20th century, which incorporates elements of Pavlov\u2019s classicalconditioning (Hunt, 2007). In stark contrast with Freud, who considered the reasons for behavior to be hiddenin the unconscious, Watson championed the idea that all behavior can be studied as a simple stimulus-response reaction, without regard for internal processes. Watson argued that in order for psychology tobecome a legitimate science, it must shift its concern away from internal mental processes because mentalprocesses cannot be seen or measured. Instead, he asserted that psychology must focus on outwardobservable behavior that can be measured."

Watson used the principles of classical conditioning in the study of human emotion.Watson\u2019s ideas were influenced by Pavlov\u2019s work. According to Watson, human behavior, just like animalbehavior, is primarily the result of conditioned responses. Whereas Pavlov\u2019s work with dogs involved theconditioning of reflexes, Watson believed the same principles could be extended to the conditioning of humanemotions (Watson, 1919).In 1920, while chair of the psychology department at Johns Hopkins University, Watson and his graduatestudent, Rosalie Rayner, conducted research on a baby nicknamed Little Albert. Rayner and Watson\u2019sexperiments with Little Albert demonstrated how fears can be conditioned using classical conditioning.Through these experiments, Little Albert was exposed to and conditioned to fear certain things. Initially he waspresented with various neutral stimuli, including a rabbit, a dog, a monkey, masks, cotton wool, and a whiterat. He was not afraid of any of these things. Then Watson, with the help of Rayner, conditioned Little Albert toassociate these stimuli with an emotion\u2014fear. For example, Watson handed Little Albert the white rat, andLittle Albert enjoyed playing with it. Then Watson made a loud sound, by striking a hammer against a metalbar hanging behind Little Albert\u2019s head, each time Little Albert touched the rat. Little Albert was frightened bythe sound\u2014demonstrating a reflexive fear of sudden loud noises\u2014and began to cry. Watson repeatedly pairedthe loud sound with the white rat. Soon Little Albert became frightened by the white rat alone. In this case,what are the UCS, CS, UCR, and CR? Days later, Little Albert demonstrated stimulus generalization\u2014he becameafraid of other furry things: a rabbit, a furry coat, and even a Santa Claus mask (Figure 6.9). Watson hadsucceeded in conditioning a fear response in Little Albert, thus demonstrating that emotions could becomeconditioned responses. It had been Watson\u2019s intention to produce a phobia\u2014a persistent, excessive fear of aspecific object or situation\u2014 through conditioning alone, thus countering Freud\u2019s view that phobias are causedby deep, hidden conflicts in the mind. However, there is no evidence that Little Albert experienced phobias inlater years. Little Albert\u2019s mother moved away, ending the experiment. While Watson\u2019s research provided newinsight into conditioning, it would be considered unethical by today\u2019s standards.FIGURE 6.9 Through stimulus generalization, Little Albert came to fear furry things, including Watson in a SantaClaus mask."

Think about the carcommercials you have seen on television. Many of them feature an attractive model. By associating the modelwith the car being advertised, you come to see the car as being desirable (Cialdini, 2008). You may be askingyourself, does this advertising technique actually work? According to Cialdini (2008), men who viewed a carcommercial that included an attractive model later rated the car as being faster, more appealing, and betterdesigned than did men who viewed an advertisement for the same car minus the model.Have you ever noticed how quickly advertisers cancel contracts with a famous athlete following a scandal? As faras the advertiser is concerned, that athlete is no longer associated with positive feelings; therefore, the athletecannot be used as an unconditioned stimulus to condition the public to associate positive feelings (theunconditioned response) with their product (the conditioned stimulus).Now that you are aware of how associative learning works, see if you can find examples of these types ofadvertisements on television, in magazines, or on the Internet."

Remember that in classical conditioning, something in the environment triggers a reflexautomatically, and researchers train the organism to react to a different stimulus. Now we turn to the secondtype of associative learning, operant conditioning. In operant conditioning, organisms learn to associate abehavior and its consequence (Table 6.1). A pleasant consequence makes that behavior more likely to berepeated in the future. For example, Spirit, a dolphin at the National Aquarium in Baltimore, does a flip in theair when her trainer blows a whistle. The consequence is that she gets a fish."

F. Skinner saw that classical conditioning is limited to existing behaviors that are reflexivelyelicited, and it doesn\u2019t account for new behaviors such as riding a bike. He proposed a theory about how suchbehaviors come about. Skinner believed that behavior is motivated by the consequences we receive for thebehavior: the reinforcements and punishments. His idea that learning is the result of consequences is basedon the law of effect, which was first proposed by psychologist Edward Thorndike. According to the law ofeffect, behaviors that are followed by consequences that are satisfying to the organism are more likely to berepeated, and behaviors that are followed by unpleasant consequences are less likely to be repeated(Thorndike, 1911). Essentially, if an organism does something that brings about a desired result, the organismis more likely to do it again. If an organism does something that does not bring about a desired result, theorganism is less likely to do it again. An example of the law of effect is in employment. One of the reasons (andoften the main reason) we show up for work is because we get paid to do so. If we stop getting paid, we willlikely stop showing up\u2014even if we love our job.Working with Thorndike\u2019s law of effect as his foundation, Skinner began conducting scientific experiments onanimals (mainly rats and pigeons) to determine how organisms learn through operant conditioning (Skinner,1938). He placed these animals inside an operant conditioning chamber, which has come to be known as a\u201cSkinner box\u201d (Figure 6.10). A Skinner box contains a lever (for rats) or disk (for pigeons) that the animal canpress or peck for a food reward via the dispenser. Speakers and lights can be associated with certain behaviors.A recorder counts the number of responses made by the animal.FIGURE 6.10 (a) B. F. Skinner developed operant conditioning for systematic study of how behaviors arestrengthened or weakened according to their consequences.

In operant conditioning, positive and negative do not mean good andbad. Instead, positivemeans you are adding something, and negativemeans you are taking something away.Reinforcementmeans you are increasing a behavior, and punishmentmeans you are decreasing a behavior.Reinforcement can be positive or negative, and punishment can also be positive or negative. All reinforcers(positive or negative) increasethe likelihood of a behavioral response. All punishers (positive or negative)decreasethe likelihood of a behavioral response. Now let\u2019s combine these four terms: positive reinforcement,negative reinforcement, positive punishment, and negative punishment (Table 6.2).Positive and Negative Reinforcement and PunishmentReinforcementPunishmentPositiveSomething is addedto increasethe likelihood of abehavior.Something is addedto decreasethe likelihood of abehavior.NegativeSomething is removedto increasethe likelihoodof a behavior.Something is removedto decreasethe likelihoodof a behavior.TABLE 6.2ReinforcementThe most effective way to teach a person or animal a new behavior is with positive reinforcement. In positivereinforcement, a desirable stimulus is added to increase a behavior.For example, you tell your five-year-old son, Jerome, that if he cleans his room, he will get a toy. Jerome quicklycleans his room because he wants a new art set. Let\u2019s pause for a moment. Some people might say, \u201cWhyshould I reward my child for doing what is expected?\u201d But in fact we are constantly and consistently rewardedin our lives. Our paychecks are rewards, as are high grades and acceptance into our preferred school. Beingpraised for doing a good job and for passing a driver\u2019s test is also a reward. Positive reinforcement as alearning tool is extremely effective. It has been found that one of the most effective ways to increaseachievement in school districts with below-average reading scores was to pay the children to read. Specifically,second-grade students in Dallas were paid $2 each time they read a book and passed a short quiz about thebook. The result was a significant increase in reading comprehension (Fryer, 2010). What do you think aboutthis program? If Skinner were alive today, he would probably think this was a great idea. He was a strongproponent of using operant conditioning principles to influence students\u2019 behavior at school. In fact, inaddition to the Skinner box, he also invented what he called a teaching machine that was designed to rewardsmall steps in learning (Skinner, 1961)\u2014an early forerunner of computer-assisted learning. His teachingmachine tested students\u2019 knowledge as they worked through various school subjects. If students answeredquestions correctly, they received immediate positive reinforcement and could continue; if they answeredincorrectly, they did not receive any reinforcement. The idea was that students would spend additional timestudying the material to increase their chance of being reinforced the next time (Skinner, 1961).In negative reinforcement, an undesirable stimulus is removed to increase a behavior. For example, carmanufacturers use the principles of negative reinforcement in their seatbelt systems, which go \u201cbeep, beep,beep\u201d until you fasten your seatbelt. The annoying sound stops when you exhibit the desired behavior,"

Riders apply pressure\u2014by pulling the reins or squeezing their legs\u2014and then remove thepressure when the horse performs the desired behavior, such as turning or speeding up. The pressure is thenegative stimulus that the horse wants to remove.PunishmentMany people confuse negative reinforcement with punishment in operant conditioning, but they are two verydifferent mechanisms. Remember that reinforcement, even when it is negative, always increases a behavior. Incontrast, punishment always decreases a behavior. In positive punishment, you add an undesirable stimulusto decrease a behavior. An example of positive punishment is scolding a student to get the student to stoptexting in class. In this case, a stimulus (the reprimand) is added in order to decrease the behavior (texting inclass). In negative punishment, you remove a pleasant stimulus to decrease behavior. For example, when achild misbehaves, a parent can take away a favorite toy. In this case, a stimulus (the toy) is removed in order todecrease the behavior.Punishment, especially when it is immediate, is one way to decrease undesirable behavior. For example,imagine your four-year-old son, Brandon, hit his younger brother. You have Brandon write 100 times \u201cI will nothit my brother\" (positive punishment). Chances are he won\u2019t repeat this behavior. While strategies like this arecommon today, in the past children were often subject to physical punishment, such as spanking. It\u2019simportant to be aware of some of the drawbacks in using physical punishment on children. First, punishmentmay teach fear. Brandon may become fearful of the street, but he also may become fearful of the person whodelivered the punishment\u2014you, his parent. Similarly, children who are punished by teachers may come to fearthe teacher and try to avoid school (Gershoff et al., 2010). Consequently, most schools in the United States havebanned corporal punishment. Second, punishment may cause children to become more aggressive and proneto antisocial behavior and delinquency (Gershoff, 2002). They see their parents resort to spanking when theybecome angry and frustrated, so, in turn, they may act out this same behavior when they become angry andfrustrated. For example, because you spank Brenda when you are angry with her for her misbehavior, shemight start hitting her friends when they won\u2019t share their toys.While positive punishment can be effective in some cases, Skinner suggested that the use of punishmentshould be weighed against the possible negative effects. Today\u2019s psychologists and parenting experts favorreinforcement over punishment\u2014they recommend that you catch your child doing something good and rewardthem for it.ShapingIn his operant conditioning experiments, Skinner often used an approach called shaping. Instead of rewardingonly the target behavior, in shaping, we reward successive approximations of a target behavior. Why is shapingneeded? Remember that in order for reinforcement to work, the organism must first display the behavior.Shaping is needed because it is extremely unlikely that an organism will display anything but the simplest ofbehaviors spontaneously. In shaping, behaviors are broken down into many small, achievable steps. Thespecific steps used in the process are the following:1. Reinforce any response that resembles the desired behavior.2. Then reinforce the response that more closely resembles the desired behavior. You will no longer reinforcethe previously reinforced response.3. Next, begin to reinforce the response that even more closely resembles the desired behavior.4. Continue to reinforce closer and closer approximations of the desired behavior.5. Finally, only reinforce the desired behavior.Shaping is often used in teaching a complex behavior or chain of behaviors. Skinner used shaping to teachpigeons not only such relatively simple behaviors as pecking a disk in a Skinner box, but also many unusualand entertaining behaviors, such as turning in circles, walking in figure eights, and even playing ping pong; the"

Recall Pavlov\u2019s dogs\u2014he trained them to respond to the tone of a bell, and not to similar tonesor sounds. This discrimination is also important in operant conditioning and in shaping behavior.LINK TO LEARNINGWatch this brief video of Skinner's pigeons playing ping pong (http://openstax.org/l/pingpong) to learn more.It\u2019s easy to see how shaping is effective in teaching behaviors to animals, but how does shaping work withhumans? Let\u2019s consider parents whose goal is to have their child learn to clean his room. They use shaping tohelp him master steps toward the goal. Instead of performing the entire task, they set up these steps andreinforce each step. First, he cleans up one toy. Second, he cleans up five toys. Third, he chooses whether topick up ten toys or put his books and clothes away. Fourth, he cleans up everything except two toys. Finally, hecleans his entire room.Primary and Secondary ReinforcersRewards such as stickers, praise, money, toys, and more can be used to reinforce learning. Let\u2019s go back toSkinner\u2019s rats again. How did the rats learn to press the lever in the Skinner box? They were rewarded withfood each time they pressed the lever. For animals, food would be an obvious reinforcer.What would be a good reinforcer for humans? For your child Chris, it was the promise of a toy when theycleaned their room. How about Sydney, the soccer player? If you gave Sydney a piece of candy every timeSydney scored a goal, you would be using a primary reinforcer. Primary reinforcers are reinforcers that haveinnate reinforcing qualities. These kinds of reinforcers are not learned. Water, food, sleep, shelter, sex, andtouch, among others, are primary reinforcers. Pleasure is also a primary reinforcer. Organisms do not losetheir drive for these things. For most people, jumping in a cool lake on a very hot day would be reinforcing andthe cool lake would be innately reinforcing\u2014the water would cool the person off (a physical need), as well asprovide pleasure.A secondary reinforcer has no inherent value and only has reinforcing qualities when linked with a primaryreinforcer. Praise, linked to affection, is one example of a secondary reinforcer, as when you called out \u201cGreatshot!\u201d every time Sydney made a goal. Another example, money, is only worth something when you can use itto buy other things\u2014either things that satisfy basic needs (food, water, shelter\u2014all primary reinforcers) orother secondary reinforcers. If you were on a remote island in the middle of the Pacific Ocean and you hadstacks of money, the money would not be useful if you could not spend it. What about the stickers on thebehavior chart? They also are secondary reinforcers.Sometimes, instead of stickers on a sticker chart, a token is used. Tokens, which are also secondaryreinforcers, can then be traded in for rewards and prizes. Entire behavior management systems, known astoken economies, are built around the use of these kinds of token reinforcers. Token economies have beenfound to be very effective at modifying behavior in a variety of settings such as schools, prisons, and mentalhospitals. For example, a study by Adibsereshki and Abkenar (2014) found that use of a token economyincreased appropriate social behaviors and reduced inappropriate behaviors in a group of eight gradestudents. Similar studies show demonstrable gains on behavior and academic achievement for groups rangingfrom first grade to high school, and representing a wide array of abilities and disabilities. For example, duringstudies involving younger students, when children in the study exhibited appropriate behavior (not hitting orpinching), they received a \u201cquiet hands\u201d token. When they hit or pinched, they lost a token. The children couldthen exchange specified amounts of tokens for minutes of playtime."

Behavior modification usesthe principles of operant conditioning to accomplish behavior change so that undesirable behaviors are switchedfor more socially acceptable ones. Some teachers and parents create a sticker chart, in which several behaviorsare listed (Figure 6.11). Sticker charts are a form of token economies, as described in the text. Each time childrenperform the behavior, they get a sticker, and after a certain number of stickers, they get a prize, or reinforcer. Thegoal is to increase acceptable behaviors and decrease misbehavior. Remember, it is best to reinforce desiredbehaviors, rather than to use punishment. In the classroom, the teacher can reinforce a wide range of behaviors,from students raising their hands, to walking quietly in the hall, to turning in their homework. At home, parentsmight create a behavior chart that rewards children for things such as putting away toys, brushing their teeth,and helping with dinner. In order for behavior modification to be effective, the reinforcement needs to beconnected with the behavior; the reinforcement must matter to the child and be done consistently.FIGURE 6.11 Sticker charts are a form of positive reinforcement and a tool for behavior modification. Once thischild earns a certain number of stickers for demonstrating a desired behavior, she will be rewarded with a trip tothe ice cream parlor. (credit: Abigail Batchelder)Time-out is another popular technique used in behavior modification with children. It operates on the principle ofnegative punishment. When a child demonstrates an undesirable behavior, they are removed from the desirableactivity at hand (Figure 6.12). For example, say that Sophia and her brother Mario are playing with buildingblocks. Sophia throws some blocks at her brother, so you give her a warning that she will go to time-out if shedoes it again. A few minutes later, she throws more blocks at Mario. You remove Sophia from the room for a fewminutes. When she comes back, she doesn\u2019t throw blocks.There are several important points that you should know if you plan to implement time-out as a behaviormodification technique. First, make sure the child is being removed from a desirable activity and placed in a lessdesirable location. If the activity is something undesirable for the child, this technique will backfire because it ismore enjoyable for the child to be removed from the activity. Second, the length of the time-out is important. Thegeneral rule of thumb is one minute for each year of the child\u2019s age. Sophia is five; therefore, she sits in a time-out for five minutes. Setting a timer helps children know how long they have to sit in time-out. Finally, as acaregiver, keep several guidelines in mind over the course of a time-out: remain calm when directing your child totime-out; ignore your child during time-out (because caregiver attention may reinforce misbehavior); and give thechild a hug or a kind word when time-out is over."

When a child misbehaves,they are removed from a desirable activity in an effort to decrease the unwanted behavior. For example, (a) achild might be playing on the playground with friends and push another child; (b) the child who misbehavedwould then be removed from the activity for a short period of time. (credit a: modification of work by SimoneRamella; credit b: modification of work by \u201cSpring Dew\u201d/Flickr)Reinforcement SchedulesRemember, the best way to teach a person or animal a behavior is to use positive reinforcement. For example,Skinner used positive reinforcement to teach rats to press a lever in a Skinner box. At first, the rat mightrandomly hit the lever while exploring the box, and out would come a pellet of food. After eating the pellet,what do you think the hungry rat did next? It hit the lever again, and received another pellet of food. Each timethe rat hit the lever, a pellet of food came out. When an organism receives a reinforcer each time it displays abehavior, it is called continuous reinforcement. This reinforcement schedule is the quickest way to teachsomeone a behavior, and it is especially effective in training a new behavior. Let\u2019s look back at the dog that waslearning to sit earlier in the chapter. Now, each time he sits, you give him a treat. Timing is important here: youwill be most successful if you present the reinforcer immediately after he sits, so that he can make anassociation between the target behavior (sitting) and the consequence (getting a treat).LINK TO LEARNINGWatch this video clip of veterinarian Dr. Sophia Yin shaping a dog's behavior using the steps outlined above(http://openstax.org/l/sueyin) to learn more.Once a behavior is trained, researchers and trainers often turn to another type of reinforcementschedule\u2014partial reinforcement. In partial reinforcement, also referred to as intermittent reinforcement, theperson or animal does not get reinforced every time they perform the desired behavior. There are severaldifferent types of partial reinforcement schedules (Table 6.3). These schedules are described as either fixed orvariable, and as either interval or ratio. Fixedrefers to the number of responses between reinforcements, orthe amount of time between reinforcements, which is set and unchanging. Variablerefers to the number ofresponses or amount of time between reinforcements, which varies or changes. Intervalmeans the schedule isbased on the time between reinforcements, and ratiomeans the schedule is based on the number of responsesbetween reinforcements."

A fixed interval reinforcement schedule is when behavior is rewardedafter a set amount of time. For example, June undergoes major surgery in a hospital. During recovery, they areexpected to experience pain and will require prescription medications for pain relief. June is given an IV dripwith a patient-controlled painkiller. Their doctor sets a limit: one dose per hour. June pushes a button whenpain becomes difficult, and they receive a dose of medication. Since the reward (pain relief) only occurs on afixed interval, there is no point in exhibiting the behavior when it will not be rewarded.With a variable interval reinforcement schedule, the person or animal gets the reinforcement based onvarying amounts of time, which are unpredictable. Say that Manuel is the manager at a fast-food restaurant.Every once in a while someone from the quality control division comes to Manuel\u2019s restaurant. If the restaurantis clean and the service is fast, everyone on that shift earns a $20 bonus. Manuel never knows when the qualitycontrol person will show up, so he always tries to keep the restaurant clean and ensures that his employeesprovide prompt and courteous service. His productivity regarding prompt service and keeping a cleanrestaurant are steady because he wants his crew to earn the bonus.With a fixed ratio reinforcement schedule, there are a set number of responses that must occur before thebehavior is rewarded. Carla sells glasses at an eyeglass store, and she earns a commission every time she sellsa pair of glasses. She always tries to sell people more pairs of glasses, including prescription sunglasses or abackup pair, so she can increase her commission. She does not care if the person really needs the prescriptionsunglasses, Carla just wants her bonus. The quality of what Carla sells does not matter because hercommission is not based on quality; it\u2019s only based on the number of pairs sold. This distinction in the qualityof performance can help determine which reinforcement method is most appropriate for a particularsituation. Fixed ratios are better suited to optimize the quantity of output, whereas a fixed interval, in whichthe reward is not quantity based, can lead to a higher quality of output.In a variable ratio reinforcement schedule, the number of responses needed for a reward varies. This is themost powerful partial reinforcement schedule. An example of the variable ratio reinforcement schedule is"

She is not agambler, but out of curiosity she puts a quarter into the slot machine, and then another, and another. Nothinghappens. Two dollars in quarters later, her curiosity is fading, and she is just about to quit. But then, themachine lights up, bells go off, and Sarah gets 50 quarters back. That\u2019s more like it! Sarah gets back toinserting quarters with renewed interest, and a few minutes later she has used up all her gains and is $10 inthe hole. Now might be a sensible time to quit. And yet, she keeps putting money into the slot machine becauseshe never knows when the next reinforcement is coming. She keeps thinking that with the next quarter shecould win $50, or $100, or even more. Because the reinforcement schedule in most types of gambling has avariable ratio schedule, people keep trying and hoping that the next time they will win big. This is one of thereasons that gambling is so addictive\u2014and so resistant to extinction.In operant conditioning, extinction of a reinforced behavior occurs at some point after reinforcement stops,and the speed at which this happens depends on the reinforcement schedule. In a variable ratio schedule, thepoint of extinction comes very slowly, as described above. But in the other reinforcement schedules, extinctionmay come quickly. For example, if June presses the button for the pain relief medication before the allottedtime the doctor has approved, no medication is administered. They are on a fixed interval reinforcementschedule (dosed hourly), so extinction occurs quickly when reinforcement doesn\u2019t come at the expected time.Among the reinforcement schedules, variable ratio is the most productive and the most resistant to extinction.Fixed interval is the least productive and the easiest to extinguish (Figure 6.13).FIGURE 6.13 The four reinforcement schedules yield different response patterns. The variable ratio schedule isunpredictable and yields high and steady response rates, with little if any pause after reinforcement (e.g., gambler).A fixed ratio schedule is predictable and produces a high response rate, with a short pause after reinforcement (e.g.,eyeglass saleswoman). The variable interval schedule is unpredictable and produces a moderate, steady responserate (e.g., restaurant manager). The fixed interval schedule yields a scallop-shaped response pattern, reflecting asignificant pause after reinforcement (e.g., surgery patient).CONNECT THE CONCEPTSGambling and the BrainSkinner (1953) stated, \u201cIf the gambling establishment cannot persuade a patron to turn over money with no return,it may achieve the same effect by returning part of the patron's money on a variable-ratio schedule\u201d (p. 397).Skinner uses gambling as an example of the power of the variable-ratio reinforcement schedule for maintainingbehavior even during long periods without any reinforcement. In fact, Skinner was so confident in his knowledge ofgambling addiction that he even claimed he could turn a pigeon into a pathological gambler (\u201cSkinner\u2019s Utopia,\u201d1971). It is indeed true that variable-ratio schedules keep behavior quite persistent\u2014just imagine the frequency of achild\u2019s tantrums if a parent gives in even once to the behavior. The occasional reward makes it almost impossible tostop the behavior.Recent research in rats has failed to support Skinner\u2019s idea that training on variable-ratio schedules alone causes"

However, other research suggests that gambling does seem to workon the brain in the same way as most addictive drugs, and so there may be some combination of brain chemistryand reinforcement schedule that could lead to problem gambling (Figure 6.14). Specifically, modern research showsthe connection between gambling and the activation of the reward centers of the brain that use theneurotransmitter (brain chemical) dopamine (Murch & Clark, 2016). Interestingly, gamblers don\u2019t even have to winto experience the \u201crush\u201d of dopamine in the brain. \u201cNear misses,\u201d or almost winning but not actually winning, alsohave been shown to increase activity in the ventral striatum and other brain reward centers that use dopamine(Chase & Clark, 2010). These brain effects are almost identical to those produced by addictive drugs like cocaineand heroin (Murch & Clark, 2016). Based on the neuroscientific evidence showing these similarities, the DSM-5 nowconsiders gambling an addiction, while earlier versions of the DSM classified gambling as an impulse controldisorder.FIGURE 6.14 Some research suggests that pathological gamblers use gambling to compensate for abnormally lowlevels of the hormone norepinephrine, which is associated with stress and is secreted in moments of arousal andthrill. (credit: Ted Murphy)In addition to dopamine, gambling also appears to involve other neurotransmitters, including norepinephrine andserotonin (Potenza, 2013). Norepinephrine is secreted when a person feels stress, arousal, or thrill. It may be thatpathological gamblers use gambling to increase their levels of this neurotransmitter. Deficiencies in serotonin mightalso contribute to compulsive behavior, including a gambling addiction (Potenza, 2013).It may be that pathological gamblers\u2019 brains are different than those of other people, and perhaps this differencemay somehow have led to their gambling addiction, as these studies seem to suggest. However, it is very difficult toascertain the cause because it is impossible to conduct a true experiment (it would be unethical to try to turnrandomly assigned participants into problem gamblers). Therefore, it may be that causation actually moves in theopposite direction\u2014perhaps the act of gambling somehow changes neurotransmitter levels in some gamblers\u2019brains. It also is possible that some overlooked factor, or confounding variable, played a role in both the gamblingaddiction and the differences in brain chemistry.Cognition and Latent LearningStrict behaviorists like Watson and Skinner focused exclusively on studying behavior rather than cognition(such as thoughts and expectations). In fact, Skinner was such a staunch believer that cognition didn't matterthat his ideas were considered radical behaviorism. Skinner considered the mind a \"black box\"\u2014somethingcompletely unknowable\u2014and, therefore, something not to be studied. However, another behaviorist, Edward C.Tolman, had a different opinion. Tolman\u2019s experiments with rats demonstrated that organisms can learn evenif they do not receive immediate reinforcement (Tolman & Honzik, 1930; Tolman, Ritchie, & Kalish, 1946). Thisfinding was in conflict with the prevailing idea at the time that reinforcement must be immediate in order forlearning to occur, thus suggesting a cognitive aspect to learning."

Healso studied a comparison group that was rewarded with food at the end of the maze. As the unreinforced ratsexplored the maze, they developed a cognitive map: a mental picture of the layout of the maze (Figure 6.15).After 10 sessions in the maze without reinforcement, food was placed in a goal box at the end of the maze. Assoon as the rats became aware of the food, they were able to find their way through the maze quickly, just asquickly as the comparison group, which had been rewarded with food all along. This is known as latentlearning: learning that occurs but is not observable in behavior until there is a reason to demonstrate it.FIGURE 6.15 Psychologist Edward Tolman found that rats use cognitive maps to navigate through a maze.

Children may learn by watching the actions of their parents but onlydemonstrate it at a later date, when the learned material is needed.

In this way, Ravi learns the route from his house to his school, but he\u2019s neverdriven there himself, so he has not had a chance to demonstrate that he\u2019s learned the way. One morning Ravi\u2019sdad has to leave early for a meeting, so he can\u2019t drive Ravi to school. Instead, Ravi follows the same route on hisbike that his dad would have taken in the car.

In observational learning, we learn by watching others and then imitating, or modeling, what theydo or say. For instance, have you ever gone to YouTube to find a video showing you how to do something? Theindividuals performing the imitated behavior are called models. Research suggests that this imitative learninginvolves a specific type of neuron, called a mirror neuron (Hickock, 2010; Rizzolatti, Fadiga, Fogassi, & Gallese,2002; Rizzolatti, Fogassi, & Gallese, 2006).Humans and other animals are capable of observational learning. For example, in a study of social learning inchimpanzees, researchers gave juice boxes with straws to two groups of captive chimpanzees. The first groupdipped the straw into the juice box, and then sucked on the small amount of juice at the end of the straw. Thesecond group sucked through the straw directly, getting much more juice. When the first group, the \u201cdippers,\u201dobserved the second group, \u201cthe suckers,\u201d what do you think happened? All of the \u201cdippers\u201d in the first groupswitched to sucking through the straws directly. By simply observing the other chimps and modeling theirbehavior, they learned that this was a more efficient method of getting juice (Yamamoto, Humle, and Tanaka,2013).FIGURE 6.16 This spider monkey learned to drink water from a plastic bottle by seeing the behavior modeled by ahuman.

Claire\u2019s nine-year-old son, Jay, was getting into trouble at school and was defiant at home. Clairefeared that Jay would end up like her brothers, two of whom were in prison. One day, after yet another bad dayat school and another negative note from the teacher, Claire, at her wit\u2019s end, beat her son with a belt to get himto behave. Later that night, as she put her children to bed, Claire witnessed her four-year-old daughter, Anna,take a belt to her teddy bear and whip it. Claire was horrified, realizing that Anna was imitating her mother. Itwas then that Claire knew she wanted to discipline her children in a different manner.LINK TO LEARNINGAre chimps smarter than children? Watch this video showing chimps and children performing tasks(http://openstax.org/l/chimpchildren) and contemplate who performed the task better. How about quicker?Like Tolman, whose experiments with rats suggested a cognitive component to learning, psychologist AlbertBandura\u2019s ideas about learning were different from those of strict behaviorists. Bandura and other researchersproposed a brand of behaviorism called social learning theory, which took cognitive processes into account.According to Bandura, pure behaviorism could not explain why learning can take place in the absence ofexternal reinforcement. He felt that internal mental states must also have a role in learning and thatobservational learning involves much more than imitation. In imitation, a person simply copies what themodel does. Observational learning is much more complex. According to Lefran\u00e7ois (2012) there are severalways that observational learning can occur:1. You learn a new response. After watching your coworker get chewed out by your boss for coming in late,you start leaving home 10 minutes earlier so that you won\u2019t be late.2. You choose whether or not to imitate the model depending on what you saw happen to the model.Remember Julian and his father? When learning to surf, Julian might watch how his father pops upsuccessfully on his surfboard and then attempt to do the same thing. On the other hand, Julian might learnnot to touch a hot stove after watching his father get burned on a stove.3. You learn a general rule that you can apply to other situations.Bandura identified three kinds of models: live, verbal, and symbolic. A live model demonstrates a behavior inperson, as when Ben stood up on his surfboard so that Julian could see how he did it. A verbal instructionalmodel does not perform the behavior, but instead explains or describes the behavior, as when a soccer coachtells his young players to kick the ball with the side of the foot, not with the toe. A symbolic model can befictional characters or real people who demonstrate behaviors in books, movies, television shows, videogames, or Internet sources (Figure 6.17).FIGURE 6.17 (a) Yoga students learn by observation as their yoga instructor demonstrates the correct stance andmovement for her students (live model). (b) Models don\u2019t have to be present for learning to occur: through symbolicmodeling, this child can learn a behavior by watching someone demonstrate it on television. (credit a: modification"

This Fordcommercial starring Derek Jeter (http://openstax.org/l/jeter) played for months across the New York, NewJersey, and Connecticut areas. Jeter was an award-winning baseball player for the New York Yankees. Thecommercial aired in a part of the country where Jeter is an incredibly well-known athlete. He is wealthy, andconsidered very loyal and good looking. What message are the advertisers sending by having him featured inthe ad? How effective do you think it is?Steps in the Modeling ProcessOf course, we don\u2019t learn a behavior simply by observing a model. Bandura described specific steps in theprocess of modeling that must be followed if learning is to be successful: attention, retention, reproduction,and motivation. First, you must be focused on what the model is doing\u2014you have to pay attention. Next, youmust be able to retain, or remember, what you observed; this is retention. Then, you must be able to performthe behavior that you observed and committed to memory; this is reproduction. Finally, you must havemotivation. You need to want to copy the behavior, and whether or not you are motivated depends on whathappened to the model. If you saw that the model was reinforced for their behavior, you will be more motivatedto copy them. This is known as vicarious reinforcement. On the other hand, if you observed the model beingpunished, you would be less motivated to copy them. This is called vicarious punishment. For example,imagine that four-year-old Allison watched her older sister Kaitlyn playing in their mother\u2019s makeup, and thensaw Kaitlyn get a time out when their mother came in. After their mother left the room, Allison was tempted toplay in the make-up, but she did not want to get a time-out from her mother. What do you think she did? Onceyou actually demonstrate the new behavior, the reinforcement you receive plays a part in whether or not youwill repeat the behavior.Bandura researched modeling behavior, particularly children\u2019s modeling of adults\u2019 aggressive and violentbehaviors (Bandura, Ross, & Ross, 1961). He conducted an experiment with a five-foot inflatable doll that hecalled a Bobo doll. In the experiment, children\u2019s aggressive behavior was influenced by whether the teacherwas punished for her behavior. In one scenario, a teacher acted aggressively with the doll, hitting, throwing,and even punching the doll, while a child watched. There were two types of responses by the children to theteacher\u2019s behavior. When the teacher was punished for her bad behavior, the children decreased theirtendency to act as she had. When the teacher was praised or ignored (and not punished for her behavior), thechildren imitated what she did, and even what she said. They punched, kicked, and yelled at the doll.LINK TO LEARNINGWatch this video clip about the famous Bobo doll experiment (http://openstax.org/l/bobodoll) to see a portionof the experiment and an interview with Albert Bandura.What are the implications of this study? Bandura concluded that we watch and learn, and that this learning canhave both prosocial and antisocial effects. Prosocial (positive) models can be used to encourage sociallyacceptable behavior. Parents in particular should take note of this finding. If you want your children to read,then read to them. Let them see you reading. Keep books in your home. Talk about your favorite books. If youwant your children to be healthy, then let them see you eat right and exercise, and spend time engaging inphysical fitness activities together. The same holds true for qualities like kindness, courtesy, and honesty. Themain idea is that children observe and learn from their parents, even their parents\u2019 morals, so be consistentand toss out the old adage \u201cDo as I say, not as I do,\u201d because children tend to copy what you do instead of whatyou say. Besides parents, many public figures, such as Martin Luther King, Jr. and Mahatma Gandhi, areviewed as prosocial models who are able to inspire global social change. Can you think of someone who has"

As you saw from the example ofClaire at the beginning of this section, her daughter viewed Claire\u2019s aggressive behavior and copied it.Research suggests that this may help to explain why victims of abuse often grow up to be abusers themselves(Murrell, Christoff, & Henning, 2007). In fact, about 30% of child abuse victims become abusive parents (U.S.Department of Health & Human Services, 2013). We tend to do what we know. Children who grow upwitnessing their parents deal with anger and frustration through violent and aggressive acts often learn tobehave in that manner themselves.Some studies suggest that violent television shows, movies, and video games may also have antisocial effects(Figure 6.18) although further research needs to be done to understand the correlational and causationalaspects of media violence and behavior. Some studies have found a link between viewing violence andaggression seen in children (Anderson & Gentile, 2008; Kirsch, 2010; Miller, Grabell, Thomas, Bermann, &Graham-Bermann, 2012). These findings may not be surprising, given that a child graduating from high schoolhas been exposed to around 200,000 violent acts including murder, robbery, torture, bombings, beatings, andrape through various forms of media (Huston et al., 1992). Not only might viewing media violence affectaggressive behavior by teaching people to act that way in real life situations, but it has also been suggested thatrepeated exposure to violent acts also desensitizes people to it. Psychologists are working to understand thisdynamic.FIGURE 6.18 Can viewing violent media make us violent? Psychological researchers study this topic. (credit:\"woodleywonderworks\"/Flickr)LINK TO LEARNINGView this video about the connection between violent video games and violent behavior (http://openstax.org/l/videogamevio) to learn more.WHAT DO YOU THINK?Violent Media and AggressionDoes watching violent media or playing violent video games cause aggression? Albert Bandura's early studiessuggested television violence increased aggression in children, and more recent studies support these findings.For example, research by Craig Anderson and colleagues (Anderson, Bushman, Donnerstein, Hummer, &Warburton, 2015; Anderson et al., 2010; Bushman et al., 2016) found extensive evidence to suggest a causallink between hours of exposure to violent media and aggressive thoughts and behaviors. However, studies byChristopher Ferguson and others suggests that while there may be a link between violent media exposure andaggression, research to date has not accounted for other risk factors for aggression including mental health andfamily life (Ferguson, 2011; Gentile, 2016).

How is itpossible that the brain is able to move from one thought to the next in an organized, orderly fashion? The brainis endlessly perceiving, processing, planning, organizing, and remembering\u2014it is always active. Yet, you don\u2019tnotice most of your brain\u2019s activity as you move throughout your daily routine. This is only one facet of thecomplex processes involved in cognition. Simply put, cognition is thinking, and it encompasses the processesassociated with perception, knowledge, problem solving, judgment, language, and memory. Scientists whostudy cognition are searching for ways to understand how we integrate, organize, and utilize our consciouscognitive experiences without being aware of all of the unconscious work that our brains are doing (forexample, Kahneman, 2011).CognitionUpon waking each morning, you begin thinking\u2014contemplating the tasks that you must complete that day. Inwhat order should you run your errands? Should you go to the bank, the cleaners, or the grocery store first?Can you get these things done before you head to class or will they need to wait until school is done? Thesethoughts are one example of cognition at work. Exceptionally complex, cognition is an essential feature ofhuman consciousness, yet not all aspects of cognition are consciously experienced.Cognitive psychology is the field of psychology dedicated to examining how people think. It attempts toexplain how and why we think the way we do by studying the interactions among human thinking, emotion,creativity, language, and problem solving, in addition to other cognitive processes. Cognitive psychologistsstrive to determine and measure different types of intelligence, why some people are better at problem solvingthan others, and how emotional intelligence affects success in the workplace, among countless other topics.They also sometimes focus on how we organize thoughts and information gathered from our environmentsinto meaningful categories of thought, which will be discussed later.Concepts and PrototypesThe human nervous system is capable of handling endless streams of information. The senses serve as theinterface between the mind and the external environment, receiving stimuli and translating it into nervousimpulses that are transmitted to the brain. The brain then processes this information and uses the relevantpieces to create thoughts, which can then be expressed through language or stored in memory for future use.To make this process more complex, the brain does not gather information from external environments only.When thoughts are formed, the mind synthesizes information from emotions and memories (Figure 7.2).Emotion and memory are powerful influences on both our thoughts and behaviors."

        "data": "Page 2157.1 \u2022 What Is Cognition? 215FIGURE 7.2 Sensations and information are received by our brains, filtered through emotions and memories, andprocessed to become thoughts.In order to organize this staggering amount of information, the mind has developed a \"file cabinet\" of sorts inthe mind. The different files stored in the file cabinet are called concepts. Concepts are categories or groupingsof linguistic information, images, ideas, or memories, such as life experiences. Concepts are, in many ways, bigideas that are generated by observing details, and categorizing and combining these details into cognitivestructures. You use concepts to see the relationships among the different elements of your experiences and tokeep the information in your mind organized and accessible.Concepts are informed by our semantic memory (you will learn more about semantic memory in a laterchapter) and are present in every aspect of our lives; however, one of the easiest places to notice concepts isinside a classroom, where they are discussed explicitly. When you study United States history, for example, youlearn about more than just individual events that have happened in America\u2019s past. You absorb a large quantityof information by listening to and participating in discussions, examining maps, and reading first-handaccounts of people\u2019s lives. Your brain analyzes these details and develops an overall understanding ofAmerican history. In the process, your brain gathers details that inform and refine your understanding ofrelated concepts like democracy, power, and freedom.Concepts can be complex and abstract, like justice, or more concrete, like types of birds. In psychology, forexample, Piaget\u2019s stages of development are abstract concepts. Some concepts, like tolerance, are agreed uponby many people, because they have been used in various ways over many years. Other concepts, like thecharacteristics of your ideal friend or your family\u2019s birthday traditions, are personal and individualized. In thisway, concepts touch every aspect of our lives, from our many daily routines to the guiding principles behindthe way governments function.Another technique used by your brain to organize information is the identification of prototypes for theconcepts you have developed. A prototype is the best example or representation of a concept. For example,what comes to your mind when you think of a dog? Most likely your early experiences with dogs will shapewhat you imagine. If your first pet was a Golden Retriever, there is a good chance that this would be yourprototype for the category of dogs.Natural and Artificial ConceptsIn psychology, concepts can be divided into two categories, natural and artificial. Natural concepts are created\u201cnaturally\u201d through your experiences and can be developed from either direct or indirect experiences. Forexample, if you live in Essex Junction, Vermont, you have probably had a lot of direct experience with snow.You\u2019ve watched it fall from the sky, you\u2019ve seen lightly falling snow that barely covers the windshield of yourcar, and you\u2019ve shoveled out 18 inches of fluffy white snow as you\u2019ve thought, \u201cThis is perfect for skiing.\u201d"

Either way, snow is a natural conceptbecause you can construct an understanding of it through direct observations, experiences with snow, orindirect knowledge (such as from films or books) (Figure 7.3).FIGURE 7.3 (a) Our concept of snow is an example of a natural concept\u2014one that we understand through directobservation and experience. (b) In contrast, artificial concepts are ones that we know by a specific set ofcharacteristics that they always exhibit, such as what defines different basic shapes. (credit a: modification of workby Maarten Takens; credit b: modification of work by \u201cShayan (USA)\u201d/Flickr)An artificial concept, on the other hand, is a concept that is defined by a specific set of characteristics. Variousproperties of geometric shapes, like squares and triangles, serve as useful examples of artificial concepts. Atriangle always has three angles and three sides. A square always has four equal sides and four right angles.Mathematical formulas, like the equation for area (length \u00d7 width) are artificial concepts defined by specificsets of characteristics that are always the same. Artificial concepts can enhance the understanding of a topicby building on one another. For example, before learning the concept of \u201carea of a square\u201d (and the formula tofind it), you must understand what a square is. Once the concept of \u201carea of a square\u201d is understood, anunderstanding of area for other geometric shapes can be built upon the original understanding of area. Theuse of artificial concepts to define an idea is crucial to communicating with others and engaging in complexthought. According to Goldstone and Kersten (2003), concepts act as building blocks and can be connected incountless combinations to create complex thoughts.SchemataA schema is a mental construct consisting of a cluster or collection of related concepts (Bartlett, 1932). Thereare many different types of schemata, and they all have one thing in common: schemata are a method oforganizing information that allows the brain to work more efficiently. When a schema is activated, the brainmakes immediate assumptions about the person or object being observed.There are several types of schemata. A role schema makes assumptions about how individuals in certain roleswill behave (Callero, 1994). For example, imagine you meet someone who introduces himself as a firefighter.When this happens, your brain automatically activates the \u201cfirefighter schema\u201d and begins makingassumptions that this person is brave, selfless, and community-oriented. Despite not knowing this person,already you have unknowingly made judgments about them. Schemata also help you fill in gaps in theinformation you receive from the world around you. While schemata allow for more efficient informationprocessing, there can be problems with schemata, regardless of whether they are accurate: Perhaps thisparticular firefighter is not brave, they just work as a firefighter to pay the bills while studying to become achildren\u2019s librarian."

Thinkabout what you do when you walk into an elevator (Figure 7.4). First, the doors open and you wait to let exitingpassengers leave the elevator car. Then, you step into the elevator and turn around to face the doors, lookingfor the correct button to push. You never face the back of the elevator, do you? And when you\u2019re riding in acrowded elevator and you can\u2019t face the front, it feels uncomfortable, doesn\u2019t it? Interestingly, event schematacan vary widely among different cultures and countries. For example, while it is quite common for people togreet one another with a handshake in the United States, in Tibet, you greet someone by sticking your tongueout at them, and in Belize, you bump fists (Cairns Regional Council, n.d.)FIGURE 7.4 What event schema do you perform when riding in an elevator? (credit: \u201cGideon\u201d/Flickr)Because event schemata are automatic, they can be difficult to change. Imagine that you are driving home fromwork or school. This event schema involves getting in the car, shutting the door, and buckling your seatbeltbefore putting the key in the ignition. You might perform this script two or three times each day. As you drivehome, you hear your phone\u2019s ring tone. Typically, the event schema that occurs when you hear your phoneringing involves locating the phone and answering it or responding to your latest text message. So withoutthinking, you reach for your phone, which could be in your pocket, in your bag, or on the passenger seat of thecar. This powerful event schema is informed by your pattern of behavior and the pleasurable stimulation that aphone call or text message gives your brain. Because it is a schema, it is extremely challenging for us to stopreaching for the phone, even though we know that we endanger our own lives and the lives of others while wedo it (Neyfakh, 2013) (Figure 7.5).FIGURE 7.5 Texting while driving is dangerous, but it is a difficult event schema for some people to resist.Remember the elevator? It feels almost impossible to walk in and notface the door. Our powerful event schemadictates our behavior in the elevator, and it is no different with our phones. Current research suggests that it isthe habit, or event schema, of checking our phones in many different situations that makes refraining fromchecking them while driving especially difficult (Bayer & Campbell, 2012). Because texting and driving hasbecome a dangerous epidemic in recent years, psychologists are looking at ways to help people interrupt the\u201cphone schema\u201d while driving. Event schemata like these are the reason why many habits are difficult to breakonce they have been acquired. As we continue to examine thinking, keep in mind how powerful the forces ofconcepts and schemata are to our understanding of the world."

While language is a form of communication, not allcommunication is language. Many species communicate with one another through their postures, movements,odors, or vocalizations. This communication is crucial for species that need to interact and develop socialrelationships with their conspecifics. However, many people have asserted that it is language that makeshumans unique among all of the animal species (Corballis & Suddendorf, 2007; Tomasello & Rakoczy, 2003).This section will focus on what distinguishes language as a special form of communication, how the use oflanguage develops, and how language affects the way we think.Components of LanguageLanguage, be it spoken, signed, or written, has specific components: a lexicon and grammar. Lexicon refers tothe words of a given language. Thus, lexicon is a language\u2019s vocabulary. Grammar refers to the set of rules thatare used to convey meaning through the use of the lexicon (Fern\u00e1ndez & Cairns, 2011). For instance, Englishgrammar dictates that most verbs receive an \u201c-ed\u201d at the end to indicate past tense.Words are formed by combining the various phonemes that make up the language. A phoneme (e.g., thesounds \u201cah\u201d vs. \u201ceh\u201d) is a basic sound unit of a given language, and different languages have different sets ofphonemes. Phonemes are combined to form morphemes, which are the smallest units of language that conveysome type of meaning (e.g., \u201cI\u201d is both a phoneme and a morpheme). We use semantics and syntax to constructlanguage. Semantics and syntax are part of a language\u2019s grammar. Semantics refers to the process by whichwe derive meaning from morphemes and words. Syntax refers to the way words are organized into sentences(Chomsky, 1965; Fern\u00e1ndez & Cairns, 2011).We apply the rules of grammar to organize the lexicon in novel and creative ways, which allow us tocommunicate information about both concrete and abstract concepts. We can talk about our immediate andobservable surroundings as well as the surface of unseen planets. We can share our innermost thoughts, ourplans for the future, and debate the value of a college education. We can provide detailed instructions forcooking a meal, fixing a car, or building a fire. Through our use of words and language, we are able to form,organize, and express ideas, schema, and artificial concepts.Language DevelopmentGiven the remarkable complexity of a language, one might expect that mastering a language would be anespecially arduous task; indeed, for those of us trying to learn a second language as adults, this might seem tobe true. However, young children master language very quickly with relative ease. B. F. Skinner (1957)proposed that language is learned through reinforcement. Noam Chomsky (1965) criticized this behavioristapproach, asserting instead that the mechanisms underlying language acquisition are biologicallydetermined. The use of language develops in the absence of formal instruction and appears to follow a verysimilar pattern in children from vastly different cultures and backgrounds. It would seem, therefore, that weare born with a biological predisposition to acquire a language (Chomsky, 1965; Fern\u00e1ndez & Cairns, 2011).Moreover, it appears that there is a critical period for language acquisition, such that this proficiency atacquiring language is maximal early in life; generally, as people age, the ease with which they acquire andmaster new languages diminishes (Johnson & Newport, 1989; Lenneberg, 1967; Singleton, 1995).Children begin to learn about language from a very early age (Table 7.1). In fact, it appears that this is"

Newborns show preference for their mother\u2019s voice and appear to be ableto discriminate between the language spoken by their mother and other languages. Babies are also attuned tothe languages being used around them and show preferences for videos of faces that are moving in synchronywith the audio of spoken language versus videos that do not synchronize with the audio (Blossom & Morgan,2006; Pickens, 1994; Spelke & Cortelyou, 1981).7.2 \u2022 Language 219Stages of Language and Communication DevelopmentStageAgeDevelopmental Language and Communication12345670\u20133 monthsReflexive communication3\u20138 monthsReflexive communication; interest in others8\u201313 monthsIntentional communication; sociability12\u201318 months First words18\u201324 months Simple sentences of two words2\u20133 yearsSentences of three or more words3\u20135 yearsComplex sentences; has conversationsTABLE 7.1DIG DEEPERThe Case of GenieIn the fall of 1970, a social worker in the Los Angeles area found a 13-year-old girl who was being raised inextremely neglectful and abusive conditions. The girl, who came to be known as Genie, had lived most of her lifetied to a potty chair or confined to a crib in a small room that was kept closed with the curtains drawn. For a littleover a decade, Genie had virtually no social interaction and no access to the outside world. As a result of theseconditions, Genie was unable to stand up, chew solid food, or speak (Fromkin, Krashen, Curtiss, Rigler, & Rigler,1974; Rymer, 1993). The police took Genie into protective custody.Genie\u2019s abilities improved dramatically following her removal from her abusive environment, and early on, itappeared she was acquiring language\u2014much later than would be predicted by critical period hypotheses thathad been posited at the time (Fromkin et al., 1974). Genie managed to amass an impressive vocabulary in arelatively short amount of time. However, she never developed a mastery of the grammatical aspects of language(Curtiss, 1981). Perhaps being deprived of the opportunity to learn language during a critical period impededGenie\u2019s ability to fully acquire and use language.You may recall that each language has its own set of phonemes that are used to generate morphemes, words,and so on. Babies can discriminate among the sounds that make up a language (for example, they can tell thedifference between the \u201cs\u201d in vision and the \u201css\u201d in fission); early on, they can differentiate between the soundsof all human languages, even those that do not occur in the languages that are used in their environments.However, by the time that they are about 1 year old, they can only discriminate among those phonemes that areused in the language or languages in their environments (Jensen, 2011; Werker & Lalonde, 1988; Werker &Tees, 1984)."

As time passes, more variations appear in thesyllables that they produce. During this time, it is unlikely that the babies are trying to communicate; they arejust as likely to babble when they are alone as when they are with their caregivers (Fern\u00e1ndez & Cairns, 2011).Interestingly, babies who are raised in environments in which sign language is used will also begin to showbabbling in the gestures of their hands during this stage (Petitto, Holowka, Sergio, Levy, & Ostry, 2004).Generally, a child\u2019s first word is uttered sometime between the ages of 1 year to 18 months, and for the next fewmonths, the child will remain in the \u201cone word\u201d stage of language development. During this time, childrenknow a number of words, but they only produce one-word utterances. The child\u2019s early vocabulary is limited tofamiliar objects or events, often nouns. Although children in this stage only make one-word utterances, thesewords often carry larger meaning (Fern\u00e1ndez & Cairns, 2011). So, for example, a child saying \u201ccookie\u201d could beidentifying a cookie or asking for a cookie.As a child\u2019s lexicon grows, they begin to utter simple sentences and to acquire new vocabulary at a very rapidpace. In addition, children begin to demonstrate a clear understanding of the specific rules that apply to theirlanguage(s). Even the mistakes that children sometimes make provide evidence of just how much theyunderstand about those rules. This is sometimes seen in the form of overgeneralization. In this context,overgeneralization refers to an extension of a language rule to an exception to the rule. For example, inEnglish, it is usually the case that an \u201cs\u201d is added to the end of a word to indicate plurality. For example, wespeak of one dog versus two dogs. Young children will overgeneralize this rule to cases that are exceptions tothe \u201cadd an s to the end of the word\u201d rule and say things like \u201cthose two gooses\u201d or \u201cthree mouses.\u201d Clearly, therules of the language are understood, even if the exceptions to the rules are still being learned (Moskowitz,1978).Language and ThoughtWhen we speak one language, we agree that words are representations of ideas, people, places, and events. Thegiven language that children learn is connected to their culture and surroundings. But can words themselvesshape the way we think about things? Psychologists have long investigated the question of whether languageshapes thoughts and actions, or whether our thoughts and beliefs shape our language. Two researchers,Edward Sapir and Benjamin Lee Whorf, began this investigation in the 1940s. They wanted to understand howthe language habits of a community encourage members of that community to interpret language in aparticular manner (Sapir, 1941/1964). Sapir and Whorf proposed that language determines thought. Forexample, in some languages there are many different words for love. However, in English we use the word lovefor all types of love. Does this affect how we think about love depending on the language that we speak (Whorf,1956)? Researchers have since identified this view as too absolute, pointing out a lack of empiricism behindwhat Sapir and Whorf proposed (Abler, 2013; Boroditsky, 2011; van Troyer, 1994). Today, psychologistscontinue to study and debate the relationship between language and thought.The Meaning of LanguageThink about what you know of other languages; perhaps you even speak multiple languages. Imagine for amoment that your closest friend fluently speaks more than one language. Do you think that friend thinksdifferently, depending on which language is being spoken? You may know a few words that are not translatableWHAT DO YOU THINK?"

For example, the Portuguese word saudadeoriginated during the 15thcentury, when Portuguese sailors left home to explore the seas and travel to Africa or Asia. Those left behinddescribed the emptiness and fondness they felt as saudade(Figure 7.6).The word came to express manymeanings, including loss, nostalgia, yearning, warm memories, and hope. There is no single word in English thatincludes all of those emotions in a single description. Do words such as saudadeindicate that different languagesproduce different patterns of thought in people? What do you think??FIGURE 7.6 These two works of art depict saudade. (a) Saudade de N\u00e1poles, which is translated into \u201cmissingNaples,\u201d was painted by Bertha Worms in 1895. (b) Almeida J\u00fanior painted Saudadein 1899.Language may indeed influence the way that we think, an idea known as linguistic determinism. One recentdemonstration of this phenomenon involved differences in the way that English and Mandarin Chinesespeakers talk and think about time. English speakers tend to talk about time using terms that describechanges along a horizontal dimension, for example, saying something like \u201cI\u2019m running behind schedule\u201d or\u201cDon\u2019t get ahead of yourself.\u201d While Mandarin Chinese speakers also describe time in horizontal terms, it is notuncommon to also use terms associated with a vertical arrangement. For example, the past might be describedas being \u201cup\u201d and the future as being \u201cdown.\u201d It turns out that these differences in language translate intodifferences in performance on cognitive tests designed to measure how quickly an individual can recognizetemporal relationships. Specifically, when given a series of tasks with vertical priming, Mandarin Chinesespeakers were faster at recognizing temporal relationships between months. Indeed, Boroditsky (2001) seesthese results as suggesting that \u201chabits in language encourage habits in thought\u201d (p. 12).One group of researchers who wanted to investigate how language influences thought compared how Englishspeakers and the Dani people of Papua New Guinea think and speak about color. The Dani have two words forcolor: one word for lightand one word for dark. In contrast, the English language has 11 color words.Researchers hypothesized that the number of color terms could limit the ways that the Dani peopleconceptualized color. However, the Dani were able to distinguish colors with the same ability as Englishspeakers, despite having fewer words at their disposal (Berlin & Kay, 1969). A recent review of research aimedat determining how language might affect something like color perception suggests that language caninfluence perceptual phenomena, especially in the left hemisphere of the brain.

Sometimes these problemsare straightforward: To double a recipe for pizza dough, for example, all that is required is that each ingredientin the recipe be doubled. Sometimes, however, the problems we encounter are more complex. For example,say you have a work deadline, and you must mail a printed copy of a report to your supervisor by the end of thebusiness day. The report is time-sensitive and must be sent overnight. You finished the report last night, butyour printer will not work today. What should you do? First, you need to identify the problem and then apply astrategy for solving the problem.Problem-Solving StrategiesWhen you are presented with a problem\u2014whether it is a complex mathematical problem or a broken printer,how do you solve it? Before finding a solution to the problem, the problem must first be clearly identified. Afterthat, one of many problem solving strategies can be applied, hopefully resulting in a solution.A problem-solving strategy is a plan of action used to find a solution. Different strategies have different actionplans associated with them (Table 7.2). For example, a well-known strategy is trial and error. The old adage,\u201cIf at first you don\u2019t succeed, try, try again\u201d describes trial and error. In terms of your broken printer, you couldtry checking the ink levels, and if that doesn\u2019t work, you could check to make sure the paper tray isn\u2019t jammed.Or maybe the printer isn\u2019t actually connected to your laptop. When using trial and error, you would continue totry different solutions until you solved your problem. Although trial and error is not typically one of the mosttime-efficient strategies, it is a commonly used one.Problem-Solving StrategiesMethodDescriptionExampleTrial anderrorContinue trying differentsolutions until problem is solvedRestarting phone, turning off WiFi, turning off bluetooth in orderto determine why your phone is malfunctioningAlgorithmStep-by-step problem-solvingformulaHeuristicGeneral problem-solvingframeworkTABLE 7.2Instructional video for installing new software on your computerWorking backwards; breaking a task into stepsAnother type of strategy is an algorithm. An algorithm is a problem-solving formula that provides you withstep-by-step instructions used to achieve a desired outcome (Kahneman, 2011). You can think of an algorithmas a recipe with highly detailed instructions that produce the same result every time they are performed.Algorithms are used frequently in our everyday lives, especially in computer science. When you run a searchon the Internet, search engines like Google use algorithms to decide which entries will appear first in your listof results. Facebook also uses algorithms to decide which posts to display on your newsfeed. Can you identifyother situations in which algorithms are used?"

While an algorithm must be followed exactly to producea correct result, a heuristic is a general problem-solving framework (Tversky & Kahneman, 1974). You canthink of these as mental shortcuts that are used to solve problems. A \u201crule of thumb\u201d is an example of aheuristic. Such a rule saves the person time and energy when making a decision, but despite its time-savingcharacteristics, it is not always the best method for making a rational decision. Different types of heuristics areused in different types of situations, but the impulse to use a heuristic occurs when one of five conditions ismet (Pratkanis, 1989):\u2022 When one is faced with too much information\u2022 When the time to make a decision is limited\u2022 When the decision to be made is unimportant\u2022 When there is access to very little information to use in making the decision\u2022 When an appropriate heuristic happens to come to mind in the same momentWorking backwards is a useful heuristic in which you begin solving the problem by focusing on the endresult. Consider this example: You live in Washington, D.C. and have been invited to a wedding at 4 PM onSaturday in Philadelphia. Knowing that Interstate 95 tends to back up any day of the week, you need to planyour route and time your departure accordingly. If you want to be at the wedding service by 3:30 PM, and ittakes 2.5 hours to get to Philadelphia without traffic, what time should you leave your house? You use theworking backwards heuristic to plan the events of your day on a regular basis, probably without even thinkingabout it.Another useful heuristic is the practice of accomplishing a large goal or task by breaking it into a series ofsmaller steps. Students often use this common method to complete a large research project or long essay forschool. For example, students typically brainstorm, develop a thesis or main topic, research the chosen topic,organize their information into an outline, write a rough draft, revise and edit the rough draft, develop a finaldraft, organize the references list, and proofread their work before turning in the project. The large taskbecomes less overwhelming when it is broken down into a series of small steps.EVERYDAY CONNECTIONSolving PuzzlesProblem-solving abilities can improve with practice. Many people challenge themselves every day with puzzlesand other mental exercises to sharpen their problem-solving skills. Sudoku puzzles appear daily in mostnewspapers. Typically, a sudoku puzzle is a 9\u00d79 grid. The simple sudoku below (Figure 7.7) is a 4\u00d74 grid. To solvethe puzzle, fill in the empty boxes with a single digit: 1, 2, 3, or 4.

Imagine a person in a room that has four doorways. One doorway that has always been open in thepast is now locked. The person, accustomed to exiting the room by that particular doorway, keeps trying to getout through the same doorway even though the other three doorways are open. The person is stuck\u2014but theyjust need to go to another doorway, instead of trying to get out through the locked doorway. A mental set iswhere you persist in approaching a problem in a way that has worked in the past but is clearly not workingnow.Functional fixedness is a type of mental set where you cannot perceive an object being used for somethingother than what it was designed for. Duncker (1945) conducted foundational research on functional fixedness.He created an experiment in which participants were given a candle, a book of matches, and a box ofthumbtacks. They were instructed to use those items to attach the candle to the wall so that it did not drip waxonto the table below. Participants had to use functional fixedness to overcome the problem (Figure 7.10).During the Apollo 13mission to the moon, NASA engineers at Mission Control had to overcome functionalfixedness to save the lives of the astronauts aboard the spacecraft. An explosion in a module of the spacecraftdamaged multiple systems. The astronauts were in danger of being poisoned by rising levels of carbon dioxidebecause of problems with the carbon dioxide filters. The engineers found a way for the astronauts to use spareplastic bags, tape, and air hoses to create a makeshift air filter, which saved the lives of the astronauts."

In one experiment,individuals from the Shuar group in Ecuador were asked to use an object for a purpose other than that forwhich the object was originally intended. For example, the participants were told a story about a bear and arabbit that were separated by a river and asked to select among various objects, including a spoon, a cup,erasers, and so on, to help the animals. The spoon was the only object long enough to span the imaginary river,but if the spoon was presented in a way that reflected its normal usage, it took participants longer to choosethe spoon to solve the problem. (German & Barrett, 2005). The researchers wanted to know if exposure tohighly specialized tools, as occurs with individuals in industrialized nations, affects their ability to transcendfunctional fixedness. It was determined that functional fixedness is experienced in both industrialized andnonindustrialized cultures (German & Barrett, 2005).In order to make good decisions, we use our knowledge and our reasoning. Often, this knowledge andreasoning is sound and solid. Sometimes, however, we are swayed by biases or by others manipulating asituation. For example, let\u2019s say you and three friends wanted to rent a house and had a combined targetbudget of $1,600. The realtor shows you only very run-down houses for $1,600 and then shows you a very nicehouse for $2,000. Might you ask each person to pay more in rent to get the $2,000 home? Why would therealtor show you the run-down houses and the nice house? The realtor may be challenging your anchoringbias. An anchoring bias occurs when you focus on one piece of information when making a decision or solvinga problem. In this case, you\u2019re so focused on the amount of money you are willing to spend that you may notrecognize what kinds of houses are available at that price point.The confirmation bias is the tendency to focus on information that confirms your existing beliefs. Forexample, if you think that your professor is not very nice, you notice all of the instances of rude behaviorexhibited by the professor while ignoring the countless pleasant interactions he is involved in on a daily basis.Hindsight bias leads you to believe that the event you just experienced was predictable, even though it reallywasn\u2019t. In other words, you knew all along that things would turn out the way they did. Representative biasdescribes a faulty way of thinking, in which you unintentionally stereotype someone or something; forexample, you may assume that your professors spend their free time reading books and engaging inintellectual conversation, because the idea of them spending their time playing volleyball or visiting anamusement park does not fit in with your stereotypes of professors.Finally, the availability heuristic is a heuristic in which you make a decision based on an example,"

Go!\u201d The father stops and looks at his son. \u201cCan you readthat?\u201d he asks. \u201cYes, Daddy!\u201d And he points to the words and reads again, \u201cGo, Pig! Go!\u201dThis father was not actively teaching his son to read, even though the child constantly asked questions aboutletters, words, and symbols that they saw everywhere: in the car, in the store, on the television. The dadwondered about what else his son might understand and decided to try an experiment. Grabbing a sheet ofblank paper, he wrote several simple words in a list: mom, dad, dog, bird, bed, truck, car, tree. He put the listdown in front of the boy and asked him to read the words. \u201cDad, dog, bird, bed, truck, car, tree,\u201d he read,slowing down to carefully pronounce birdand truck.Then, \u201cDid I do it, Daddy?\u201d \u201cYou sure did! That is verygood.\u201d The father gave his little boy a warm hug and continued reading the story about the pig, all the whilewondering if his son\u2019s abilities were an indication of exceptional intelligence or simply a normal pattern oflinguistic development. Like the father in this example, psychologists have wondered what constitutesintelligence and how it can be measured.Classifying IntelligenceWhat exactly is intelligence? The way that researchers have defined the concept of intelligence has beenmodified many times since the birth of psychology. British psychologist Charles Spearman believedintelligence consisted of one general factor, called g, which could be measured and compared amongindividuals. Spearman focused on the commonalities among various intellectual abilities and de-emphasizedwhat made each unique. Long before modern psychology developed, however, ancient philosophers, such asAristotle, held a similar view (Cianciolo & Sternberg, 2004).Others psychologists believe that instead of a single factor, intelligence is a collection of distinct abilities. In the1940s, Raymond Cattell proposed a theory of intelligence that divided general intelligence into twocomponents: crystallized intelligence and fluid intelligence (Cattell, 1963). Crystallized intelligence ischaracterized as acquired knowledge and the ability to retrieve it. When you learn, remember, and recallinformation, you are using crystallized intelligence. You use crystallized intelligence all the time in yourcoursework by demonstrating that you have mastered the information covered in the course. Fluidintelligence encompasses the ability to see complex relationships and solve problems. Navigating your wayhome after being detoured onto an unfamiliar route because of road construction would draw upon your fluidintelligence. Fluid intelligence helps you tackle complex, abstract challenges in your daily life, whereascrystallized intelligence helps you overcome concrete, straightforward problems (Cattell, 1963).Other theorists and psychologists believe that intelligence should be defined in more practical terms. Forexample, what types of behaviors help you get ahead in life? Which skills promote success? Think about thisfor a moment. Being able to recite all 45 presidents of the United States in order is an excellent party trick, butwill knowing this make you a better person?Robert Sternberg developed another theory of intelligence, which he titled the triarchic theory of intelligencebecause it sees intelligence as comprised of three parts (Sternberg, 1988): practical, creative, and analyticalintelligence (Figure 7.12)."

Sternberg saysthat analytical intelligence is demonstrated by an ability to analyze, evaluate, judge, compare, and contrast.When reading a classic novel for literature class, for example, it is usually necessary to compare the motives ofthe main characters of the book or analyze the historical context of the story. In a science course such asanatomy, you must study the processes by which the body uses various minerals in different human systems.In developing an understanding of this topic, you are using analytical intelligence. When solving a challengingmath problem, you would apply analytical intelligence to analyze different aspects of the problem and thensolve it section by section.Creative intelligence is marked by inventing or imagining a solution to a problem or situation. Creativity inthis realm can include finding a novel solution to an unexpected problem or producing a beautiful work of artor a well-developed short story. Imagine for a moment that you are camping in the woods with some friendsand realize that you\u2019ve forgotten your camp coffee pot. The person in your group who figures out a way tosuccessfully brew coffee for everyone would be credited as having higher creative intelligence.Multiple Intelligences Theory was developed by Howard Gardner, a Harvard psychologist and former studentof Erik Erikson. In Gardner\u2019s theory, each person possesses at least eight intelligences. The eight intelligencesare linguistic intelligence, logical-mathematical intelligence, musical intelligence, bodily kinestheticintelligence, spatial intelligence, interpersonal intelligence, intrapersonal intelligence, and naturalisticintelligence. Among cognitive psychologists, Gardner\u2019s theory has been heavily criticized for lacking empiricalevidence. However, educators continue to study and use Gardner\u2019s theory, with some colleges even discussinghow they integrate Gardner\u2019s theory into their classrooms. Gottfredson describes one possible reason for thecontinued use of Gardner\u2019s theory: \u201c . . . that there are multiple independent intelligences, suggesting thateveryone can be smart in some way. This is, understandably, a very attractive idea in democratic societies\u201d(2004).Gardner\u2019s inter- and intrapersonal intelligences are often combined into a single type: emotional intelligence.Emotional intelligence encompasses the ability to understand the emotions of yourself and others, showempathy, understand social relationships and cues, and regulate your own emotions and respond in culturallyappropriate ways (Parker, Saklofske, & Stough, 2009). People with high emotional intelligence typically havewell-developed social skills. Some researchers, including Daniel Goleman, the author of EmotionalIntelligence: Why It Can Matter More than IQ, argue that emotional intelligence is a better predictor of successthan traditional intelligence (Goleman, 1995). However, emotional intelligence has been widely debated, with"

In this theory, abilities are related and arranged in a hierarchy withgeneral abilities at the top, broad abilities in the middle, and narrow (specific) abilities at the bottom. Thenarrow abilities are the only ones that can be directly measured; however, they are integrated within the otherabilities. At the general level is general intelligence. Next, the broad level consists of general abilities such asfluid reasoning, short-term memory, and processing speed. Finally, as the hierarchy continues, the narrowlevel includes specific forms of cognitive abilities. For example, short-term memory would further break downinto memory span and working memory capacity.Intelligence can also have different meanings and values in different cultures. If you live on a small island,where most people get their food by fishing from boats, it would be important to know how to fish and how torepair a boat. If you were an exceptional angler, your peers would probably consider you intelligent. If you werealso skilled at repairing boats, your intelligence might be known across the whole island. Think about yourown family\u2019s culture. What values are important for Latinx families? Italian families? In Irish families,hospitality and telling an entertaining story are marks of the culture. If you are a skilled storyteller, othermembers of Irish culture are likely to consider you intelligent.Some cultures place a high value on working together as a collective. In these cultures, the importance of thegroup supersedes the importance of individual achievement. When you visit such a culture, how well yourelate to the values of that culture exemplifies your cultural intelligence, sometimes referred to as culturalcompetence.LINK TO LEARNINGWatch this video that compares different theories of intelligence (http://openstax.org/l/theoryintel) to learnmore.CreativityCreativity is the ability to generate, create, or discover new ideas, solutions, and possibilities. Very creativepeople often have intense knowledge about something, work on it for years, look at novel solutions, seek outthe advice and help of other experts, and take risks. Although creativity is often associated with the arts, it isactually a vital form of intelligence that drives people in many disciplines to discover something new.Creativity can be found in every area of life, from the way you decorate your residence to a new way ofunderstanding how a cell works.Creativity is often connected to a person\u2019s ability to engage in divergent thinking. Divergent thinking can bedescribed as thinking \u201coutside the box;\u201d it allows an individual to arrive at unique, multiple solutions to a givenproblem.

IQ stands for intelligence quotient and describes a score earned on a test designed to measureintelligence. You\u2019ve already learned that there are many ways psychologists describe intelligence (or moreaptly, intelligences). Similarly, IQ tests\u2014the tools designed to measure intelligence\u2014have been the subject ofdebate throughout their development and use.When might an IQ test be used? What do we learn from the results, and how might people use thisinformation? While there are certainly many benefits to intelligence testing, it is important to also note thelimitations and controversies surrounding these tests. For example, IQ tests have sometimes been used asarguments in support of insidious purposes, such as the eugenics movement (Severson, 2011). The infamousSupreme Court Case, Buck v. Bell, legalized the forced sterilization of some people deemed \u201cfeeble-minded\u201dthrough this type of testing, resulting in about 65,000 sterilizations (Buck v. Bell, 274 U.S. 200; Ko, 2016).Today, only professionals trained in psychology can administer IQ tests, and the purchase of most testsrequires an advanced degree in psychology. Other professionals in the field, such as social workers andpsychiatrists, cannot administer IQ tests. In this section, we will explore what intelligence tests measure, howthey are scored, and how they were developed.Measuring IntelligenceIt seems that the human understanding of intelligence is somewhat limited when we focus on traditional oracademic-type intelligence. How then, can intelligence be measured? And when we measure intelligence, howdo we ensure that we capture what we\u2019re really trying to measure (in other words, that IQ tests function as validmeasures of intelligence)? In the following paragraphs, we will explore how intelligence tests were developedand the history of their use.The IQ test has been synonymous with intelligence for over a century. In the late 1800s, Sir Francis Galtondeveloped the first broad test of intelligence (Flanagan & Kaufman, 2004). Although he was not a psychologist,his contributions to the concepts of intelligence testing are still felt today (Gordon, 1995). Reliable intelligencetesting (you may recall from earlier chapters that reliability refers to a test\u2019s ability to produce consistentresults) began in earnest during the early 1900s with a researcher named Alfred Binet (Figure 7.13). Binet wasasked by the French government to develop an intelligence test to use on children to determine which onesmight have difficulty in school; it included many verbally based tasks. American researchers soon realized thevalue of such testing. Louis Terman, a Stanford professor, modified Binet\u2019s work by standardizing theadministration of the test and tested thousands of different-aged children to establish an average score foreach age. As a result, the test was normed and standardized, which means that the test was administeredconsistently to a large enough representative sample of the population that the range of scores resulted in abell curve (bell curves will be discussed later). Standardization means that the manner of administration,"

Norming involves giving a test to a large population so datacan be collected comparing groups, such as age groups. The resulting data provide norms, or referentialscores, by which to interpret future scores. Norms are not expectations of what a given group shouldknow buta demonstration of what that group doesknow. Norming and standardizing the test ensures that new scoresare reliable. This new version of the test was called the Stanford-Binet Intelligence Scale (Terman, 1916).Remarkably, an updated version of this test is still widely used today.FIGURE 7.13 French psychologist Alfred Binet helped to develop intelligence testing. (b) This page is from a 1908version of the Binet-Simon Intelligence Scale. Children being tested were asked which face, of each pair, wasprettier.In 1939, David Wechsler, a psychologist who spent part of his career working with World War I veterans,developed a new IQ test in the United States. Wechsler combined several subtests from other intelligence testsused between 1880 and World War I. These subtests tapped into a variety of verbal and nonverbal skills,because Wechsler believed that intelligence encompassed \u201cthe global capacity of a person to act purposefully,to think rationally, and to deal effectively with his environment\u201d (Wechsler, 1958, p. 7). He named the test theWechsler-Bellevue Intelligence Scale (Wechsler, 1981). This combination of subtests became one of the mostextensively used intelligence tests in the history of psychology. Although its name was later changed to theWechsler Adult Intelligence Scale (WAIS) and has been revised several times, the aims of the test remainvirtually unchanged since its inception (Boake, 2002). Today, there are three intelligence tests credited toWechsler, the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale-fourth edition (WAIS-IV), the Wechsler Intelligence Scale forChildren (WISC-V), and the Wechsler Preschool and Primary Scale of Intelligence\u2014IV (WPPSI-IV) (Wechsler,2012). These tests are used widely in schools and communities throughout the United States, and they areperiodically normed and standardized as a means of recalibration. As a part of the recalibration process, theWISC-V was given to thousands of children across the country, and children taking the test today are comparedwith their same-age peers (Figure 7.13).The WISC-V is composed of 14 subtests, which comprise five indices, which then render an IQ score. The fiveindices are Verbal Comprehension, Visual Spatial, Fluid Reasoning, Working Memory, and Processing Speed.When the test is complete, individuals receive a score for each of the five indices and a Full Scale IQ score. Themethod of scoring reflects the understanding that intelligence is comprised of multiple abilities in severalcognitive realms and focuses on the mental processes that the child used to arrive at their answers to each testitem."

Flynn himself argues, however,that increased IQ scores do not necessarily mean that younger generations are more intelligent per se (Flynn,Shaughnessy, & Fulgham, 2012).Ultimately, we are still left with the question of how valid intelligence tests are. Certainly, the most modernversions of these tests tap into more than verbal competencies, yet the specific skills that should be assessedin IQ testing, the degree to which any test can truly measure an individual\u2019s intelligence, and the use of theresults of IQ tests are still issues of debate (Gresham & Witt, 1997; Flynn, Shaughnessy, & Fulgham, 2012;Richardson, 2002; Schlinger, 2003).WHAT DO YOU THINK?Capital Punishment and People with Intellectual DisabilitiesThe case of Atkins v. Virginiawas a landmark case in the United States Supreme Court. On August 16, 1996, twomen, Daryl Atkins and William Jones, robbed, kidnapped, and then shot and killed Eric Nesbitt, a local airmanfrom the U.S. Air Force. A clinical psychologist evaluated Atkins and testified at the trial that Atkins had an IQ of59. The mean IQ score is 100. The psychologist concluded that Atkins had an intellectual disability.The jury found Atkins guilty, and he was sentenced to death. Atkins and his attorneys appealed to the SupremeCourt. In June 2002, the Supreme Court reversed a previous decision and ruled that executions of people withintellectual disabilities are \u2018cruel and unusual punishments\u2019 prohibited by the Eighth Amendment. Using theaccepted language of the time, the court wrote in their decision:Clinical definitions of mental retardation require not only subaverage intellectual functioning, but alsosignificant limitations in adaptive skills. Mentally retarded persons frequently know the differencebetween right and wrong and are competent to stand trial. Because of their impairments, however, bydefinition they have diminished capacities to understand and process information, to communicate, toabstract from mistakes and learn from experience, to engage in logical reasoning, to control impulses,and to understand others\u2019 reactions. Their deficiencies do not warrant an exemption from criminalsanctions, but diminish their personal culpability (Atkins v. Virginia, 2002, par. 5).The court also decided that there was a state legislature consensus against the execution of people withintellectual disabilities and that this consensus should stand for all of the states. The Supreme Court ruling left itup to the states to determine their own definitions of intellectual disability. The definitions vary among states asto who can be executed. In the Atkins case, a jury decided that because he had many contacts with his lawyersand thus was provided with intellectual stimulation, his IQ had reportedly increased to a level where the statecould execute him. He was given an execution date and then received a stay of execution after it was revealedthat lawyers for co-defendant, William Jones, coached Jones to \u201cproduce a testimony against Mr. Atkins that didmatch the evidence\u201d (Liptak, 2008). After the revelation of this misconduct, Atkins was re-sentenced to lifeimprisonment.Atkins v. Virginia(2002) highlights several issues regarding society\u2019s beliefs around intelligence. In the Atkinscase, the Supreme Court decided that intellectual disability doesaffect decision making and therefore shouldaffect the nature of the punishment such criminals receive. Where, however, should the lines of intellectualdisability be drawn? In May 2014, the Supreme Court ruled in a related case (Hall v. Florida) that IQ scorescannot be used as a final determination of a prisoner\u2019s eligibility for the death penalty (Roberts, 2014).The Bell CurveThe results of intelligence tests follow the bell curve, a graph in the general shape of a bell.

Many human traits naturally follow the bell curve. For example, if youlined up all your female schoolmates according to height, it is likely that a large cluster of them would be theaverage height for an American woman: 5\u20194\u201d\u20135\u20196\u201d. This cluster would fall in the center of the bell curve,representing the average height for American women (Figure 7.14). There would be fewer women who standcloser to 4\u201911\u201d. The same would be true for women of above-average height: those who stand closer to 5\u201911\u201d.The trick to finding a bell curve in nature is to use a large sample size. Without a large sample size, it is lesslikely that the bell curve will represent the wider population. A representative sample is a subset of thepopulation that accurately represents the general population. If, for example, you measured the height of thewomen in your classroom only, you might not actually have a representative sample. Perhaps the women\u2019sbasketball team wanted to take this course together, and they are all in your class. Because basketball playerstend to be taller than average, the women in your class may not be a good representative sample of thepopulation of American women. But if your sample included all the women at your school, it is likely that theirheights would form a natural bell curve.FIGURE 7.14 Are you of below-average, average, or above-average height?The same principles apply to intelligence tests scores. Individuals earn a score called an intelligence quotient(IQ). Over the years, different types of IQ tests have evolved, but the way scores are interpreted remains thesame. On most IQ tests, the average (or mean) IQ score is 100. Standard deviations describe how data aredispersed in a population and give context to large data sets. The bell curve uses the standard deviation toshow how all scores are dispersed from the average score (Figure 7.15). In modern IQ testing, one standarddeviation is 15 points. So a score of 85 would be described as \u201cone standard deviation below the mean.\u201d Howwould you describe a score of 115 and a score of 70? Any IQ score that falls within one standard deviationabove and below the mean (between 85 and 115) is considered average, and 68% of the population has IQscores in this range. An IQ score of 130 or above is considered a superior level."

If aperson earns a score approximately two standard deviations below the mean on an intelligence test, (about 70on a test with a mean of 100), has major deficits in adaptive functioning, and these cognitive and adaptivedeficits were present before the age of 18, they could be diagnosed as having an intellectual disability (ID).Formerly known as mental retardation, the accepted term now is intellectual disability, and it has foursubtypes: mild, moderate, severe, and profound (Table 7.4).

Long ago, popular belief suggestedthat people of high intelligence were maladjusted. This idea was disproven through a groundbreaking study ofthese children.

Intellectual DisabilitiesIn the past, individuals with IQ scores below 70 and significant adaptive and social functioning delays werediagnosed with mental retardation. When this diagnosis was first named, it was replacing more negative andinsensitive terms, and the title held no social stigma; several prominent research and support organizations evenused the word in their names and mission statements. However, members of those populations as well as theirfamilies and supporting professionals found that the term was not only inaccurate, but demeaning and insulting.As such, the DSM-5 now labels this diagnosis as \u201cintellectual disability.\u201d Many states once had a Department ofMental Retardation to serve those diagnosed with such cognitive delays, but most have changed their name toDepartment of Developmental Disabilities or something similar in language. Due to the passage of \"Rosa's Law\"in 2010 and to the growing support for changing the terminology, most U.S. federal agencies formally adoptedthe words \"intellectual disability.\" While the change was widely supported, you can view in the Federal Registerseveral counterpoints from parents of people with intellectual disabilities, who felt that the new term wasimprecise and less applicable to their children. Earlier in the chapter, we discussed how language affects how wethink. Do you think changing the title of this department has any impact on how people regard those withdevelopmental disabilities? Does a different name give people more dignity, and if so, how? Do you think theterminology is likely to change again? Why or why not?Why Measure Intelligence?The value of IQ testing is most evident in educational or clinical settings. Children who seem to beexperiencing learning difficulties or severe behavioral problems can be tested to ascertain whether the child\u2019sdifficulties can be partly attributed to an IQ score that is significantly different from the mean for their agegroup. Without IQ testing\u2014or another measure of intelligence\u2014children and adults needing extra supportmight not be identified effectively. In addition, IQ testing is used in courts to determine whether a defendanthas special or extenuating circumstances that preclude them from participating in some way in a trial. Peoplealso use IQ testing results to seek disability benefits from the Social Security Administration.The following case study demonstrates the usefulness and benefits of IQ testing. Candace, a 14-year-old girlexperiencing problems at school in Connecticut, was referred for a court-ordered psychological evaluation.She was in regular education classes in ninth grade and was failing every subject. Candace had never been astellar student but had always been passed to the next grade. Frequently, she would curse at any of herteachers who called on her in class. She also got into fights with other students and occasionally shoplifted.When she arrived for the evaluation, Candace immediately said that she hated everything about school,including the teachers, the rest of the staff, the building, and the homework. Her parents stated that they felttheir daughter was picked on, because she was of a different ethnicity than the teachers and most of the otherstudents. When asked why she cursed at her teachers, Candace replied, \u201cThey only call on me when I don\u2019tknow the answer. I don\u2019t want to say, \u2018I don\u2019t know\u2019 all of the time and look like an idiot in front of my friends.The teachers embarrass me.\u201d She was given a battery of tests, including an IQ test. Her score on the IQ test was68. What does Candace\u2019s score say about her ability to excel or even succeed in regular education classeswithout assistance? Why were her difficulties never noticed or addressed?Despite evidence for the value of intelligence and related evaluations, the methods and interpretations of these"

They have a very lowincome, but they do their best to get by with what they have. She learns to read when she is just 3 years old. Asshe grows older, she longs to live with her mother, who now resides in Wisconsin. She moves there at the age of6 years. At 9 years of age, she is raped. During the next several years, several different male relativesrepeatedly molest her. Her life unravels. She turns to drugs and sex to fill the deep, lonely void inside her. Hermother then sends her to Nashville to live with her father, who imposes strict behavioral expectations uponher, and over time, her wild life settles once again. She begins to experience success in school, and at 19 yearsold, becomes the youngest and first African-American female news anchor (\u201cDates and Events,\u201d n.d.). Thewoman\u2014Oprah Winfrey\u2014goes on to become a media giant known for both her intelligence and her empathy.High Intelligence: Nature or Nurture?Where does high intelligence come from? Some researchers believe that intelligence is a trait inherited from aperson\u2019s parents. Scientists who research this topic typically use twin studies to determine the heritability ofintelligence. The Minnesota Study of Twins Reared Apart is one of the most well-known twin studies. In thisinvestigation, researchers found that identical twins raised together and identical twins raised apart exhibit ahigher correlation between their IQ scores than siblings or fraternal twins raised together (Bouchard, Lykken,McGue, Segal, & Tellegen, 1990). The findings from this study reveal a genetic component to intelligence(Figure 7.16). At the same time, other psychologists believe that intelligence is shaped by a child\u2019sdevelopmental environment. If parents were to provide their children with intellectual stimuli from beforethey are born, it is likely that they would absorb the benefits of that stimulation, and it would be reflected inintelligence levels.FIGURE 7.16 The correlations of IQs of unrelated versus related persons reared apart or together suggest a genetic"

In fact, one study suggests that although geneticsseem to be in control of the level of intelligence, the environmental influences provide both stability andchange to trigger manifestation of cognitive abilities (Bartels, Rietveld, Van Baal, & Boomsma, 2002). Certainly,there are behaviors that support the development of intelligence, but the genetic component of highintelligence should not be ignored. As with all heritable traits, however, it is not always possible to isolate howand when high intelligence is passed on to the next generation.Range of Reaction is the theory that each person responds to the environment in a unique way based on theirgenetic makeup. According to this idea, your genetic potential is a fixed quantity, but whether you reach yourfull intellectual potential is dependent upon the environmental stimulation you experience, especially inchildhood. Think about this scenario: A couple adopts a child who has average genetic intellectual potential.They raise her in an extremely stimulating environment. What will happen to the couple\u2019s new daughter? It islikely that the stimulating environment will improve her intellectual outcomes over the course of her life. Butwhat happens if this experiment is reversed? If a child with an extremely strong genetic background is placedin an environment that does not stimulate him: What happens? Interestingly, according to a longitudinal studyof highly gifted individuals, it was found that \u201cthe two extremes of optimal and pathological experience areboth represented disproportionately in the backgrounds of creative individuals\u201d; however, those whoexperienced supportive family environments were more likely to report being happy (Csikszentmihalyi &Csikszentmihalyi, 1993, p. 187).Another challenge to determining origins of high intelligence is the confounding nature of our human socialstructures. It is troubling to note that some ethnic groups perform better on IQ tests than others\u2014and it islikely that the results do not have much to do with the quality of each ethnic group\u2019s intellect. The same is truefor socioeconomic status. Children who live in poverty experience more pervasive, daily stress than childrenwho do not worry about the basic needs of safety, shelter, and food. These worries can negatively affect how thebrain functions and develops, causing a dip in IQ scores. Mark Kishiyama and his colleagues determined thatchildren living in poverty demonstrated reduced prefrontal brain functioning comparable to children withdamage to the lateral prefrontal cortex (Kishiyama, Boyce, Jimenez, Perry, & Knight, 2009).The debate around the foundations and influences on intelligence exploded in 1969, when an educationalpsychologist named Arthur Jensen published the article \u201cHow Much Can We Boost I.Q. and Achievement\u201d inthe Harvard Educational Review. Jensen had administered IQ tests to diverse groups of students, and hisresults led him to the conclusion that IQ is determined by genetics. He also posited that intelligence was madeup of two types of abilities: Level I and Level II. In his theory, Level I is responsible for rote memorization,whereas Level II is responsible for conceptual and analytical abilities. According to his findings, Level Iremained consistent among the human race. Level II, however, exhibited differences among ethnic groups(Modgil & Routledge, 1987). Jensen\u2019s most controversial conclusion was that Level II intelligence is prevalentamong Asian people, then White people, then Black people. Robert Williams was among those who called outracial bias in Jensen\u2019s results (Williams, 1970).Obviously, Jensen\u2019s interpretation of his own data caused an intense response in a nation that continued tograpple with the effects of racism (Fox, 2012). While even some who took issue with Jensen's findingsindicated that they did not detect overt racism in his work, Jensen himself made a number of racist statementsduring an interview with a White nationalist publication, American Renaissance. He indicated his belief thatmany Black people were not \"educable up to a level for which there\u2019s any economic demand,\" while also havinga higher birth rate than other groups, which would lead to a shift in population and a deterioration of thenation (Taylor, 1992). However, Jensen\u2019s ideas were not solitary or unique; rather, they represented one ofmany examples of psychologists asserting racial differences in IQ and cognitive ability. In fact, Rushton andJensen (2005) reviewed three decades worth of research on the relationship between race and cognitive ability.Jensen\u2019s belief in the inherited nature of intelligence and the validity of the IQ test to be the truest measure of"

Riles). The testingmethod used by the state disproportionately identified African American children as \u201cmentally retarded,\"which resulted in many students being incorrectly classified. According to a summary of the case, Larry P. v.Riles:In violation of Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, and the Educationfor All Handicapped Children Act of 1975, defendants have utilized standardized intelligence teststhat are racially and culturally biased, have a discriminatory impact against Black children, and havenot been validated for the purpose of essentially permanent placements of Black children intoeducationally dead-end, isolated, and stigmatizing classes for the so-called educable mentallyretarded. Further, these federal laws have been violated by defendants' general use of placementmechanisms that, taken together, have not been validated and result in a large over-representation ofBlack children in the special E.M.R. classes. (Larry P. v. Riles, par. 6)Once again, the limitations of intelligence testing were revealed.What are Learning Disabilities?Learning disabilities are cognitive disorders that affect different areas of cognition, particularly language orreading. It should be pointed out that learning disabilities are not the same thing as intellectual disabilities.Learning disabilities are considered specific neurological impairments rather than global intellectual ordevelopmental disabilities. A person with a language disability has difficulty understanding or using spokenlanguage, whereas someone with a reading disability, such as dyslexia, has difficulty processing what they arereading.Often, learning disabilities are not recognized until a child reaches school age. One confounding aspect oflearning disabilities is that they most often affect children with average to above-average intelligence. In otherwords, the disability is specific to a particular area and not a measure of overall intellectual ability. At the sametime, learning disabilities tend to exhibit comorbidity with other disorders, like attention-deficit hyperactivitydisorder (ADHD). Anywhere between 30\u201370% of individuals with diagnosed cases of ADHD also have some sortof learning disability (Riccio, Gonzales, & Hynd, 1994). Let\u2019s take a look at three examples of common learningdisabilities: dysgraphia, dyslexia, and dyscalculia.DysgraphiaChildren with dysgraphia have a learning disability that results in a struggle to write legibly. The physical taskof writing with a pen and paper is extremely challenging for the person. These children often have extremedifficulty putting their thoughts down on paper (Smits-Engelsman & Van Galen, 1997). This difficulty isinconsistent with a person\u2019s IQ. That is, based on the child\u2019s IQ and/or abilities in other areas, a child withdysgraphia should be able to write, but can\u2019t. Children with dysgraphia may also have problems with spatialabilities.Students with dysgraphia need academic accommodations to help them succeed in school. Theseaccommodations can provide students with alternative assessment opportunities to demonstrate what theyknow (Barton, 2003). For example, a student with dysgraphia might be permitted to take an oral exam ratherthan a traditional paper-and-pencil test. Treatment is usually provided by an occupational therapist, althoughthere is some question as to how effective such treatment is (Zwicker, 2005).DyslexiaDyslexia is the most common learning disability in children. An individual with dyslexia exhibits an inabilityto correctly process letters. The neurological mechanism for sound processing does not work properly in"

Achild with dyslexia may mix up letters within words and sentences\u2014letter reversals, such as those shown inFigure 7.17, are a hallmark of this learning disability\u2014or skip whole words while reading. A dyslexic child mayhave difficulty spelling words correctly while writing. Because of the disordered way that the brain processesletters and sound, learning to read is a frustrating experience. Some dyslexic individuals cope by memorizingthe shapes of most words, but they never actually learn to read (Berninger, 2008).FIGURE 7.17 These written words show variations of the word \u201cteapot\u201d as written by individuals with dyslexia.DyscalculiaDyscalculia is difficulty in learning or comprehending arithmetic. This learning disability is often first evidentwhen children exhibit difficulty discerning how many objects are in a small group without counting them.Other symptoms may include struggling to memorize math facts, organize numbers, or fully differentiatebetween numerals, math symbols, and written numbers (such as \u201c3\u201d and \u201cthree\u201d)."

Memory is the setof processes used to encode, store, and retrieve information over different periods of time (Figure 8.2).FIGURE 8.2 Encoding involves the input of information into the memory system. Storage is the retention of theencoded information. Retrieval, or getting the information out of memory and back into awareness, is the thirdfunction.LINK TO LEARNINGWatch this video about the neuroscience of memory (http://openstax.org/l/unexpectfact) to learn more.EncodingWe get information into our brains through a process called encoding, which is the input of information intothe memory system. Once we receive sensory information from the environment, our brains label or code it.We organize the information with other similar information and connect new concepts to existing concepts.Encoding information occurs through automatic processing and effortful processing.If someone asks you what you ate for lunch today, more than likely you could recall this information quiteeasily. This is known as automatic processing, or the encoding of details like time, space, frequency, and themeaning of words. Automatic processing is usually done without any conscious awareness. Recalling the lasttime you studied for a test is another example of automatic processing. But what about the actual test materialyou studied? It probably required a lot of work and attention on your part in order to encode that information.This is known as effortful processing (Figure 8.3).FIGURE 8.3 When you first learn new skills such as driving a car, you have to put forth effort and attention toencode information about how to start a car, how to brake, how to handle a turn, and so on. Once you know how todrive, you can encode additional information about this skill automatically.

The notes were sour because the seams split.2. The voyage wasn't delayed because the bottle shattered.3. The haystack was important because the cloth ripped.How well did you do? By themselves, the statements that you wrote down were most likely confusing anddifficult for you to recall. Now, try writing them again, using the following prompts: bagpipe, ship christening,and parachutist. Next count backwards from 40 by fours, then check yourself to see how well you recalled thesentences this time. You can see that the sentences are now much more memorable because each of thesentences was placed in context. Material is far better encoded when you make it meaningful.There are three types of encoding. The encoding of words and their meaning is known as semantic encoding.It was first demonstrated by William Bousfield (1935) in an experiment in which he asked people to memorizewords. The 60 words were actually divided into 4 categories of meaning, although the participants did notknow this because the words were randomly presented. When they were asked to remember the words, theytended to recall them in categories, showing that they paid attention to the meanings of the words as theylearned them.Visual encoding is the encoding of images, and acoustic encoding is the encoding of sounds, words inparticular. To see how visual encoding works, read over this list of words: car, level, dog, truth, book, value. Ifyou were asked later to recall the words from this list, which ones do you think you\u2019d most likely remember?You would probably have an easier time recalling the words car, dog,and book, and a more difficult timerecalling the words level, truth,and value. Why is this? Because you can recall images (mental pictures) moreeasily than words alone. When you read the words car, dog,and bookyou created images of these things inyour mind. These are concrete, high-imagery words. On the other hand, abstract words like level, truth,andvalueare low-imagery words. High-imagery words are encoded both visually and semantically (Paivio, 1986),thus building a stronger memory.Now let\u2019s turn our attention to acoustic encoding. You are driving in your car and a song comes on the radiothat you haven\u2019t heard in at least 10 years, but you sing along, recalling every word. In the United States,children often learn the alphabet through song, and they learn the number of days in each month throughrhyme: \u201cThirty days hath September, / April, June, and November; / All the rest have thirty-one, / SaveFebruary, with twenty-eight days clear, / And twenty-nine each leap year.\u201d These lessons are easy to rememberbecause of acoustic encoding. We encode the sounds the words make. This is one of the reasons why much ofwhat we teach young children is done through song, rhyme, and rhythm.Which of the three types of encoding do you think would give you the best memory of verbal information?Some years ago, psychologists Fergus Craik and Endel Tulving (1975) conducted a series of experiments tofind out. Participants were given words along with questions about them. The questions required theparticipants to process the words at one of the three levels. The visual processing questions included suchthings as asking the participants about the font of the letters. The acoustic processing questions asked theparticipants about the sound or rhyming of the words, and the semantic processing questions asked theparticipants about the meaning of the words. After participants were presented with the words and questions,they were given an unexpected recall or recognition task.Words that had been encoded semantically were better remembered than those encoded visually oracoustically. Semantic encoding involves a deeper level of processing than the shallower visual or acousticencoding. Craik and Tulving concluded that we process verbal information best through semantic encoding,especially if we apply what is called the self-reference effect. The self-reference effect is the tendency for anindividual to have better memory for information that relates to oneself in comparison to material that has lesspersonal relevance (Rogers, Kuiper, & Kirker, 1977). Could semantic encoding be beneficial to you as you"

Our brains take the encodedinformation and place it in storage. Storage is the creation of a permanent record of information.In order for a memory to go into storage (i.e., long-term memory), it has to pass through three distinct stages:Sensory Memory, Short-Term Memory, and finally Long-Term Memory. These stages were first proposed byRichard Atkinson and Richard Shiffrin (1968). Their model of human memory (Figure 8.4), called Atkinsonand Shiffrin's model, is based on the belief that we process memories in the same way that a computerprocesses information.FIGURE 8.4 According to the Atkinson-Shiffrin model of memory, information passes through three distinct stagesin order for it to be stored in long-term memory.Atkinson and Shiffrin's model is not the only model of memory. Baddeley and Hitch (1974) proposed a workingmemory model in which short-term memory has different forms. In their model, storing memories in short-term memory is like opening different files on a computer and adding information. The working memory fileshold a limited amount of information. The type of short-term memory (or computer file) depends on the typeof information received. There are memories in visual-spatial form, as well as memories of spoken or writtenmaterial, and they are stored in three short-term systems: a visuospatial sketchpad, an episodic buffer(Baddeley, 2000), and a phonological loop. According to Baddeley and Hitch, a central executive part ofmemory supervises or controls the flow of information to and from the three short-term systems, and thecentral executive is responsible for moving information into long-term memory.Sensory MemoryIn the Atkinson-Shiffrin model, stimuli from the environment are processed first in sensory memory: storageof brief sensory events, such as sights, sounds, and tastes. It is very brief storage\u2014up to a couple of seconds. Weare constantly bombarded with sensory information. We cannot absorb all of it, or even most of it. And most ofit has no impact on our lives. For example, what was your professor wearing the last class period? As long asthe professor was dressed appropriately, it does not really matter what she was wearing. Sensory informationabout sights, sounds, smells, and even textures, which we do not view as valuable information, we discard. Ifwe view something as valuable, the information will move into our short-term memory system.Short-Term MemoryShort-term memory (STM) is a temporary storage system that processes incoming sensory memory. Theterms short-term and working memory are sometimes used interchangeably, but they are not exactly thesame. Short-term memory is more accurately described as a component of working memory. Short-termmemory takes information from sensory memory and sometimes connects that memory to something already"

Think of it as the information youhave displayed on your computer screen, such as a document, spreadsheet, or website. Then, information inSTM goes to long-term memory (you save it to your hard drive), or it is discarded (you delete a document orclose a web browser).Rehearsal moves information from short-term memory to long-term memory. Active rehearsal is a way ofattending to information to move it from short-term to long-term memory. During active rehearsal, you repeat(practice) the information to be remembered. If you repeat it enough, it may be moved into long-term memory.For example, this type of active rehearsal is the way many children learn their ABCs by singing the alphabetsong. Alternatively, elaborative rehearsal is the act of linking new information you are trying to learn toexisting information that you already know. For example, if you meet someone at a party and your phone isdead but you want to remember his phone number, which starts with area code 203, you might remember thatyour uncle Abdul lives in Connecticut and has a 203 area code. This way, when you try to remember the phonenumber of your new prospective friend, you will easily remember the area code. Craik and Lockhart (1972)proposed the levels of processing hypothesis that states the deeper you think about something, the better youremember it.You may find yourself asking, \u201cHow much information can our memory handle at once?\u201d To explore thecapacity and duration of your short-term memory, have a partner read the strings of random numbers (Figure8.5) out loud to you, beginning each string by saying, \u201cReady?\u201d and ending each by saying, \u201cRecall,\u201d at whichpoint you should try to write down the string of numbers from memory.FIGURE 8.5 Work through this series of numbers using the recall exercise explained above to determine the longeststring of digits that you can store.Note the longest string at which you got the series correct. For most people, the capacity will probably be closeto 7 plus or minus 2. In 1956, George Miller reviewed most of the research on the capacity of short-termmemory and found that people can retain between 5 and 9 items, so he reported the capacity of short-termmemory was the \"magic number\" 7 plus or minus 2. However, more contemporary research has foundworking memory capacity is 4 plus or minus 1 (Cowan, 2010). Generally, recall is somewhat better for randomnumbers than for random letters (Jacobs, 1887) and also often slightly better for information we hear (acousticencoding) rather than information we see (visual encoding) (Anderson, 1969).Memory trace decay and interference are two factors that affect short-term memory retention. Peterson andPeterson (1959) investigated short-term memory using the three letter sequences called trigrams (e.g., CLS)that had to be recalled after various time intervals between 3 and 18 seconds. Participants remembered about80% of the trigrams after a 3-second delay, but only 10% after a delay of 18 seconds, which caused them toconclude that short-term memory decayed in 18 seconds. During decay, the memory trace becomes lessactivated over time, and the information is forgotten. However, Keppel and Underwood (1962) examined onlythe first trials of the trigram task and found that proactive interference also affected short-term memoryretention. During proactive interference, previously learned information interferes with the ability to learnnew information. Both memory trace decay and proactive interference affect short-term memory. Once theinformation reaches long-term memory, it has to be consolidated at both the synaptic level, which takes a fewhours, and into the memory system, which can take weeks or longer.Long-term MemoryLong-term memory (LTM) is the continuous storage of information. Unlike short-term memory, long-termmemory storage capacity is believed to be unlimited. It encompasses all the things you can remember thathappened more than just a few minutes ago. One cannot really consider long-term memory without thinkingabout the way it is organized. Really quickly, what is the first word that comes to mind when you hear \u201cpeanut"

Itis generally accepted that memories are organized in semantic (or associative) networks (Collins & Loftus,1975). A semantic network consists of concepts, and as you may recall from what you\u2019ve learned aboutmemory, concepts are categories or groupings of linguistic information, images, ideas, or memories, such aslife experiences. Although individual experiences and expertise can affect concept arrangement, concepts arebelieved to be arranged hierarchically in the mind (Anderson & Reder, 1999; Johnson & Mervis, 1997, 1998;Palmer, Jones, Hennessy, Unze, & Pick, 1989; Rosch, Mervis, Gray, Johnson, & Boyes-Braem, 1976; Tanaka &Taylor, 1991). Related concepts are linked, and the strength of the link depends on how often two conceptshave been associated.Semantic networks differ depending on personal experiences. Importantly for memory, activating any part of asemantic network also activates the concepts linked to that part to a lesser degree. The process is known asspreading activation (Collins & Loftus, 1975). If one part of a network is activated, it is easier to access theassociated concepts because they are already partially activated. When you remember or recall something,you activate a concept, and the related concepts are more easily remembered because they are partiallyactivated. However, the activations do not spread in just one direction. When you remember something, youusually have several routes to get the information you are trying to access, and the more links you have to aconcept, the better your chances of remembering.There are two types of long-term memory: explicitand implicit(Figure 8.6). Understanding the differencebetween explicit memory and implicit memory is important because aging, particular types of brain trauma,and certain disorders can impact explicit and implicit memory in different ways. Explicit memories are thosewe consciously try to remember, recall, and report. For example, if you are studying for your chemistry exam,the material you are learning will be part of your explicit memory. In keeping with the computer analogy, someinformation in your long-term memory would be like the information you have saved on the hard drive. It isnot there on your desktop (your short-term memory), but most of the time you can pull up this informationwhen you want it. Not all long-term memories are strong memories, and some memories can only be recalledusing prompts. For example, you might easily recall a fact, such as the capital of the United States, but youmight struggle to recall the name of the restaurant at which you had dinner when you visited a nearby city lastsummer. A prompt, such as that the restaurant was named after its owner, might help you recall the name ofthe restaurant. Explicit memory is sometimes referred to as declarative memory, because it can be put intowords. Explicit memory is divided into episodic memory and semantic memory.LINK TO LEARNINGView this video that explains short-term and long-term memory (http://openstax.org/l/HMbrain) to learn moreabout how memories are stored and retrieved.Episodic memory is information about events we have personally experienced (i.e., an episode). For instance,the memory of your last birthday is an episodic memory. Usually, episodic memory is reported as a story. Theconcept of episodic memory was first proposed about in the 1970s (Tulving, 1972). Since then, Tulving andothers have reformulated the theory, and currently scientists believe that episodic memory is memory abouthappenings in particular places at particular times\u2014the what, where, and when of an event (Tulving, 2002). Itinvolves recollection of visual imagery as well as the feeling of familiarity (Hassabis & Maguire, 2007).Semantic memory is knowledge about words, concepts, and language-based knowledge and facts. Semanticmemory is typically reported as facts. Semantic means having to do with language and knowledge aboutlanguage. For example, answers to the following questions like \u201cwhat is the definition of psychology\u201d and \u201cwhowas the first African American president of the United States\u201d are stored in your semantic memory.Implicit memories are long-term memories that are not part of our consciousness. Although implicitmemories are learned outside of our awareness and cannot be consciously recalled, implicit memory isdemonstrated in the performance of some task (Roediger, 1990; Schacter, 1987).

Returning to the computermetaphor, implicit memories are like a program running in the background, and you are not aware of theirinfluence. Implicit memories can influence observable behaviors as well as cognitive tasks. In either case, youusually cannot put the memory into words that adequately describe the task. There are several types ofimplicit memories, including procedural, priming, and emotional conditioning.FIGURE 8.6 There are two components of long-term memory: explicit and implicit. Explicit memory includesepisodic and semantic memory. Implicit memory includes procedural memory and things learned throughconditioning.Implicit procedural memory is often studied using observable behaviors (Adams, 1957; Lacey & Smith, 1954;Lazarus & McCleary, 1951). Implicit procedural memory stores information about the way to do something,and it is the memory for skilled actions, such as brushing your teeth, riding a bicycle, or driving a car. You wereprobably not that good at riding a bicycle or driving a car the first time you tried, but you were much betterafter doing those things for a year. Your improved bicycle riding was due to learning balancing abilities. Youlikely thoughtabout staying upright in the beginning, but now you just doit. Moreover, you probably are goodat staying balanced, but cannot tell someone the exact way you do it. Similarly, when you first learned to drive,you probably thought about a lot of things that you just do now without much thought. When you first learnedto do these tasks, someone may have told you how to do them, but everything you learned since thoseinstructions that you cannot readily explain to someone else as the way to do it is implicit memory.Implicit priming is another type of implicit memory (Schacter, 1992). During priming exposure to a stimulusaffects the response to a later stimulus. Stimuli can vary and may include words, pictures, and other stimuli toelicit a response or increase recognition. For instance, some people really enjoy picnics. They love going intonature, spreading a blanket on the ground, and eating a delicious meal. Now, unscramble the following lettersto make a word.What word did you come up with? Chances are good that it was \"plate.\"Had you read, \u201cSome people really enjoy growing flowers.

The reason people are more likely to come up with\u201cplate\u201d after reading about a picnic is that plate is associated (linked) with picnic. Plate was primed byactivating the semantic network. Similarly, \u201cpetal\u201d is linked to flower and is primed by flower. Priming is alsothe reason you probably said jelly in response to peanut butter.Implicit emotional conditioning is the type of memory involved in classically conditioned emotion responses(Olson & Fazio, 2001). These emotional relationships cannot be reported or recalled but can be associated withdifferent stimuli. For example, specific smells can cause specific emotional responses for some people. If thereis a smell that makes you feel positive and nostalgic, and you don't know where that response comes from, it isan implicit emotional response. Similarly, most people have a song that causes a specific emotional response.That song's effect could be an implicit emotional memory (Yang, Xu, Du, Shi, & Fang, 2011).EVERYDAY CONNECTIONCan You Remember Everything You Ever Did or Said?Episodic memories are also called autobiographical memories. Let\u2019s quickly test your autobiographical memory.What were you wearing exactly five years ago today? What did you eat for lunch on April 10, 2009? You probablyfind it difficult, if not impossible, to answer these questions. Can you remember every event you haveexperienced over the course of your life\u2014meals, conversations, clothing choices, weather conditions, and so on?Most likely none of us could even come close to answering these questions; however, American actress MariluHenner, best known for the television show Taxi,can remember. She has an amazing and highly superiorautobiographical memory (Figure 8.7).FIGURE 8.7 Marilu Henner\u2019s super autobiographical memory is known as hyperthymesia. (credit: MarkRichardson)Very few people can recall events in this way; right now, fewer than 20 have been identified as having this ability,and only a few have been studied (Parker, Cahill & McGaugh 2006).

You must be able to retrieve information from memory in order to doeverything from knowing how to brush your hair and teeth, to driving to work, to knowing how to perform yourjob once you get there.There are three ways you can retrieve information out of your long-term memory storage system: recall,recognition, and relearning. Recall is what we most often think about when we talk about memory retrieval: itmeans you can access information without cues. For example, you would use recall for an essay test.Recognition happens when you identify information that you have previously learned after encountering itagain. It involves a process of comparison. When you take a multiple-choice test, you are relying onrecognition to help you choose the correct answer. Here is another example. Let\u2019s say you graduated from highschool 10 years ago, and you have returned to your hometown for your 10-year reunion.

It involves learning information thatyou previously learned. Whitney took Spanish in high school, but after high school she did not have theopportunity to speak Spanish.

KarlLashley began exploring this problem, about 100 years ago, by making lesions in the brains of animals such asrats and monkeys. He was searching for evidence of the engram: the group of neurons that serve as the\u201cphysical representation of memory\u201d (Josselyn, 2010). First, Lashley (1950) trained rats to find their waythrough a maze. Then, he used the tools available at the time\u2014in this case a soldering iron\u2014to create lesions inthe rats\u2019 brains, specifically in the cerebral cortex. He did this because he was trying to erase the engram, orthe original memory trace that the rats had of the maze.Lashley did not find evidence of the engram, and the rats were still able to find their way through the maze,regardless of the size or location of the lesion. Based on his creation of lesions and the animals\u2019 reaction, heformulated the equipotentiality hypothesis: if part of one area of the brain involved in memory is damaged,another part of the same area can take over that memory function (Lashley, 1950). Although Lashley\u2019s earlywork did not confirm the existence of the engram, modern psychologists are making progress locating it. Forexample, Eric Kandel has spent decades studying the synapse and its role in controlling the flow of informationthrough neural circuits needed to store memories (Mayford, Siegelbaum, & Kandel, 2012).Many scientists believe that the entire brain is involved with memory. However, since Lashley\u2019s research, otherscientists have been able to look more closely at the brain and memory. They have argued that memory islocated in specific parts of the brain, and specific neurons can be recognized for their involvement in formingmemories. The main parts of the brain involved with memory are the amygdala, the hippocampus, thecerebellum, and the prefrontal cortex (Figure 8.8)."

The hippocampus is associated with declarativeand episodic memory as well as recognition memory. The cerebellum plays a role in processing proceduralmemories, such as how to play the piano. The prefrontal cortex appears to be involved in remembering semantictasks.The AmygdalaFirst, let\u2019s look at the role of the amygdala in memory formation. The main job of the amygdala is to regulateemotions, such as fear and aggression (Figure 8.8). The amygdala plays a part in how memories are storedbecause storage is influenced by stress hormones. For example, one researcher experimented with rats andthe fear response (Josselyn, 2010). Using Pavlovian conditioning, a neutral tone was paired with a foot shock tothe rats. This produced a fear memory in the rats. After being conditioned, each time they heard the tone, theywould freeze (a defense response in rats), indicating a memory for the impending shock. Then the researchersinduced cell death in neurons in the lateral amygdala, which is the specific area of the brain responsible forfear memories. They found the fear memory faded (became extinct). Because of its role in processingemotional information, the amygdala is also involved in memory consolidation: the process of transferringnew learning into long-term memory. The amygdala seems to facilitate encoding memories at a deeper levelwhen the event is emotionally arousing.LINK TO LEARNINGIn this TED Talk called \u201cA Mouse. A Laser Beam.

They created lesions in the hippocampi of the rats, and found that the ratsdemonstrated memory impairment on various tasks, such as object recognition and maze running. Theyconcluded that the hippocampus is involved in memory, specifically normal recognition memory as well asspatial memory (when the memory tasks are like recall tests) (Clark, Zola, & Squire, 2000). Another job of thehippocampus is to project information to cortical regions that give memories meaning and connect them withother memories. It also plays a part in memory consolidation: the process of transferring new learning intolong-term memory.Injury to this area leaves us unable to process new declarative memories.

When researchers damaged the cerebellums ofrabbits, they discovered that the rabbits were not able to learn the conditioned eye-blink response (Steinmetz,1999; Green & Woodruff-Pak, 2000).Other researchers have used brain scans, including positron emission tomography (PET) scans, to learn howpeople process and retain information. From these studies, it seems the prefrontal cortex is involved. In onestudy, participants had to complete two different tasks: either looking for the letter ain words (considered aperceptual task) or categorizing a noun as either living or non-living (considered a semantic task) (Kapur et al.,1994). Participants were then asked which words they had previously seen. Recall was much better for thesemantic task than for the perceptual task. According to PET scans, there was much more activation in the leftinferior prefrontal cortex in the semantic task. In another study, encoding was associated with left frontalactivity, while retrieval of information was associated with the right frontal region (Craik et al., 1999).NeurotransmittersThere also appear to be specific neurotransmitters involved with the process of memory, such as epinephrine,dopamine, serotonin, glutamate, and acetylcholine (Myhrer, 2003). There continues to be discussion anddebate among researchers as to which neurotransmitter plays which specific role (Blockland, 1996). Althoughwe don\u2019t yet know which role each neurotransmitter plays in memory, we do know that communication amongneurons via neurotransmitters is critical for developing new memories. Repeated activity by neurons leads toincreased neurotransmitters in the synapses and more efficient and more synaptic connections. This is howmemory consolidation occurs.It is also believed that strong emotions trigger the formation of strong memories, and weaker emotionalexperiences form weaker memories; this is called arousal theory (Christianson, 1992). For example, strongemotional experiences can trigger the release of neurotransmitters, as well as hormones, which strengthenmemory; therefore, our memory for an emotional event is usually better than our memory for a non-emotionalevent. When humans and animals are stressed, the brain secretes more of the neurotransmitter glutamate,which helps them remember the stressful event (McGaugh, 2003). This is clearly evidenced by what is knownas the flashbulb memory phenomenon.A flashbulb memory is an exceptionally clear recollection of an important event (Figure 8.9). Many peoplewho have lived through historic and momentous events can recall exactly where they were and how they heardabout them. For example, a Pew Research Center (2011) survey found that for those Americans who were age 8or older at the time of 9/11 terrorist attacks, 97% can recall the moment they learned of this event, even adecade after it happened. Many widely discussed examples of flashbulb memories pertain to national or globalevents, but according to their initial definition by researchers Brown and Kulik (1977) as well as additionalwork by more recent researchers, such a widely shared event is not required (Hirst & Phelps, 2016). Familymembers might always remember how they heard about an important event in their lives, or people in aschool may recall nearly everything about the way they experienced a major event in that setting. Andalthough most studies (and many conversations) involve negative memories, positive events can also elicitflashbulb memories."

(credit: Michael Foran)DIG DEEPERInaccurate and False MemoriesEven flashbulb memories for important events can have decreased accuracy with the passage of time. Forexample, on at least three occasions, when asked how he heard about the terrorist attacks of 9/11, PresidentGeorge W. Bush responded inaccurately. In January 2002, less than 4 months after the attacks, the then sittingPresident Bush was asked how he heard about the attacks. He responded:I was sitting there, and my Chief of Staff\u2014well, first of all, when we walked into the classroom, I hadseen this plane fly into the first building. There was a TV set on. And you know, I thought it was piloterror and I was amazed that anybody could make such a terrible mistake. (Greenberg, 2004, p. 2)Contrary to what President Bush stated, no one saw the first plane hit, except people on the ground near the twintowers. Video footage of the first plane was not recorded because it was a normal Tuesday morning, until the firstplane hit.Memory is not like a video recording. Human memory, even flashbulb memories, can be frail. Different parts ofthem, such as the time, visual elements, and smells, are stored in different places. When something isremembered, these components have to be put back together for the complete memory, which is known asmemory reconstruction. Each component creates a chance for an error to occur. False memory is rememberingsomething that did not happen. Research participants have recalled hearing a word, even though they neverheard the word (Roediger & McDermott, 2000).Do you remember where you were when you heard about a historic or perhaps a tragic event? Who were you withand what were you doing? What did you talk about? Can you contact those people you were with? Do they havethe same memories as you or do they have different memories?"

Cheese\u2019s.However, all of us have at times felt frustrated, and even embarrassed, when our memories have failed us.There are several reasons why this happens.AmnesiaAmnesia is the loss of long-term memory that occurs as the result of disease, physical trauma, orpsychological trauma. Endel Tulving (2002) and his colleagues at the University of Toronto studied K. C. foryears. K. C. suffered a traumatic head injury in a motorcycle accident and then had severe amnesia. Tulvingwrites,the outstanding fact about K.C.'s mental make-up is his utter inability to remember any events,circumstances, or situations from his own life. His episodic amnesia covers his whole life, from birthto the present. The only exception is the experiences that, at any time, he has had in the last minute ortwo. (Tulving, 2002, p. 14)Anterograde AmnesiaThere are two common types of amnesia: anterograde amnesia and retrograde amnesia (Figure 8.10).Anterograde amnesia is commonly caused by brain trauma, such as a blow to the head. With anterogradeamnesia, you cannot remember new information, although you can remember information and events thathappened prior to your injury. The hippocampus is usually affected (McLeod, 2011). This suggests thatdamage to the brain has resulted in the inability to transfer information from short-term to long-termmemory; that is, the inability to consolidate memories.Many people with this form of amnesia are unable to form new episodic or semantic memories, but are stillable to form new procedural memories (Bayley & Squire, 2002). This was true of H. M., which was discussedearlier. The brain damage caused by his surgery resulted in anterograde amnesia. H. M. would read the samemagazine over and over, having no memory of ever reading it\u2014it was always new to him. He also could notremember people he had met after his surgery. If you were introduced to H. M. and then you left the room for afew minutes, he would not know you upon your return and would introduce himself to you again. However,when presented the same puzzle several days in a row, although he did not remember having seen the puzzlebefore, his speed at solving it became faster each day (because of relearning) (Corkin, 1965, 1968).FIGURE 8.10 This diagram illustrates the timeline of retrograde and anterograde amnesia. Memory problems thatextend back in time before the injury and prevent retrieval of information previously stored in long-term memory areknown as retrograde amnesia. Conversely, memory problems that extend forward in time from the point of injuryand prevent the formation of new memories are called anterograde amnesia."

People with retrogradeamnesia cannot remember some or even all of their past. They have difficulty remembering episodicmemories. What if you woke up in the hospital one day and there were people surrounding your bed claimingto be your spouse, your children, and your parents? The trouble is you don\u2019t recognize any of them. You were ina car accident, suffered a head injury, and now have retrograde amnesia. You don\u2019t remember anything aboutyour life prior to waking up in the hospital. This may sound like the stuff of Hollywood movies, and Hollywoodhas been fascinated with the amnesia plot for nearly a century, going all the way back to the film Garden of Liesfrom 1915 to more recent movies such as the Jason Bourne spy thrillers. However, for real-life sufferers ofretrograde amnesia, like former NFL football player Scott Bolzan, the story is not a Hollywood movie. Bolzanfell, hit his head, and deleted 46 years of his life in an instant. He is now living with one of the most extremecases of retrograde amnesia on record.LINK TO LEARNINGView the video story about Scott Bolzan's amnesia and his attempts to get his life back (http://openstax.org/l/bolzan) to learn more.Memory Construction and ReconstructionThe formulation of new memories is sometimes called construction, and the process of bringing up oldmemories is called reconstruction. Yet as we retrieve our memories, we also tend to alter and modify them. Amemory pulled from long-term storage into short-term memory is flexible. New events can be added and wecan change what we think we remember about past events, resulting in inaccuracies and distortions. Peoplemay not intend to distort facts, but it can happen in the process of retrieving old memories and combiningthem with new memories (Roediger & DeSoto, 2015).SuggestibilityWhen someone witnesses a crime, that person\u2019s memory of the details of the crime is very important incatching the suspect. Because memory is so fragile, witnesses can be easily (and often accidentally) misled dueto the problem of suggestibility. Suggestibility describes the effects of misinformation from external sourcesthat leads to the creation of false memories. In the fall of 2002, a sniper in the DC area shot people at a gasstation, leaving Home Depot, and walking down the street. These attacks went on in a variety of places for overthree weeks and resulted in the deaths of ten people. During this time, as you can imagine, people wereterrified to leave their homes, go shopping, or even walk through their neighborhoods. Police officers and theFBI worked frantically to solve the crimes, and a tip hotline was set up. Law enforcement received over 140,000tips, which resulted in approximately 35,000 possible suspects (Newseum, n.d.).Most of the tips were dead ends, until a white van was spotted at the site of one of the shootings. The policechief went on national television with a picture of the white van. After the news conference, several othereyewitnesses called to say that they too had seen a white van fleeing from the scene of the shooting. At thetime, there were more than 70,000 white vans in the area. Police officers, as well as the general public, focusedalmost exclusively on white vans because they believed the eyewitnesses. Other tips were ignored. When thesuspects were finally caught, they were driving a blue sedan.As illustrated by this example, we are vulnerable to the power of suggestion, simply based on something we seeon the news. Or we can claim to remember something that in fact is only a suggestion someone made. It is thesuggestion that is the cause of the false memory.Eyewitness MisidentificationEven though memory and the process of reconstruction can be fragile, police officers, prosecutors, and the"

However, faultyeyewitness identification and testimony can lead to wrongful convictions (Figure 8.11).8.3 \u2022 Problems with Memory 261FIGURE 8.11 In studying cases where DNA evidence has exonerated people from crimes, the Innocence Projectdiscovered that eyewitness misidentification is the leading cause of wrongful convictions (Benjamin N. CardozoSchool of Law, Yeshiva University, 2009).How does this happen? In 1984, Jennifer Thompson, then a 22-year-old college student in North Carolina, wasbrutally raped at knifepoint. As she was being raped, she tried to memorize every detail of her rapist\u2019s face andphysical characteristics, vowing that if she survived, she would help get him convicted. After the police werecontacted, a composite sketch was made of the suspect, and Jennifer was shown six photos. She chose two, oneof which was of Ronald Cotton. After looking at the photos for 4\u20135 minutes, she said, \u201cYeah. This is the one,\u201dand then she added, \u201cI think this is the guy.\u201d When questioned about this by the detective who asked, \u201cYou\u2019resure? Positive?\u201d She said that it was him. Then she asked the detective if she did OK, and he reinforced herchoice by telling her she did great. These kinds of unintended cues and suggestions by police officers can leadwitnesses to identify the wrong suspect. The district attorney was concerned about her lack of certainty thefirst time, so she viewed a lineup of seven men. She said she was trying to decide between numbers 4 and 5,finally deciding that Cotton, number 5, \u201cLooks most like him.\u201d He was 22 years old.By the time the trial began, Jennifer Thompson had absolutely no doubt that she was raped by Ronald Cotton.She testified at the court hearing, and her testimony was compelling enough that it helped convict him. Howdid she go from, \u201cI think it\u2019s the guy\u201d and it \u201cLooks most like him,\u201d to such certainty? Gary Wells and DeahQuinlivan (2009) assert it\u2019s suggestive police identification procedures, such as stacking lineups to make thedefendant stand out, telling the witness which person to identify, and confirming witnesses choices by tellingthem \u201cGood choice,\u201d or \u201cYou picked the guy.\u201dAfter Cotton was convicted of the rape, he was sent to prison for life plus 50 years. After 4 years in prison, hewas able to get a new trial. Jennifer Thompson once again testified against him. This time Ronald Cotton wasgiven two life sentences. After serving 11 years in prison, DNA evidence finally demonstrated that RonaldCotton did not commit the rape, was innocent, and had served over a decade in prison for a crime he did notcommit.LINK TO LEARNINGWatch this first video about Ronald Cotton who was falsely convicted (http://openstax.org/l/Cotton1) and thenwatch this second video about the task of his accuser (http://openstax.org/l/Cotton2) to learn more about thefallibility of memory."

When Elizabeth was 14 years old andfast asleep in her bed at home, she was abducted at knifepoint. Her nine-year-old sister, Mary Katherine, wassleeping in the same bed and watched, terrified, as her beloved older sister was abducted. Mary Katherine wasthe sole eyewitness to this crime and was very fearful. In the following weeks, the Salt Lake City police and theFBI proceeded with caution with Mary Katherine. They did not want to implant any false memories or mislead herin any way. They did not show her police line-ups or push her to do a composite sketch of the abductor. Theyknew if they corrupted her memory, Elizabeth might never be found. For several months, there was little or noprogress on the case. Then, about 4 months after the kidnapping, Mary Katherine first recalled that she hadheard the abductor\u2019s voice prior to that night (he had worked exactly one day as a handyman at the family\u2019shome) and then she was able to name the person whose voice it was. The family contacted the press and othersrecognized him\u2014after a total of nine months, the suspect was caught and Elizabeth Smart was returned to herfamily.The Misinformation EffectCognitive psychologist Elizabeth Loftus has conducted extensive research on memory. She has studied falsememories as well as recovered memories of childhood sexual abuse. Loftus also developed themisinformation effect paradigm, which holds that after exposure to additional and possibly inaccurateinformation, a person may misremember the original event.According to Loftus, an eyewitness\u2019s memory of an event is very flexible due to the misinformation effect. Totest this theory, Loftus and John Palmer (1974) asked 45 U.S. college students to estimate the speed of carsusing different forms of questions (Figure 8.12). The participants were shown films of car accidents and wereasked to play the role of the eyewitness and describe what happened. They were asked, \u201cAbout how fast werethe cars going when they (smashed, collided, bumped, hit, contacted) each other?\u201d The participants estimatedthe speed of the cars based on the verb used.Participants who heard the word \u201csmashed\u201d estimated that the cars were traveling at a much higher speedthan participants who heard the word \u201ccontacted.\u201d The implied information about speed, based on the verbthey heard, had an effect on the participants\u2019 memory of the accident. In a follow-up one week later,participants were asked if they saw any broken glass (none was shown in the accident pictures). Participantswho had been in the \u201csmashed\u201d group were more than twice as likely to indicate that they did rememberseeing glass. Loftus and Palmer demonstrated that a leading question encouraged them to not only rememberthe cars were going faster, but to also falsely remember that they saw broken glass."

The idea that memories of traumatic events could be repressed has been a theme in the field ofpsychology, beginning with Sigmund Freud, and the controversy surrounding the idea continues today.Recall of false autobiographical memories is called false memory syndrome. This syndrome has received a lotof publicity, particularly as it relates to memories of events that do not have independent witnesses\u2014often theonly witnesses to the abuse are the perpetrator and the victim (e.g., sexual abuse).On one side of the debate are those who have recovered memories of childhood abuse years after it occurred.These researchers argue that some children\u2019s experiences have been so traumatizing and distressing that theymust lock those memories away in order to lead some semblance of a normal life. They believe that repressedmemories can be locked away for decades and later recalled intact through hypnosis and guided imagerytechniques (Devilly, 2007).Research suggests that having no memory of childhood sexual abuse is quite common in adults. For instance,one large-scale study conducted by John Briere and Jon Conte (1993) revealed that 59% of 450 men andwomen who were receiving treatment for sexual abuse that had occurred before age 18 had forgotten theirexperiences. Ross Cheit (2007) suggested that repressing these memories created psychological distress inadulthood. The Recovered Memory Project was created so that victims of childhood sexual abuse can recallthese memories and allow the healing process to begin (Cheit, 2007; Devilly, 2007).On the other side, Loftus has challenged the idea that individuals can repress memories of traumatic eventsfrom childhood, including sexual abuse, and then recover those memories years later through therapeutictechniques such as hypnosis, guided visualization, and age regression.Loftus is not saying that childhood sexual abuse doesn\u2019t happen, but she does question whether or not thosememories are accurate, and she is skeptical of the questioning process used to access these memories, giventhat even the slightest suggestion from the therapist can lead to misinformation effects. For example,researchers Stephen Ceci and Maggie Brucks (1993, 1995) asked three-year-old children to use ananatomically correct doll to show where their pediatricians had touched them during an exam. Fifty-fivepercent of the children pointed to the genital/anal area on the dolls, even when they had not received any formof genital exam."

Consequently, steps have been taken to decrease suggestibility of witnesses. One way is to modifyhow witnesses are questioned. When interviewers use neutral and less leading language, children moreaccurately recall what happened and who was involved (Goodman, 2006; Pipe, 1996; Pipe, Lamb, Orbach, &Esplin, 2004). Another change is in how police lineups are conducted. It\u2019s recommended that a blind photolineup be used. This way the person administering the lineup doesn\u2019t know which photo belongs to thesuspect, minimizing the possibility of giving leading cues. Additionally, judges in some states now informjurors about the possibility of misidentification. Judges can also suppress eyewitness testimony if they deem itunreliable.Forgetting\u201cI\u2019ve a grand memory for forgetting,\u201d quipped Robert Louis Stevenson. Forgetting refers to loss of informationfrom long-term memory. We all forget things, like a loved one\u2019s birthday, someone\u2019s name, or where we put ourcar keys. As you\u2019ve come to see, memory is fragile, and forgetting can be frustrating and even embarrassing.But why do we forget? To answer this question, we will look at several perspectives on forgetting.Encoding FailureSometimes memory loss happens before the actual memory process begins, which is encoding failure. Wecan\u2019t remember something if we never stored it in our memory in the first place. This would be like trying tofind a book on your e-reader that you never actually purchased and downloaded. Often, in order to remembersomething, we must pay attention to the details and actively work to process the information (effortfulencoding). Lots of times we don\u2019t do this. For instance, think of how many times in your life you\u2019ve seen apenny. Can you accurately recall what the front of a U.S. penny looks like? When researchers RaymondNickerson and Marilyn Adams (1979) asked this question, they found that most Americans don\u2019t know whichone it is. The reason is most likely encoding failure. Most of us never encode the details of the penny. We onlyencode enough information to be able to distinguish it from other coins. If we don\u2019t encode the information,then it\u2019s not in our long-term memory, so we will not be able to remember it.FIGURE 8.13 Can you tell which coin, (a), (b), (c), or (d) is the accurate depiction of a US nickel? The correct answeris (c).Memory ErrorsPsychologist Daniel Schacter (2001), a well-known memory researcher, offers seven ways our memories fail us.He calls them the seven sins of memory and categorizes them into three groups: forgetting, distortion, andintrusion (Table 8.1)."

Nathan\u2019s English teacher has assigned his students to read the novelTo Kill a Mockingbird. Nathan comes home from school and tells his mom he has to read this book for class.\u201cOh, I loved that book!\u201d she says. Nathan asks her what the book is about, and after some hesitation she says,\u201cWell . . . I know I read the book in high school, and I remember that one of the main characters is namedScout, and her father is an attorney, but I honestly don\u2019t remember anything else.\u201d Nathan wonders if hismother actually read the book, and his mother is surprised she can\u2019t recall the plot. What is going on here isstorage decay: unused information tends to fade with the passage of time.In 1885, German psychologist Hermann Ebbinghaus analyzed the process of memorization. First, hememorized lists of nonsense syllables. Then he measured how much he learned (retained) when he attemptedto relearn each list. He tested himself over different periods of time from 20 minutes later to 30 days later. Theresult is his famous forgetting curve (Figure 8.14). Due to storage decay, an average person will lose 50% of thememorized information after 20 minutes and 70% of the information after 24 hours (Ebbinghaus, 1885/1964).Your memory for new information decays quickly and then eventually levels out."

You probably answered yesto at least one, if not all, of these examples\u2014but don\u2019t worry, you are not alone. We are all prone to committingthe memory error known as absentmindedness, which describes lapses in memory caused by breaks inattention or our focus being somewhere else.Cynthia, a psychologist, recalls a time when she recently committed the memory error of absentmindedness.When I was completing court-ordered psychological evaluations, each time I went to the court, I wasissued a temporary identification card with a magnetic strip which would open otherwise lockeddoors. As you can imagine, in a courtroom, this identification is valuable and important and no onewanted it to be lost or be picked up by a criminal. At the end of the day, I would hand in my temporaryidentification. One day, when I was almost done with an evaluation, my daughter\u2019s day care called andsaid she was sick and needed to be picked up. It was flu season, I didn\u2019t know how sick she was, and Iwas concerned. I finished up the evaluation in the next ten minutes, packed up my briefcase, andrushed to drive to my daughter\u2019s day care. After I picked up my daughter, I could not remember if I hadhanded back my identification or if I had left it sitting out on a table. I immediately called the court tocheck. It turned out that I had handed back my identification. Why could I not remember that?(personal communication, September 5, 2013)When have you experienced absentmindedness?\u201cI just streamed this movie called Oblivion, and it had that famous actor in it. Oh, what\u2019s his name? He\u2019s beenin all of those movies, like The Shawshank Redemptionand The Dark Knighttrilogy. I think he\u2019s even won anOscar. Oh gosh, I can picture his face in my mind, and hear his distinctive voice, but I just can\u2019t think of hisname! This is going to bug me until I can remember it!\u201d This particular error can be so frustrating because youhave the information right on the tip of your tongue. Have you ever experienced this? If so, you\u2019ve committedthe error known as blocking: you can\u2019t access stored information (Figure 8.15)."

One day, they are discussing how the Hobbit booksand movies are different and Alejandra says to Lucia, \u201cI loved watching the second movie with you and seeingyou jump out of your seat during that super scary part.\u201d When Lucia responded with a puzzled and then angrylook, Alejandra realized she\u2019d committed the error of misattribution.What if someone is a victim of rape shortly after watching a television program? Is it possible that the victimcould actually blame the rape on the person she saw on television because of misattribution? This is exactlywhat happened to Donald Thomson.Australian eyewitness expert Donald Thomson appeared on a live TV discussion about theunreliability of eyewitness memory. He was later arrested, placed in a lineup and identified by a victimas the man who had raped her. The police charged Thomson although the rape had occurred at thetime he was on TV. They dismissed his alibi that he was in plain view of a TV audience and in thecompany of the other discussants, including an assistant commissioner of police. . . . Eventually, theinvestigators discovered that the rapist had attacked the woman as she was watching TV\u2014the veryprogram on which Thomson had appeared. Authorities eventually cleared Thomson. The woman hadconfused the rapist's face with the face that she had seen on TV. (Baddeley, 2004, p. 133)The second distortion error is suggestibility. Suggestibility is similar to misattribution, since it also involvesfalse memories, but it\u2019s different. With misattribution you create the false memory entirely on your own, whichis what the victim did in the Donald Thomson case above. With suggestibility, it comes from someone else,such as a therapist or police interviewer asking leading questions of a witness during an interview.Memories can also be affected by bias, which is the final distortion error. Schacter (2001) says that yourfeelings and view of the world can actually distort your memory of past events. There are several types of bias:"

For example, when Asian American and EuropeanAmerican research participants were presented with a list of names, they more frequently incorrectlyremembered typical African American names such as Jamal and Tyrone to be associated with theoccupation basketball player, and they more frequently incorrectly remembered typical White names suchas Greg and Howard to be associated with the occupation of politician (Payne, Jacoby, & Lambert, 2004).\u2022 Egocentric bias involves enhancing our memories of the past (Payne et al., 2004). Did you really score thewinning goal in that big soccer match, or did you just assist?\u2022 Hindsight bias happens when we think an outcome was inevitable after the fact. This is the \u201cI knew it allalong\u201d phenomenon. The reconstructive nature of memory contributes to hindsight bias (Carli, 1999). Weremember untrue events that seem to confirm that we knew the outcome all along.Have you ever had a song play over and over in your head? How about a memory of a traumatic event,something you really do not want to think about? When you keep remembering something, to the point whereyou can\u2019t \u201cget it out of your head\u201d and it interferes with your ability to concentrate on other things, it is calledpersistence. It\u2019s Schacter\u2019s seventh and last memory error. It\u2019s actually a failure of our memory systembecause we involuntarily recall unwanted memories, particularly unpleasant ones (Figure 8.16). For instance,you witness a horrific car accident on the way to work one morning, and you can\u2019t concentrate on workbecause you keep remembering the scene.FIGURE 8.16 Many veterans of military conflicts involuntarily recall unwanted, unpleasant memories. (credit:Department of Defense photo by U.S. Air Force Tech. Sgt. Michael R. Holzworth)InterferenceSometimes information is stored in our memory, but for some reason it is inaccessible. This is known asinterference, and there are two types: proactive interference and retroactive interference (Figure 8.17). Haveyou ever gotten a new phone number or moved to a new address, but right after you tell people the old (andwrong) phone number or address? When the new year starts, do you find you accidentally write the previousyear? These are examples of proactive interference: when old information hinders the recall of newly learnedinformation. Retroactive interference happens when information learned more recently hinders the recall ofolder information. For example, this week you are studying about memory and learn about the Ebbinghausforgetting curve. Next week you study lifespan development and learn about Erikson's theory of psychosocialdevelopment, but thereafter have trouble remembering Ebbinghaus's work because you can only rememberErickson's theory."

In this section, we\u2019ll look at some ways to help you remember better, and at some strategies formore effective studying.Memory-Enhancing StrategiesWhat are some everyday ways we can improve our memory, including recall? To help make sure informationgoes from short-term memory to long-term memory, you can use memory-enhancing strategies. Onestrategy is rehearsal, or the conscious repetition of information to be remembered (Craik & Watkins, 1973).Think about how you learned your multiplication tables as a child. You may recall that 6 x 6 = 36, 6 x 7 = 42,and 6 x 8 = 48. Memorizing these facts is rehearsal.Another strategy is chunking: you organize information into manageable bits or chunks (Bodie, Powers, &Fitch-Hauser, 2006). Chunking is useful when trying to remember information like dates and phone numbers.Instead of trying to remember 5205550467, you remember the number as 520-555-0467. So, if you met aninteresting person at a party and you wanted to remember his phone number, you would naturally chunk it,and you could repeat the number over and over, which is the rehearsal strategy.LINK TO LEARNINGTry this fun activity that employs a memory-enhancing strategy (http://openstax.org/l/memgame) to learnmore.You could also enhance memory by using elaborative rehearsal: a technique in which you think about themeaning of new information and its relation to knowledge already stored in your memory (Tigner, 1999).Elaborative rehearsal involves both linking the information to knowledge already stored and repeating theinformation. For example, in this case, you could remember that 520 is an area code for Arizona and theperson you met is from Arizona. This would help you better remember the 520 prefix. If the information is"

They areespecially useful when we want to recall larger bits of information such as steps, stages, phases, and parts of asystem (Bellezza, 1981). Brian needs to learn the order of the planets in the solar system, but he\u2019s having ahard time remembering the correct order. His friend Kelly suggests a mnemonic device that can help himremember. Kelly tells Brian to simply remember the name Mr. VEM J. SUN, and he can easily recall the correctorder of the planets: Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune. You might use amnemonic device to help you remember someone\u2019s name, a mathematical formula, or the order ofmathematical operations.FIGURE 8.18 This is a knuckle mnemonic to help you remember the number of days in each month. Months with 31days are represented by the protruding knuckles and shorter months fall in the spots between knuckles. (credit:modification of work by Cory Zanker)If you have ever watched the television show Modern Family, you might have seen Phil Dunphy explain how heremembers names:The other day I met this guy named Carl. Now, I might forget that name, but he was wearing a GratefulDead t-shirt. What\u2019s a band like the Grateful Dead? Phish. Where do fish live? The ocean. What elselives in the ocean? Coral. Hello, Co-arl. (Wrubel & Spiller, 2010)It seems the more vivid or unusual the mnemonic, the easier it is to remember. The key to using anymnemonic successfully is to find a strategy that works for you.LINK TO LEARNINGJoshua Foer is a science writer who \"accidentally\" won the U.S. Memory Championships. Watch his TEDTalk,titled \"Feats of Memory Anyone Can Do,\" in which he explains a mnemonic device called the memory palace(http://openstax.org/l/foer) to learn more.Some other strategies that are used to improve memory include expressive writing and saying words aloud.Expressive writing helps boost your short-term memory, particularly if you write about a traumatic experiencein your life. Masao Yogo and Shuji Fujihara (2008) had participants write for 20-minute intervals several timesper month. The participants were instructed to write about a traumatic experience, their best possible futureselves, or a trivial topic. The researchers found that this simple writing task increased short-term memorycapacity after five weeks, but only for the participants who wrote about traumatic experiences. Psychologists"

Simply say them out loud to yourself. Aseries of studies (MacLeod, Gopie, Hourihan, Neary, & Ozubko, 2010) found that saying a word out loudimproves your memory for the word because it increases the word\u2019s distinctiveness. Feel silly, saying randomgrocery items aloud? This technique works equally well if you just mouth the words. Using these techniquesincreased participants\u2019 memory for the words by more than 10%. These techniques can also be used to helpyou study.How to Study EffectivelyBased on the information presented in this chapter, here are some strategies and suggestions to help you honeyour study techniques (Figure 8.19). The key with any of these strategies is to figure out what works best foryou.FIGURE 8.19 Memory techniques can be useful when studying for class. (credit: Barry Pousman)\u2022 Use elaborative rehearsal: In a famous article, Fergus Craik and Robert Lockhart (1972) discussed theirbelief that information we process more deeply goes into long-term memory. Their theory is called levelsof processing. If we want to remember a piece of information, we should think about it more deeply andlink it to other information and memories to make it more meaningful. For example, if we are trying toremember that the hippocampus is involved with memory processing, we might envision a hippopotamuswith excellent memory and then we could better remember the hippocampus.\u2022 Apply the self-reference effect: As you go through the process of elaborative rehearsal, it would be evenmore beneficial to make the material you are trying to memorize personally meaningful to you. In otherwords, make use of the self-reference effect. Write notes in your own words. Write definitions from thetext, and then rewrite them in your own words. Relate the material to something you have already learnedfor another class, or think how you can apply the concepts to your own life. When you do this, you arebuilding a web of retrieval cues that will help you access the material when you want to remember it.\u2022 Use distributed practice: Study across time in short durations rather than trying to cram it all in at once.Memory consolidation takes time, and studying across time allows time for memories to consolidate. Inaddition, cramming can cause the links between concepts to become so active that you get stuck in a link,and it prevents you from accessing the rest of the information that you learned.\u2022 Rehearse, rehearse, rehearse: Review the material over time, in spaced and organized study sessions.Organize and study your notes, and take practice quizzes/exams. Link the new information to otherinformation you already know well.\u2022 Study efficiently: Students are great highlighters, but highlighting is not very efficient because studentsspend too much time studying the things they already learned. Instead of highlighting, use index cards.Write the question on one side and the answer on the other side. When you study, separate your cards into"

Eventually, allyour cards will be in the pile you answered correctly.\u2022 Be aware of interference: To reduce the likelihood of interference, study during a quiet time withoutinterruptions or distractions (like television or music).\u2022 Keep moving: Of course you already know that exercise is good for your body, but did you also know it\u2019salso good for your mind? Research suggests that regular aerobic exercise (anything that gets your heartrate elevated) is beneficial for memory (van Praag, 2008). Aerobic exercise promotes neurogenesis: thegrowth of new brain cells in the hippocampus, an area of the brain known to play a role in memory andlearning.\u2022 Get enough sleep: While you are sleeping, your brain is still at work. During sleep the brain organizes andconsolidates information to be stored in long-term memory (Abel & B\u00e4uml, 2013).\u2022 Make use of mnemonic devices: As you learned earlier in this chapter, mnemonic devices often help us toremember and recall information. There are different types of mnemonic devices, such as the acronym.An acronym is a word formed by the first letter of each of the words you want to remember. For example,even if you live near one, you might have difficulty recalling the names of all five Great Lakes. What if I toldyou to think of the word Homes? HOMES is an acronym that represents Huron, Ontario, Michigan, Erie,and Superior: the five Great Lakes. Another type of mnemonic device is an acrostic: you make a phrase ofall the first letters of the words. For example, if you are taking a math test and you are having difficultyremembering the order of operations, recalling the following sentence will help you: \u201cPlease Excuse MyDear Aunt Sally,\u201d because the order of mathematical operations is Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication,Division, Addition, Subtraction. There also are jingles, which are rhyming tunes that contain key wordsrelated to the concept, such as i before e, except after c."

        "data": "Memory is a system or process that stores what we learn for future use.Our memory has three basic functions: encoding, storing, and retrieving information. Encoding is the act ofgetting information into our memory system through automatic or effortful processing. Storage is retention ofthe information, and retrieval is the act of getting information out of storage and into conscious awarenessthrough recall, recognition, and relearning. The idea that information is processed through three memorysystems is called the Atkinson-Shiffrin model of memory. First, environmental stimuli enter our sensorymemory for a period of less than a second to a few seconds. Those stimuli that we notice and pay attention tothen move into short-term memory. According to the Atkinson-Shiffrin model, if we rehearse this information,then it moves into long-term memory for permanent storage. Other models like that of Baddeley and Hitchsuggest there is more of a feedback loop between short-term memory and long-term memory. Long-termmemory has a practically limitless storage capacity and is divided into implicit and explicit memory."

Lashley did not find the engram, but he did suggest that memories are distributedthroughout the entire brain rather than stored in one specific area. Now we know that three brain areas do playsignificant roles in the processing and storage of different types of memories: cerebellum, hippocampus, andamygdala. The cerebellum\u2019s job is to process procedural memories; the hippocampus is where new memoriesare encoded; the amygdala helps determine what memories to store, and it plays a part in determining wherethe memories are stored based on whether we have a strong or weak emotional response to the event. Strongemotional experiences can trigger the release of neurotransmitters, as well as hormones, which strengthenmemory, so that memory for an emotional event is usually stronger than memory for a non-emotional event.This is shown by what is known as the flashbulb memory phenomenon: our ability to remember significant lifeevents. However, our memory for life events (autobiographical memory) is not always accurate."

(Wordsworth, 1802)In this poem, William Wordsworth writes, \u201cthe child is father of the man.\u201d What does this seeminglyincongruous statement mean, and what does it have to do with lifespan development? Wordsworth might besuggesting that the person he is as an adult depends largely on the experiences he had in childhood. Considerthe following questions: To what extent is the adult you are today influenced by the child you once were? Towhat extent is a child fundamentally different from the adult he grows up to be?These are the types of questions developmental psychologists try to answer, by studying how humans changeand grow from conception through childhood, adolescence, adulthood, and death. They view development as alifelong process that can be studied scientifically across three developmental domains\u2014physical, cognitive,and psychosocial development. Physical development involves growth and changes in the body and brain, thesenses, motor skills, and health and wellness. Cognitive development involves learning, attention, memory,language, thinking, reasoning, and creativity. Psychosocial development involves emotions, personality, andsocial relationships. We refer to these domains throughout the chapter.CONNECT THE CONCEPTSResearch Methods in Developmental PsychologyYou\u2019ve learned about a variety of research methods used by psychologists. Developmental psychologists use manyof these approaches in order to better understand how individuals change mentally and physically over time. Thesemethods include naturalistic observations, case studies, surveys, and experiments, among others.Naturalistic observations involve observing behavior in its natural context. A developmental psychologist mightobserve how children behave on a playground, at a daycare center, or in the child\u2019s own home. While this researchapproach provides a glimpse into how children behave in their natural settings, researchers have very little controlover the types and/or frequencies of displayed behavior.In a case study, developmental psychologists collect a great deal of information from one individual in order tobetter understand physical and psychological changes over the lifespan. This particular approach is an excellent wayto better understand individuals, who are exceptional in some way, but it is especially prone to researcher bias ininterpretation, and it is difficult to generalize conclusions to the larger population.In one classic example of this research method being applied to a study of lifespan development Sigmund Freudanalyzed the development of a child known as \u201cLittle Hans\u201d (Freud, 1909/1949). Freud\u2019s findings helped inform histheories of psychosexual development in children, which you will learn about later in this chapter. Little Genie, the"

In Genie\u2019s case,her neglectful and abusive upbringing led to her being unable to speak until, at age 13, she was removed from thatharmful environment. As she learned to use language, psychologists were able to compare how her languageacquisition abilities differed when occurring in her late-stage development compared to the typical acquisition ofthose skills during the ages of infancy through early childhood (Fromkin, Krashen, Curtiss, Rigler, & Rigler, 1974;Curtiss, 1981).The survey method asks individuals to self-report important information about their thoughts, experiences, andbeliefs. This particular method can provide large amounts of information in relatively short amounts of time;however, validity of data collected in this way relies on honest self-reporting, and the data is relatively shallow whencompared to the depth of information collected in a case study. An example of comprehensive survey was theresearch done by Ruth W. Howard. In 1934, she obtained her doctorate by surveying 229 sets of triplets, the mostcomprehensive research of triplets completed at the time. This pioneering woman was also the first African-American woman to earn a PhD in psychology (American Psychological Association, 2019).Experiments involve significant control over extraneous variables and manipulation of the independent variable. Assuch, experimental research allows developmental psychologists to make causal statements about certain variablesthat are important for the developmental process. Because experimental research must occur in a controlledenvironment, researchers must be cautious about whether behaviors observed in the laboratory translate to anindividual\u2019s natural environment.Later in this chapter, you will learn about several experiments in which toddlers and young children observe scenesor actions so that researchers can determine at what age specific cognitive abilities develop. For example, childrenmay observe a quantity of liquid poured from a short, fat glass into a tall, skinny glass. As the experimentersquestion the children about what occurred, the subjects\u2019 answers help psychologists understand at what age a childbegins to comprehend that the volume of liquid remained the same although the shapes of the containers differs.Across these three domains\u2014physical, cognitive, and psychosocial\u2014the normative approach to developmentis also discussed. This approach asks, \u201cWhat is normal development?\u201d In the early decades of the 20th century,normative psychologists studied large numbers of children at various ages to determine norms (i.e., averageages) of when most children reach specific developmental milestones in each of the three domains (Gesell,1933, 1939, 1940; Gesell & Ilg, 1946; Hall, 1904). Although children develop at slightly different rates, we canuse these age-related averages as general guidelines to compare children with same-age peers to determinethe approximate ages they should reach specific normative events called developmental milestones (e.g.,crawling, walking, writing, dressing, naming colors, speaking in sentences, and starting puberty).Not all normative events are universal, meaning they are not experienced by all individuals across all cultures.Biological milestones, such as puberty, tend to be universal, but social milestones, such as the age whenchildren begin formal schooling, are not necessarily universal; instead, they affect most individuals in aparticular culture (Gesell & Ilg, 1946). For example, in developed countries children begin school around 5 or 6years old, but in developing countries, like Nigeria, children often enter school at an advanced age, if at all(Huebler, 2005; United Nations Educational, Scientific, and Cultural Organization [UNESCO], 2013).To better understand the normative approach, imagine two new mothers, Louisa and Kimberly, who are closefriends and have children around the same age. Louisa\u2019s daughter is 14 months old, and Kimberly\u2019s son is 12months old. According to the normative approach, the average age a child starts to walk is 12 months.However, at 14 months Louisa\u2019s daughter still isn\u2019t walking. She tells Kimberly she is worried that somethingmight be wrong with her baby. Kimberly is surprised because her son started walking when he was only 10months old. Should Louisa be worried? Should she be concerned if her daughter is not walking by 15 monthsor 18 months?"

After reviewing the information, take this Developmental Milestones Quiz(http://openstax.org/l/milestones) to see how well you recall what you\u2019ve learned. If you are a parent withconcerns about your child\u2019s development, contact your pediatrician.Issues in Developmental PsychologyThere are many different theoretical approaches regarding human development. As we evaluate them in thischapter, recall that developmental psychology focuses on how people change, and keep in mind that all theapproaches that we present in this chapter address questions of change: Is the change smooth or uneven(continuous versus discontinuous)? Is this pattern of change the same for everyone, or are there manydifferent patterns of change (one course of development versus many courses)? How do genetics andenvironment interact to influence development (nature versus nurture)?Is Development Continuous or Discontinuous?Continuous development views development as a cumulative process, gradually improving on existing skills(Figure 9.2). With this type of development, there is gradual change. Consider, for example, a child\u2019s physicalgrowth: adding inches to height year by year. In contrast, theorists who view development as discontinuousbelieve that development takes place in unique stages: It occurs at specific times or ages. With this type ofdevelopment, the change is more sudden, such as an infant\u2019s ability to conceive object permanence.FIGURE 9.2 The concept of continuous development can be visualized as a smooth slope of progression, whereasdiscontinuous development sees growth in more discrete stages.Is There One Course of Development or Many?Is development essentially the same, or universal, for all children (i.e., there is one course of development) ordoes development follow a different course for each child, depending on the child\u2019s specific genetics andenvironment (i.e., there are many courses of development)? Do people across the world share more similaritiesor more differences in their development? How much do culture and genetics influence a child\u2019s behavior?Stage theories hold that the sequence of development is universal. For example, in cross-cultural studies oflanguage development, children from around the world reach language milestones in a similar sequence(Gleitman & Newport, 1995). Infants in all cultures coo before they babble. They begin babbling at about thesame age and utter their first word around 12 months old. Yet we live in diverse contexts that have a uniqueeffect on each of us. For example, researchers once believed that motor development follows one course for allchildren regardless of culture. However, child care practices vary by culture, and different practices have beenfound to accelerate or inhibit achievement of developmental milestones such as sitting, crawling, and walking(Karasik, Adolph, Tamis-LeMonda, & Bornstein, 2010).For instance, let\u2019s look at the Ach\u00e9 society in Paraguay.

While foraging, Ach\u00e9 mothers carry their young children, rarely putting them down in order to protectthem from getting hurt in the forest. Consequently, their children walk much later: They walk around 23\u201325months old, in comparison to infants in Western cultures who begin to walk around 12 months old. However,as Ach\u00e9 children become older, they are allowed more freedom to move about, and by about age 9, their motorskills surpass those of U.S. children of the same age: Ach\u00e9 children are able to climb trees up to 25 feet tall anduse machetes to chop their way through the forest (Kaplan & Dove, 1987). As you can see, our development isinfluenced by multiple contexts, so the timing of basic motor functions may vary across cultures. However, thefunctions themselves are present in all societies (Figure 9.3).FIGURE 9.3 All children across the world love to play. Whether in (a) Florida or (b) South Africa, children enjoyexploring sand, sunshine, and the sea.

This longstanding question is known in psychology as the nature versus nurturedebate. It seeks to understand how our personalities and traits are the product of our genetic makeup andbiological factors, and how they are shaped by our environment, including our guardians, peers, and culture.For instance, why do biological children sometimes act like their parents\u2014is it because of genetics or becauseof early childhood environment and what the child has learned from the parents? What about children who areadopted\u2014are they more like their biological families or more like their adoptive families? And how can siblingsfrom the same family be so different?We are all born with specific genetic traits inherited from our parents, such as eye color, height, and certainpersonality traits. Beyond our basic genotype, however, there is a deep interaction between our genes and ourenvironment: Our unique experiences in our environment influence whether and how particular traits areexpressed, and at the same time, our genes influence how we interact with our environment (Diamond, 2009;Lobo, 2008). This chapter will show that there is a reciprocal interaction between nature and nurture as theyboth shape who we become, but the debate continues as to the relative contributions of each.DIG DEEPERThe Achievement Gap: How Does Socioeconomic Status Affect Development?The achievement gap refers to the persistent difference in grades, test scores, and graduation rates that existamong students of different ethnicities, races, and\u2014in certain subjects\u2014genders (Winerman, 2011). Researchsuggests that these achievement gaps are strongly influenced by differences in socioeconomic factors that existamong the families of these children. While the researchers acknowledge that programs aimed at reducing suchsocioeconomic discrepancies would likely aid in equalizing the aptitude and performance of children fromdifferent backgrounds, they recognize that such large-scale interventions would be difficult to achieve. Therefore,it is recommended that programs aimed at fostering aptitude and achievement among disadvantaged childrenmay be the best option for dealing with issues related to academic achievement gaps (Duncan & Magnuson,"

There have been attempts tocorrect the achievement gap through state and federal legislation, but what if the problems start before thechildren even enter school?Psychologists Betty Hart and Todd Risley (2006) spent their careers looking at early language ability andprogression of children in various income levels. In one longitudinal study, they found that although all theparents in the study engaged and interacted with their children, middle- and high-income parents interacted withtheir children differently than low-income parents. After analyzing 1,300 hours of parent-child interactions, theresearchers found that middle- and high-income parents talk to their children significantly more, starting whenthe children are infants. By 3 years old, high-income children knew almost double the number of words known bytheir low-income counterparts, and they had heard an estimated total of 30 million more words than the low-income counterparts (Hart & Risley, 2003). And the gaps only become more pronounced. Before enteringkindergarten, high-income children score 60% higher on achievement tests than their low-income peers (Lee &Burkam, 2002).There are solutions to this problem. At the University of Chicago, experts are working with low-income families,visiting them at their homes, and encouraging them to speak more to their children on a daily and hourly basis.Other experts are designing preschools in which students from diverse economic backgrounds are placed in thesame classroom. In this research, low-income children made significant gains in their language development,likely as a result of attending the specialized preschool (Schechter & Byeb, 2007). What other methods orinterventions could be used to decrease the achievement gap? What types of activities could be implemented tohelp the children of your community or a neighboring community?"

Weexplore several of these theories in this section.Psychosexual Theory of DevelopmentSigmund Freud (1856\u20131939) believed that personality develops during early childhood. For Freud, childhoodexperiences shape our personalities and behavior as adults. Freud viewed development as discontinuous; hebelieved that each of us must pass through a series of stages during childhood, and that if we lack propernurturance and parenting during a stage, we may become stuck, or fixated, in that stage. Freud\u2019s stages arecalled the stages of psychosexual development. According to Freud, children\u2019s pleasure-seeking urges arefocused on a different area of the body, called an erogenous zone, at each of the five stages of development:oral, anal, phallic, latency, and genital.While most of Freud\u2019s ideas have not found support in modern research, we cannot discount the contributionsthat Freud has made to the field of psychology. Psychologists today dispute Freud's psychosexual stages as alegitimate explanation for how one's personality develops, but what we can take away from Freud\u2019s theory is"

These stages are discussed indetail in the chapter on personality.Psychosocial Theory of DevelopmentErik Erikson (1902\u20131994) (Figure 9.4), another stage theorist, took Freud\u2019s theory and modified it aspsychosocial theory. Erikson\u2019s psychosocial development theory emphasizes the social nature of ourdevelopment rather than its sexual nature. While Freud believed that personality is shaped only in childhood,Erikson proposed that personality development takes place all through the lifespan. Erikson suggested thathow we interact with others is what affects our sense of self, or what he called the ego identity.FIGURE 9.4 Erik Erikson proposed the psychosocial theory of development. In each stage of Erikson\u2019s theory, thereis a psychosocial task that we must master in order to feel a sense of competence.Erikson proposed that we are motivated by a need to achieve competence in certain areas of our lives.According to psychosocial theory, we experience eight stages of development over our lifespan, from infancythrough late adulthood. At each stage there is a conflict, or task, that we need to resolve. Successful completionof each developmental task results in a sense of competence and a healthy personality. Failure to master thesetasks leads to feelings of inadequacy.According to Erikson (1963), trust is the basis of our development during infancy (birth to 12 months).Therefore, the primary task of this stage is trust versus mistrust. Infants are dependent upon their caregivers,so caregivers who are responsive and sensitive to their infant\u2019s needs help their baby to develop a sense oftrust; their baby will see the world as a safe, predictable place. Unresponsive caregivers who do not meet theirbaby\u2019s needs can engender feelings of anxiety, fear, and mistrust; their baby may see the world asunpredictable.As toddlers (ages 1\u20133 years) begin to explore their world, they learn that they can control their actions and acton the environment to get results. They begin to show clear preferences for certain elements of theenvironment, such as food, toys, and clothing. A toddler\u2019s main task is to resolve the issue of autonomy versusshame and doubt, by working to establish independence. This is the \u201cme do it\u201d stage. For example, we mightobserve a budding sense of autonomy in a 2-year-old child who wants to choose her clothes and dress herself.Although her outfits might not be appropriate for the situation, her input in such basic decisions has an effecton her sense of independence. If denied the opportunity to act on her environment, she may begin to doubt herabilities, which could lead to low self-esteem and feelings of shame.Once children reach the preschool stage (ages 3\u20136 years), they are capable of initiating activities and assertingcontrol over their world through social interactions and play. According to Erikson, preschool children mustresolve the task of initiative versus guilt. By learning to plan and achieve goals while interacting with others,preschool children can master this task. Those who do will develop self-confidence and feel a sense of purpose.Those who are unsuccessful at this stage\u2014with their initiative misfiring or stifled\u2014may develop feelings ofguilt. How might over-controlling parents stifle a child\u2019s initiative?"

Childrenbegin to compare themselves to their peers to see how they measure up. They either develop a sense of prideand accomplishment in their schoolwork, sports, social activities, and family life, or they feel inferior andinadequate when they don\u2019t measure up. What are some things parents and teachers can do to help childrendevelop a sense of competence and a belief in themselves and their abilities?In adolescence (ages 12\u201318), children face the task of identity versus role confusion. According to Erikson, anadolescent\u2019s main task is developing a sense of self. Adolescents struggle with questions such as \u201cWho am I?\u201dand \u201cWhat do I want to do with my life?\u201d Along the way, most adolescents try on many different selves to seewhich ones fit. Adolescents who are successful at this stage have a strong sense of identity and are able toremain true to their beliefs and values in the face of problems and other people\u2019s perspectives. What happensto apathetic adolescents, who do not make a conscious search for identity, or those who are pressured toconform to their parents\u2019 ideas for the future? These teens will have a weak sense of self and experience roleconfusion. They are unsure of their identity and confused about the future.People in early adulthood (i.e., 20s through early 40s) are concerned with intimacy versus isolation. After wehave developed a sense of self in adolescence, we are ready to share our life with others. Erikson said that wemust have a strong sense of self before developing intimate relationships with others. Adults who do notdevelop a positive self-concept in adolescence may experience feelings of loneliness and emotional isolation.When people reach their 40s, they enter the time known as middle adulthood, which extends to the mid-60s.The social task of middle adulthood is generativity versus stagnation. Generativity involves finding your life\u2019swork and contributing to the development of others, through activities such as volunteering, mentoring, andraising children. Those who do not master this task may experience stagnation, having little connection withothers and little interest in productivity and self-improvement.From the mid-60s to the end of life, we are in the period of development known as late adulthood. Erikson\u2019stask at this stage is called integrity versus despair. He said that people in late adulthood reflect on their livesand feel either a sense of satisfaction or a sense of failure. People who feel proud of their accomplishments feela sense of integrity, and they can look back on their lives with few regrets. However, people who are notsuccessful at this stage may feel as if their life has been wasted. They focus on what \u201cwould have,\u201d \u201cshouldhave,\u201d and \u201ccould have\u201d been.

Instead ofapproaching development from a psychoanalytical or psychosocial perspective, Piaget focused on children\u2019scognitive growth. He believed that thinking is a central aspect of development and that children are naturallyinquisitive. However, he said that children do not think and reason like adults (Piaget, 1930, 1932). His theoryof cognitive development holds that our cognitive abilities develop through specific stages, which exemplifiesthe discontinuity approach to development. As we progress to a new stage, there is a distinct shift in how wethink and reason.FIGURE 9.5 Jean Piaget spent over 50 years studying children and how their minds develop.Piaget said that children develop schemata to help them understand the world. Schemata are concepts(mental models) that are used to help us categorize and interpret information. By the time children havereached adulthood, they have created schemata for almost everything. When children learn new information,they adjust their schemata through two processes: assimilation and accommodation. First, they assimilate newinformation or experiences in terms of their current schemata: assimilation is when they take in informationthat is comparable to what they already know. Accommodation describes when they change their schematabased on new information. This process continues as children interact with their environment.For example, 2-year-old Abdul learned the schema for dogs because his family has a Labrador retriever. WhenAbdul sees other dogs in his picture books, he says, \u201cLook mommy, dog!\u201d Thus, he has assimilated them into"

One day, Abdul sees a sheep for the first time and says, \u201cLook mommy, dog!\u201d Having abasic schema that a dog is an animal with four legs and fur, Abdul thinks all furry, four-legged creatures aredogs. When Abdul\u2019s mom tells him that the animal he sees is a sheep, not a dog, Abdul must accommodate hisschema for dogs to include more information based on his new experiences. Abdul\u2019s schema for dog was toobroad, since not all furry, four-legged creatures are dogs. He now modifies his schema for dogs and forms anew one for sheep.Like Freud and Erikson, Piaget thought development unfolds in a series of stages approximately associatedwith age ranges. He proposed a theory of cognitive development that unfolds in four stages: sensorimotor,preoperational, concrete operational, and formal operational (Table 9.2).Piaget\u2019s Stages of Cognitive DevelopmentAge(years)StageDescription0\u20132Sensorimotor World experienced through senses and actions2\u20136PreoperationalUse words and images to represent things, but lack logicalreasoningConcreteoperationalUnderstand concrete events and analogies logically; performarithmetical operationsFormaloperationalFormal operationsUtilize abstract reasoning7\u20131112\u2013TABLE 9.2DevelopmentalissuesObject permanenceStranger anxietyPretend playEgocentrismLanguagedevelopmentConservationMathematicaltransformationsAbstract logicMoral reasoningThe first stage is the sensorimotor stage, which lasts from birth to about 2 years old. During this stage,children learn about the world through their senses and motor behavior. Young children put objects in theirmouths to see if the items are edible, and once they can grasp objects, they may shake or bang them to see ifthey make sounds. Between 5 and 8 months old, the child develops object permanence, which is theunderstanding that even if something is out of sight, it still exists (Bogartz, Shinskey, & Schilling, 2000).According to Piaget, young infants do not remember an object after it has been removed from sight. Piagetstudied infants\u2019 reactions when a toy was first shown to an infant and then hidden under a blanket. Infantswho had already developed object permanence would reach for the hidden toy, indicating that they knew it stillexisted, whereas infants who had not developed object permanence would appear confused.LINK TO LEARNINGPlease take a few minutes and view this brief video demonstrating different children's abilities to understandobject permanence (http://openstax.org/l/piaget) to learn more.In Piaget\u2019s view, around the same time children develop object permanence, they also begin to exhibit strangeranxiety, which is a fear of unfamiliar people. Babies may demonstrate this by crying and turning away from astranger, by clinging to a caregiver, or by attempting to reach their arms toward familiar faces such as parents.Stranger anxiety results when a child is unable to assimilate the stranger into an existing schema; therefore,"

In this stage,children can use symbols to represent words, images, and ideas, which is why children in this stage engage inpretend play. A child\u2019s arms might become airplane wings as they zoom around the room, or a child with astick might become a brave knight with a sword. Children also begin to use language in the preoperationalstage, but they cannot understand adult logic or mentally manipulate information (the term operationalrefersto logical manipulation of information, so children at this stage are considered to be pre-operational).Children\u2019s logic is based on their own personal knowledge of the world so far, rather than on conventionalknowledge. For example, dad gave a slice of pizza to 10-year-old Keiko and another slice to her 3-year-oldbrother, Kenny. Kenny\u2019s pizza slice was cut into five pieces, so Kenny told his sister that he got more pizza thanshe did. Children in this stage cannot perform mental operations because they have not developed anunderstanding of conservation, which is the idea that even if you change the appearance of something, it isstill equal in size as long as nothing has been removed or added.LINK TO LEARNINGWatch this video of a boy in the preoperational stage responding to Piaget's conservation tasks(http://openstax.org/l/piaget2) to learn more.During this stage, we also expect children to display egocentrism, which means that the child is not able totake the perspective of others. A child at this stage thinks that everyone sees, thinks, and feels just as they do.Let\u2019s look at Kenny and Keiko again. Keiko\u2019s birthday is coming up, so their mom takes Kenny to the toy store tochoose a present for his sister. He selects an Iron Man action figure for her, thinking that if he likes the toy, hissister will too. An egocentric child is not able to infer the perspective of other people and instead attributes hisown perspective.LINK TO LEARNINGPiaget developed the Three-Mountain Task to determine the level of egocentrism displayed by children.Children view a 3-dimensional mountain scene from one viewpoint, and are asked what another person at adifferent viewpoint would see in the same scene. Watch this short video of the Three Mountain Task in action(http://openstax.org/l/WonderYears) from the University of Minnesota and the Science Museum of Minnesota.Piaget\u2019s third stage is the concrete operational stage, which occurs from about 7 to 11 years old. In this stage,children can think logically about real (concrete) events; they have a firm grasp on the use of numbers andstart to employ memory strategies. They can perform mathematical operations and understandtransformations, such as addition is the opposite of subtraction, and multiplication is the opposite of division.In this stage, children also master the concept of conservation: Even if something changes shape, its mass,volume, and number stay the same. For example, if you pour water from a tall, thin glass to a short, fat glass,you still have the same amount of water. Remember Keiko and Kenny and the pizza? How did Keiko know thatKenny was wrong when he said that he had more pizza?Children in the concrete operational stage also understand the principle of reversibility, which means thatobjects can be changed and then returned back to their original form or condition. Take, for example, waterthat you poured into the short, fat glass: You can pour water from the fat glass back to the thin glass and stillhave the same amount (minus a couple of drops).The fourth, and last, stage in Piaget\u2019s theory is the formal operational stage, which is from about age 11 toadulthood. Whereas children in the concrete operational stage are able to think logically only about concreteevents, children in the formal operational stage can also deal with abstract ideas and hypothetical situations.Children in this stage can use abstract thinking to problem solve, look at alternative solutions, and test these"

For example, a 15-year-old with a very small pimpleon her face might think it is huge and incredibly visible, under the mistaken impression that others must shareher perceptions.Beyond Formal Operational ThoughtAs with other major contributors of theories of development, several of Piaget\u2019s ideas have come undercriticism based on the results of further research. For example, several contemporary studies support a modelof development that is more continuous than Piaget\u2019s discrete stages (Courage & Howe, 2002; Siegler, 2005,2006). Many others suggest that children reach cognitive milestones earlier than Piaget describes (Baillargeon,2004; de Hevia & Spelke, 2010).According to Piaget, the highest level of cognitive development is formal operational thought, which developsbetween 11 and 20 years old. However, many developmental psychologists disagree with Piaget, suggesting afifth stage of cognitive development, known as the postformal stage (Basseches, 1984; Commons & Bresette,2006; Sinnott, 1998). In postformal thinking, decisions are made based on situations and circumstances, andlogic is integrated with emotion as adults develop principles that depend on contexts. One way that we can seethe difference between an adult in postformal thought and an adolescent in formal operations is in terms ofhow they handle emotionally charged issues.It seems that once we reach adulthood our problem solving abilities change: As we attempt to solve problems,we tend to think more deeply about many areas of our lives, such as relationships, work, and politics(Labouvie-Vief & Diehl, 1999). Because of this, postformal thinkers are able to draw on past experiences to helpthem solve new problems. Problem-solving strategies using postformal thought vary, depending on thesituation. What does this mean? Adults can recognize, for example, that what seems to be an ideal solution to aproblem at work involving a disagreement with a colleague may not be the best solution to a disagreement witha significant other.CONNECT THE CONCEPTSNeuroconstructivismThe genetic environmental correlation you\u2019ve learned about concerning the bidirectional influence of genes and theenvironment has been explored in more recent theories (Newcombe, 2011). One such theory, neuroconstructivism,suggests that neural brain development influences cognitive development. Experiences that a child encounters canimpact or change the way that neural pathways develop in response to the environment. An individual\u2019s behavior isbased on how one understands the world. There is interaction between neural and cognitive networks at andbetween each level, consisting of these:\u2022 genes\u2022 neurons\u2022 brain\u2022 body\u2022 social environmentThese interactions shape mental representations in the brain and are dependent on context that individuals activelyexplore throughout their lifetimes (Westermann, Mareschal, Johnson, Sirois, Spratling, & Thomas, 2007).An example of this would be a child who may be genetically predisposed to a difficult temperament. They may haveparents who provide a social environment in which they are encouraged to express themselves in an optimalmanner. The child's brain would form neural connections enhanced by that environment, thus influencing the brain.The brain gives information to the body about how it will experience the environment. Thus, neural and cognitivenetworks work together to influence genes (i.e., attenuating temperament), body (i.e., may be less prone to highblood pressure), and social environment (i.e., may seek people who are similar to them)."

He suggestedthat human development is rooted in one\u2019s culture. A child\u2019s social world, for example, forms the basis for theformation of language and thought. The language one speaks and the ways a person thinks about things isdependent on one\u2019s cultural background. Vygotsky also considered historical influences as key to one\u2019sdevelopment. He was interested in the process of development and the individual\u2019s interactions with theirenvironment (John-Steiner & Mahn, 1996).Moral Theory Of DevelopmentA major task beginning in childhood and continuing into adolescence is discerning right from wrong.Psychologist Lawrence Kohlberg (1927\u20131987) extended upon the foundation that Piaget built regardingcognitive development. Kohlberg believed that moral development, like cognitive development, follows aseries of stages. To develop this theory, Kohlberg posed moral dilemmas to people of all ages, and then heanalyzed their answers to find evidence of their particular stage of moral development. Before reading aboutthe stages, take a minute to consider how you would answer one of Kohlberg's best-known moral dilemmas,commonly known as the Heinz dilemma:In Europe, a woman was near death from a special kind of cancer. There was one drug that the doctorsthought might save her. It was a form of radium that a druggist in the same town had recentlydiscovered. The drug was expensive to make, but the druggist was charging ten times what the drugcost him to make. He paid $200 for the radium and charged $2,000 for a small dose of the drug. Thesick woman's husband, Heinz, went to everyone he knew to borrow the money, but he could only gettogether about $1,000, which is half of what it cost. He told the druggist that his wife was dying andasked him to sell it cheaper or let him pay later. But the druggist said: \u201cNo, I discovered the drug andI'm going to make money from it.\u201d So Heinz got desperate and broke into the man's store to steal thedrug for his wife. Should the husband have done that? (Kohlberg, 1969, p. 379)How would you answer this dilemma? Kohlberg was not interested in whether you answer yes or no to thedilemma: Instead, he was interested in the reasoning behind your answer.After presenting people with this and various other moral dilemmas, Kohlberg reviewed people\u2019s responsesand placed them in different stages of moral reasoning (Figure 9.6). According to Kohlberg, an individualprogresses from the capacity for pre-conventional morality (before age 9) to the capacity for conventionalmorality (early adolescence), and toward attaining post-conventional morality (once formal operationalthought is attained), which only a few fully achieve. Kohlberg placed in the highest stage responses thatreflected the reasoning that Heinz should steal the drug because his wife\u2019s life is more important than thepharmacist making money. The value of a human life overrides the pharmacist\u2019s greed."

Many psychologistsagree with Kohlberg's theory of moral development but point out that moral reasoning is very different frommoral behavior. Sometimes what we say we would do in a situation is not what we actually do in that situation.In other words, we might \u201ctalk the talk,\u201d but not \u201cwalk the walk.\u201dHow does this theory apply to people of different genders? Kohlberg (1969) felt that more men than womenmove past stage four in their moral development. He went on to note that women seem to be deficient in theirmoral reasoning abilities. These ideas were not well received by Carol Gilligan, a research assistant ofKohlberg, who consequently developed her own ideas of moral development. In her groundbreaking book, In aDifferent Voice: Psychological Theory and Women\u2019s Development, Gilligan (1982) criticized her formermentor\u2019s theory because it was based only on upper class White men and boys. She argued that women are notdeficient in their moral reasoning\u2014she proposed that different genders reason differently. Girls and womenfocus more on staying connected and the importance of interpersonal relationships. Therefore, in the Heinzdilemma, many girls and women respond that Heinz should not steal the medicine. Their reasoning is that ifhe steals the medicine, is arrested, and is put in jail, then he and his wife will be separated, and she could diewhile he is still in prison."

Mirroring Erikson\u2019sstages, lifespan development is divided into different stages that are based on age. We will discuss prenatal,infant, child, adolescent, and adult development.Prenatal DevelopmentHow did you come to be who you are? From beginning as a one-cell structure to your birth, your prenataldevelopment occurred in an orderly and delicate sequence.There are three stages of prenatal development: germinal, embryonic, and fetal. Let\u2019s take a look at whathappens to the developing baby in each of these stages.Germinal Stage (Weeks 1\u20132)In the discussion of biopsychology earlier in the book, you learned about genetics and DNA. DNA is passed onto the child at the moment of conception. Conception occurs when sperm fertilizes an egg and forms a zygote(Figure 9.7). A zygote begins as a one-cell structure that is created when a sperm and egg merge. The geneticmakeup and sex of the zygote are set at this point. During the first week after conception, the zygote dividesand multiplies, going from a one-cell structure to two cells, then four cells, then eight cells, and so on. Thisprocess of cell division is called mitosis. Mitosis is a fragile process, and fewer than one-half of all zygotessurvive beyond the first two weeks (Hall, 2004). After 5 days of mitosis there are 100 cells, and after 9 monthsthere are billions of cells. As the cells divide, they become more specialized, forming different organs and bodyparts. In the germinal stage, the mass of cells has yet to attach itself to the lining of the mother\u2019s uterus. Once itdoes, the next stage begins.FIGURE 9.7 Sperm and ovum fuse at the point of conception.Embryonic Stage (Weeks 3\u20138)After the zygote divides for about 7\u201310 days and has 150 cells, it travels down the fallopian tubes and implantsitself in the lining of the uterus. Upon implantation, this multi-cellular organism is called an embryo. Nowblood vessels grow, forming the placenta. The placenta is a structure connected to the uterus that providesnourishment and oxygen from the mother to the developing embryo via the umbilical cord. Basic structures ofthe embryo start to develop into areas that will become the head, chest, and abdomen. During the embryonicstage, the heart begins to beat and organs form and begin to function. The neural tube forms along the back ofthe embryo, developing into the spinal cord and brain.Fetal Stage (Weeks 9\u201340)When the organism is about nine weeks old, the embryo is called a fetus. At this stage, the fetus is about thesize of a kidney bean and begins to take on the recognizable form of a human being as the \u201ctail\u201d begins todisappear.From 9\u201312 weeks, the sex organs begin to differentiate. At about 16 weeks, the fetus is approximately 4.5inches long. Fingers and toes are fully developed, and fingerprints are visible. By the time the fetus reaches thesixth month of development (24 weeks), it weighs up to 1.4 pounds. Hearing has developed, so the fetus canrespond to sounds. The internal organs, such as the lungs, heart, stomach, and intestines, have formed enoughthat a fetus born prematurely at this point has a chance to survive outside of the mother\u2019s womb. Throughoutthe fetal stage the brain continues to grow and develop, nearly doubling in size from weeks 16 to 28. Around 36"

It weighs about 6 pounds and is about 18.5 inches long, and by week37 all of the fetus\u2019s organ systems are developed enough that it could survive outside the uterus without manyof the risks associated with premature birth. The fetus continues to gain weight and grow in length untilapproximately 40 weeks. By then, the fetus has very little room to move around and birth becomes imminent.The progression through the stages is shown in Figure 9.8.FIGURE 9.8 During the fetal stage, the baby's brain develops and the body adds size and weight, until the fetusreaches full-term development.LINK TO LEARNINGFor an amazing look at prenatal development and the process of birth, view the video Life\u2019s Greatest Miracle(http://openstax.org/l/miracle) from Nova and PBS.Prenatal InfluencesDuring each prenatal stage, genetic and environmental factors can affect development. The developing fetus iscompletely dependent on the mother for life. It is important that the mother takes good care of herself andreceives prenatal care, which is medical care during pregnancy that monitors the health of both the motherand the fetus (Figure 9.9). According to the National Institutes of Health ([NIH], 2013), routine prenatal care isimportant because it can reduce the risk of complications to the mother and fetus during pregnancy. In fact,women who are trying to become pregnant or who may become pregnant should discuss pregnancy planningwith their doctor. They may be advised, for example, to take a vitamin containing folic acid, which helpsprevent certain birth defects, or to monitor aspects of their diet or exercise routines."

(credit: \"MIKIYoshihito_Flickr\"/Flickr)Recall that when the zygote attaches to the wall of the mother\u2019s uterus, the placenta is formed. The placentaprovides nourishment and oxygen to the fetus. Most everything the mother ingests, including food, liquid, andeven medication, travels through the placenta to the fetus, hence the common phrase \u201ceating for two.\u201dAnything the mother is exposed to in the environment affects the fetus; if the mother is exposed to somethingharmful, the child can show life-long effects.A teratogen is any environmental agent\u2014biological, chemical, or physical\u2014that causes damage to thedeveloping embryo or fetus. There are different types of teratogens. Alcohol and most drugs cross the placentaand affect the fetus. Alcohol is not safe to drink in any amount during pregnancy. Alcohol use duringpregnancy has been found to be the leading preventable cause of intellectual disabilities in children in theUnited States (Maier & West, 2001). Excessive maternal drinking while pregnant can cause fetal alcoholspectrum disorders with life-long consequences for the child ranging in severity from minor to major (Table9.3). Fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD) are a collection of birth defects associated with heavyconsumption of alcohol during pregnancy. Physically, children with FASD may have a small head size andabnormal facial features. Cognitively, these children may have poor judgment, poor impulse control, higherrates of ADHD, learning issues, and lower IQ scores. These developmental problems and delays persist intoadulthood (Streissguth et al., 2004). Based on studies conducted on animals, it also has been suggested that aparent's alcohol consumption during pregnancy may predispose their child to like alcohol (Youngentob et al.,2007).Fetal Alcohol Syndrome Facial FeaturesFacial FeaturePotential Effect of Fetal Alcohol SyndromeHead sizeBelow-average head circumferenceEyesNoseSmaller than average eye opening, skin folds at corners of eyesLow nasal bridge, short noseMidfaceSmaller than average midface sizeLip and philtrum Thin upper lip, indistinct philtrumTABLE 9.3Smoking is also considered a teratogen because nicotine travels through the placenta to the fetus.

According to the Centersfor Disease Control and Prevention (2013), smoking while pregnant can result in premature birth, low-birth-weight infants, stillbirth, and sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS).Heroin, cocaine, methamphetamine, almost all prescription medicines, and most over-the countermedications are also considered teratogens. Babies born with a heroin addiction need heroin just like an adultaddict. The child will need to be gradually weaned from the heroin under medical supervision; otherwise, thechild could have seizures and die. Other teratogens include radiation, viruses such as HIV and herpes, andrubella (German measles). Women in the United States are much less likely to be afflicted with rubella becausemost women received childhood immunizations or vaccinations that protect the body from disease.Each organ of the fetus develops during a specific period in the pregnancy, called the critical or sensitiveperiod (Figure 9.8). For example, research with primate models of FASD has demonstrated that the timeduring which a developing fetus is exposed to alcohol can dramatically affect the appearance of facialcharacteristics associated with fetal alcohol syndrome. Specifically, this research suggests that alcoholexposure that is limited to day 19 or 20 of gestation can lead to significant facial abnormalities in the offspring(Ashley, Magnuson, Omnell, & Clarren, 1999). Given regions of the brain also show sensitive periods duringwhich they are most susceptible to the teratogenic effects of alcohol (Tran & Kelly, 2003).WHAT DO YOU THINK?Should People Who Use Drugs During Pregnancy Be Arrested and Jailed?As you now know, people who use drugs or alcohol during pregnancy can cause serious lifelong harm to theirchild. Some have advocated mandatory screenings for pregnant people and have a history of problematic druguse, and if they continue using, to arrest, prosecute, and incarcerate them (Figdor & Kaeser, 1998). This policywas tried in Charleston, South Carolina, as recently as 20 years ago. The policy was called the Interagency Policyon Management of Substance Abuse During Pregnancy, and had disastrous results.The Interagency Policy applied to patients attending the obstetrics clinic at MUSC, which primarilyserves patients who are indigent or on Medicaid. It did not apply to private obstetrical patients. Thepolicy required patient education about the harmful effects of substance abuse during pregnancy. . . .[A] statement also warned patients that protection of unborn and newborn children from the harms ofillegal drug abuse could involve the Charleston police, the Solicitor of the Ninth Judicial Court, and theProtective Services Division of the Department of Social Services (DSS). (Jos, Marshall, & Perlmutter,1995, pp. 120\u2013121)This policy seemed to deter pregnant people from seeking prenatal care, deterred them from seeking othersocial services, and was applied solely to people with low incomes, resulting in lawsuits. The program wascanceled after 5 years, during which 42 women were arrested. A federal agency later determined that theprogram involved human experimentation without the approval and oversight of an institutional review board(IRB). What were the flaws in the program and how would you correct them? What are the ethical implications ofcharging pregnant people with child abuse?Infancy Through ChildhoodThe average newborn weighs approximately 7.5 pounds. Although small, newborns are not completelyhelpless because their reflexes and sensory capacities help them interact with the environment from themoment of birth. All healthy babies are born with newborn reflexes: inborn automatic responses to particularforms of stimulation. Reflexes help the newborn survive until it is capable of more complex behaviors\u2014thesereflexes are crucial to survival. They are present in babies whose brains are developing normally and usuallydisappear around 4\u20135 months old. Let\u2019s take a look at some of these newborn reflexes. The rooting reflex is the"

The sucking reflex is the automatic, unlearned, suckingmotions that infants do with their mouths. Several other interesting newborn reflexes can be observed. Forinstance, if you put your finger into a newborn\u2019s hand, you will witness the grasping reflex, in which a babyautomatically grasps anything that touches the palms. The Moro reflex is the newborn\u2019s response to thesensation of falling. The baby spreads the arms, pulls them back in, and then (usually) cries. How do you thinkthese reflexes promote survival in the first months of life?LINK TO LEARNINGTake a few minutes to view this brief video clip about newborn reflexes (http://openstax.org/l/newflexes) tolearn more.What can young infants see, hear, and smell? Newborn infants\u2019 sensory abilities are significant, but theirsenses are not yet fully developed. Many of a newborn\u2019s innate preferences facilitate interaction withcaregivers and other humans. Although vision is their least developed sense, newborns already show apreference for faces. Babies who are just a few days old also prefer human voices, they will listen to voiceslonger than sounds that do not involve speech (Vouloumanos & Werker, 2004), and they seem to prefer theirmother\u2019s voice over a stranger\u2019s voice (Mills & Melhuish, 1974). In an interesting experiment, 3-week-oldbabies were given pacifiers that played a recording of the infant\u2019s mother\u2019s voice and of a stranger\u2019s voice.When the infants heard their mother\u2019s voice, they sucked more strongly at the pacifier (Mills & Melhuish,1974). Newborns also have a strong sense of smell. For instance, newborn babies can distinguish the smell oftheir own mother from that of others. In a study by MacFarlane (1978), 1-week-old babies who were beingbreastfed were placed between two gauze pads. One gauze pad was from the bra of a nursing mother who was astranger, and the other gauze pad was from the bra of the infant\u2019s own mother. More than two-thirds of theweek-old babies turned toward the gauze pad with their mother\u2019s scent.Physical DevelopmentIn infancy, toddlerhood, and early childhood, the body\u2019s physical development is rapid (Figure 9.10). Onaverage, newborns weigh between 5 and 10 pounds, and a newborn\u2019s weight typically doubles in six monthsand triples in one year. By 2 years old the weight will have quadrupled, so we can expect that a 2 year oldshould weigh between 20 and 40 pounds. The average length of a newborn is 19.5 inches, increasing to 29.5inches by 12 months and 34.4 inches by 2 years old (WHO Multicentre Growth Reference Study Group, 2006).FIGURE 9.10 Children experience rapid physical changes through infancy and early childhood.

Growth slows between 4 and 6 years old: During this time children gain 5\u20137 pounds and grow about 2\u20133inches per year.

By 10 years old, the average female weighs 88 pounds, and the average male weighs 85 pounds.It was previously believed that we are born with all of the brain cells we will ever have. More recent researchsuggests that neurogenesis (the formation of neurons) can continue through adulthood. However, the vastmajority of neural connections and pathways occur during the first few years of a child\u2019s life (National Instituteof Neurological Disorders and Stroke, 2019). This period of rapid neural growth is called blooming. Neuralpathways continue to develop through puberty. The blooming period of neural growth is then followed by aperiod of pruning, where neural connections are reduced. It is thought that pruning causes the brain tofunction more efficiently, allowing for mastery of more complex skills (Hutchinson, 2011). Blooming occursduring the first few years of life, and pruning continues through childhood and into adolescence in variousareas of the brain.The size of our brains increases rapidly. For example, the brain of a 2-year-old is 55% of its adult size, and by 6years old the brain is about 90% of its adult size (Tanner, 1978). During early childhood (ages 3\u20136), the frontallobes grow rapidly. Recalling our discussion of the 4 lobes of the brain earlier in this book, the frontal lobes areassociated with planning, reasoning, memory, and impulse control. Therefore, by the time children reachschool age, they are developmentally capable of controlling their attention and behavior. Through theelementary school years, the frontal, temporal, occipital, and parietal lobes all grow in size. The brain growthspurts experienced in childhood tend to follow Piaget\u2019s sequence of cognitive development, so that significantchanges in neural functioning account for cognitive advances (Kolb & Whishaw, 2009; Overman, Bachevalier,Turner, & Peuster, 1992).Motor development occurs in an orderly sequence as infants move from reflexive reactions (e.g., sucking androoting) to more advanced motor functioning. For instance, babies first learn to hold their heads up, then to sitwith assistance, and then to sit unassisted, followed later by crawling and then walking.Motor skills refer to our ability to move our bodies and manipulate objects. Fine motor skills focus on themuscles in our fingers, toes, and eyes, and enable coordination of small actions (e.g., grasping a toy, writingwith a pencil, and using a spoon). Gross motor skills focus on large muscle groups that control our arms andlegs and involve larger movements (e.g., balancing, running, and jumping).As motor skills develop, there are certain developmental milestones that young children should achieve (Table9.4). For each milestone there is an average age, as well as a range of ages in which the milestone should bereached. An example of a developmental milestone is sitting. On average, most babies sit alone at 7 monthsold. Sitting involves both coordination and muscle strength, and 90% of babies achieve this milestone between5 and 9 months old. In another example, babies on average are able to hold up their head at 6 weeks old, and90% of babies achieve this between 3 weeks and 4 months old. If a baby is not holding up their head by 4months old, they are showing a delay. If the child is displaying delays on several milestones, that is reason forconcern, and the parent or caregiver should discuss this with the child\u2019s pediatrician. Some developmentaldelays can be identified and addressed through early intervention.Developmental Milestones, Ages 2\u20135 YearsAge(years)2PhysicalPersonal/SocialLanguageCognitiveKicks a ball;walks up anddown stairsPlays alongside otherchildren; copies adultsPoints to objects whennamed; puts 2\u20134 wordstogether in a sentenceSorts shapes and colors;follows 2-step instructionsTABLE 9.4"

Piaget thought that children\u2019s ability to understand objects\u2014such as learning that a rattle makes anoise when shaken\u2014was a cognitive skill that develops slowly as a child matures and interacts with theenvironment. Today, developmental psychologists think Piaget was incorrect. Researchers have found thateven very young children understand objects and how they work long before they have experience with thoseobjects (Baillargeon, 1987; Baillargeon, Li, Gertner, & Wu, 2011). For example, children as young as 3 monthsold demonstrated knowledge of the properties of objects that they had only viewed and did not have priorexperience with them. In one study, 3-month-old infants were shown a truck rolling down a track and behind ascreen. The box, which appeared solid but was actually hollow, was placed next to the track. The truck rolledpast the box as would be expected. Then the box was placed on the track to block the path of the truck. Whenthe truck was rolled down the track this time, it continued unimpeded. The infants spent significantly moretime looking at this impossible event (Figure 9.11). Baillargeon (1987) concluded that they knew solid objectscannot pass through each other. Baillargeon\u2019s findings suggest that very young children have an understandingof objects and how they work, which Piaget (1954) would have said is beyond their cognitive abilities due totheir limited experiences in the world.FIGURE 9.11 In Baillargeon\u2019s study, infants observed a truck (a) roll down an unobstructed track, (b) roll down anunobstructed track with an obstruction (box) beside it, and (c) roll down and pass through what appeared to be anobstruction.Just as there are physical milestones that we expect children to reach, there are also cognitive milestones. It ishelpful to be aware of these milestones as children gain new abilities to think, problem solve, andcommunicate. For example, infants shake their head \u201cno\u201d around 6\u20139 months, and they respond to verbalrequests to do things like \u201cwave bye-bye\u201d or \u201cblow a kiss\u201d around 9\u201312 months. Remember Piaget\u2019s ideasabout object permanence? We can expect children to grasp the concept that objects continue to exist evenwhen they are not in sight by around 8 months old.

Toddlers also point to pictures in books and look in appropriate places whenyou ask them to find objects.Preschool-age children (i.e., 3\u20135 years old) also make steady progress in cognitive development. Not only canthey count, name colors, and tell you their name and age, but they can also make some decisions on their own,such as choosing an outfit to wear. Preschool-age children understand basic time concepts and sequencing(e.g., before and after), and they can predict what will happen next in a story. They also begin to enjoy the useof humor in stories. Because they can think symbolically, they enjoy pretend play and inventing elaboratecharacters and scenarios. One of the most common examples of their cognitive growth is their blossomingcuriosity. Preschool-age children love to ask \u201cWhy?\u201dAn important cognitive change occurs in children this age. Recall that Piaget described 2\u20133 year olds asegocentric, meaning that they do not have an awareness of others\u2019 points of view. Between 3 and 5 years old,children come to understand that people have thoughts, feelings, and beliefs that are different from their own.This is known as theory-of-mind (TOM). Children can use this skill to tease others, persuade their parents topurchase a candy bar, or understand why a sibling might be angry. When children develop TOM, they canrecognize that others have false beliefs (Dennett, 1987; Callaghan et al., 2005).LINK TO LEARNINGFalse-belief tasks are useful in determining a child\u2019s acquisition of theory-of-mind (TOM). Take a look at thisvideo clip that shows a false belief task involving a box of crayons (http://openstax.org/l/crayons) to learn more.Cognitive skills continue to expand in middle and late childhood (6\u201311 years old). Thought processes becomemore logical and organized when dealing with concrete information (Figure 9.12). Children at this ageunderstand concepts such as the past, present, and future, giving them the ability to plan and work towardgoals. Additionally, they can process complex ideas such as addition and subtraction and cause-and-effectrelationships. However, children\u2019s attention spans tend to be very limited until they are around 11 years old.After that point, it begins to improve through adulthood.FIGURE 9.12 Because they understand luck and fairness, children in middle and late childhood (6\u201311 years old)are able to follow rules for games. (credit: Edwin Martinez)One well-researched aspect of cognitive development is language acquisition. As mentioned earlier, the orderin which children learn language structures is consistent across children and cultures (Hatch, 1983). You\u2019vealso learned that some psychological researchers have proposed that children possess a biologicalpredisposition for language acquisition.Starting before birth, babies begin to develop language and communication skills. At birth, babies apparentlyrecognize their mother\u2019s voice and can discriminate between the language(s) spoken by their mothers andforeign languages, and they show preferences for faces that are moving in synchrony with audible language(Blossom & Morgan, 2006; Pickens, 1994; Spelke & Cortelyou, 1981).Children communicate information through gesturing long before they speak, and there is some evidence that"

In terms ofproducing spoken language, babies begin to coo almost immediately. Cooing is a one-syllable combination of aconsonant and a vowel sound (e.g., coo or ba). Interestingly, babies replicate sounds from their own languages.A baby whose parents speak French will coo in a different tone than a baby whose parents speak Spanish orUrdu. After cooing, the baby starts to babble. Babbling begins with repeating a syllable, such as ma-ma, da-da,or ba-ba. When babies are about 12 months old, we expect them to say their first word for meaning, and tostart combining words for meaning at about 18 months.At about 2 years old, a toddler uses between 50 and 200 words; by 3 years old they have a vocabulary of up to1,000 words and can speak in sentences. During the early childhood years, children's vocabulary increases at arapid pace. This is sometimes referred to as the \u201cvocabulary spurt\u201d and has been claimed to involve anexpansion in vocabulary at a rate of 10\u201320 new words per week. Recent research may indicate that while somechildren experience these spurts, it is far from universal (as discussed in Ganger & Brent, 2004). It has beenestimated that, 5 year olds understand about 6,000 words, speak 2,000 words, and can define words andquestion their meanings. They can rhyme and name the days of the week. Seven year olds speak fluently anduse slang and clich\u00e9s (Stork & Widdowson, 1974).What accounts for such dramatic language learning by children? Behaviorist B. F. Skinner thought that welearn language in response to reinforcement or feedback, such as through parental approval or through beingunderstood. For example, when a two-year-old child asks for juice, he might say, \u201cme juice,\u201d to which hismother might respond by giving him a cup of apple juice. Noam Chomsky (1957) criticized Skinner\u2019s theoryand proposed that we are all born with an innate capacity to learn language. Chomsky called this mechanism alanguage acquisition device (LAD). Who is correct? Both Chomsky and Skinner are right. Remember that weare a product of both nature and nurture. Researchers now believe that language acquisition is partially inbornand partially learned through our interactions with our linguistic environment (Gleitman & Newport, 1995;Stork & Widdowson, 1974).AttachmentPsychosocial development occurs as children form relationships, interact with others, and understand andmanage their feelings. In social and emotional development, forming healthy attachments is very importantand is the major social milestone of infancy. Attachment is a long-standing connection or bond with others.Developmental psychologists are interested in how infants reach this milestone. They ask such questions as:How do parent and infant attachment bonds form? How does neglect affect these bonds? What accounts forchildren\u2019s attachment differences?Researchers Harry Harlow, John Bowlby, and Mary Ainsworth conducted studies designed to answer thesequestions. In the 1950s, Harlow conducted a series of experiments on monkeys. He separated newbornmonkeys from their mothers. Each monkey was presented with two surrogate mothers. One surrogate monkeywas made out of wire mesh, and she could dispense milk. The other monkey was softer and made from cloth:This monkey did not dispense milk. Research shows that the monkeys preferred the soft, cuddly cloth monkey,even though she did not provide any nourishment. The baby monkeys spent their time clinging to the clothmonkey and only went to the wire monkey when they needed to be fed. Prior to this study, the medical andscientific communities generally thought that babies become attached to the people who provide theirnourishment. However, Harlow (1958) concluded that there was more to the mother-child bond thannourishment. Feelings of comfort and security are the critical components to maternal-infant bonding, whichleads to healthy psychosocial development.LINK TO LEARNINGHarlow\u2019s studies of monkeys were performed before modern ethics guidelines were in place, and today hisexperiments are widely considered to be unethical and even cruel.

Hedefined attachment as the affectional bond or tie that an infant forms with the mother (Bowlby, 1969). Aninfant must form this bond with a primary caregiver in order to have normal social and emotionaldevelopment. In addition, Bowlby proposed that this attachment bond is very powerful and continuesthroughout life. He used the concept of secure base to define a healthy attachment between parent and child(1988). A secure base is a parental presence that gives the child a sense of safety as he explores hissurroundings. Bowlby said that two things are needed for a healthy attachment: The caregiver must beresponsive to the child\u2019s physical, social, and emotional needs; and the caregiver and child must engage inmutually enjoyable interactions (Bowlby, 1969) (Figure 9.13).FIGURE 9.13 Mutually enjoyable interactions promote the parent-infant bond. (credit:\"balouriarajesh_Pixabay\"/Pixabay)While Bowlby thought attachment was an all-or-nothing process, Mary Ainsworth\u2019s (1970) research showedotherwise. Ainsworth wanted to know if children differ in the ways they bond, and if so, why. To find theanswers, she used the Strange Situation procedure to study attachment between mothers and their infants(1970). In the Strange Situation, the mother (or primary caregiver) and the infant (age 12-18 months) areplaced in a room together. There are toys in the room, and the caregiver and child spend some time alone inthe room. After the child has had time to explore her surroundings, a stranger enters the room. The motherthen leaves her baby with the stranger. After a few minutes, she returns to comfort her child.Based on how the infants/toddlers responded to the separation and reunion, Ainsworth identified three typesof parent-child attachments: secure, avoidant, and resistant (Ainsworth & Bell, 1970). A fourth style, known asdisorganized attachment, was later described (Main & Solomon, 1990). The most common type ofattachment\u2014also considered the healthiest\u2014is called secure attachment (Figure 9.14). In this type ofattachment, the toddler prefers his parent over a stranger. The attachment figure is used as a secure base toexplore the environment and is sought out in times of stress. Securely attached children were distressed whentheir caregivers left the room in the Strange Situation experiment, but when their caregivers returned, thesecurely attached children were happy to see them. Securely attached children have caregivers who aresensitive and responsive to their needs."

(credit: Kerry Ceszyk)With avoidant attachment, the child is unresponsive to the parent, does not use the parent as a secure base,and does not care if the parent leaves. The toddler reacts to the parent the same way she reacts to a stranger.When the parent does return, the child is slow to show a positive reaction. Ainsworth theorized that thesechildren were most likely to have a caregiver who was insensitive and inattentive to their needs (Ainsworth,Blehar, Waters, & Wall, 1978).In cases of resistant attachment, children tend to show clingy behavior, but then they reject the attachmentfigure\u2019s attempts to interact with them (Ainsworth & Bell, 1970). These children do not explore the toys in theroom, as they are too fearful. During separation in the Strange Situation, they became extremely disturbed andangry with the parent. When the parent returns, the children are difficult to comfort. Resistant attachment isthe result of the caregivers\u2019 inconsistent level of response to their child.Finally, children with disorganized attachment behaved oddly in the Strange Situation. They freeze, runaround the room in an erratic manner, or try to run away when the caregiver returns (Main & Solomon, 1990).This type of attachment is seen most often in kids who have been abused. Research has shown that abusedisrupts a child\u2019s ability to regulate their emotions.While Ainsworth\u2019s research has found support in subsequent studies, it has also met criticism. Someresearchers have pointed out that a child\u2019s temperament may have a strong influence on attachment (Gervai,2009; Harris, 2009), and others have noted that attachment varies from culture to culture, a factor notaccounted for in Ainsworth\u2019s research (Rothbaum, Weisz, Pott, Miyake, & Morelli, 2000; van Ijzendoorn & Sagi-Schwartz, 2008).LINK TO LEARNINGWatch this video clip of the Strange Situation (http://openstax.org/l/strangesitu) and try to identify which typeof attachment baby Lisa exhibits.Self-ConceptJust as attachment is the main psychosocial milestone of infancy, the primary psychosocial milestone ofchildhood is the development of a positive sense of self. How does self-awareness develop? Infants don\u2019t have aself-concept, which is an understanding of who they are. If you place a baby in front of a mirror, they will reachout to touch their image, thinking it is another baby. However, by about 18 months a toddler will recognize thatthe person in the mirror is themself. How do we know this? In a well-known experiment, a researcher placed ared dot of paint on children\u2019s noses before putting them in front of a mirror (Amsterdam, 1972). Commonlyknown as the mirror test, this behavior is demonstrated by humans and a few other species and is considered"

At 18 months old they would touch their own noses when they sawthe paint, surprised to see a spot on their faces. By 24\u201336 months old children can name and/or point tothemselves in pictures, clearly indicating self-recognition.Children from 2\u20134 years old display a great increase in social behavior once they have established a self-concept. They enjoy playing with other children, but they have difficulty sharing their possessions. Also,through play children explore and come to understand their gender roles and can label themselves as a girl orboy (Chick, Heilman-Houser, & Hunter, 2002). By 4 years old, children can cooperate with other children, sharewhen asked, and separate from parents with little anxiety. Children at this age also exhibit autonomy, initiatetasks, and carry out plans. Success in these areas contributes to a positive sense of self. Once children reach 6years old, they can identify themselves in terms of group memberships: \u201cI\u2019m a first grader!\u201d School-agechildren compare themselves to their peers and discover that they are competent in some areas and less so inothers (recall Erikson\u2019s task of industry versus inferiority). At this age, children recognize their own personalitytraits as well as some other traits they would like to have. For example, 10-year-old Layla says, \u201cI\u2019m kind of shy.I wish I could be more talkative like my friend Alexa.\u201dDevelopment of a positive self-concept is important to healthy development. Children with a positive self-concept tend to be more confident, do better in school, act more independently, and are more willing to trynew activities (Maccoby, 1980; Ferrer & Fugate, 2003). Formation of a positive self-concept begins in Erikson\u2019stoddlerhood stage, when children establish autonomy and become confident in their abilities. Development ofself-concept continues in elementary school, when children compare themselves to others. When thecomparison is favorable, children feel a sense of competence and are motivated to work harder andaccomplish more. Self-concept is re-evaluated in Erikson\u2019s adolescence stage, as teens form an identity. Theyinternalize the messages they have received regarding their strengths and weaknesses, keeping somemessages and rejecting others. Adolescents who have achieved identity formation are capable of contributingpositively to society (Erikson, 1968).DIG DEEPERPhenomenological Variant of Ecological Systems Theory (PVEST)Kenneth and Mamie Clark were pioneering psychologists responsible for the first psychological study used in aSupreme Court case. Their research with African American children and doll choices was used to highlight theharmful effects of segregation and provided support for the Browns and the NAACP in their lawsuit against theBoard of Education. The finding that African American children were more likely to choose a White doll over aBlack doll, in both northern and southern states, led them to theorize that the children did not have a healthyconcept of themselves (Clark & Clark, 1950).The Clarks\u2019 research differed from that of Inez Beverly Prosser, who also studied African American children insegregated and integrated schools in Cincinnati. Parents could choose either environment for their childrenduring the 1930s. She found, among other factors, that the self-concept of children at segregated schools wasmore positive versus those in integrated schools, partly due to teachers\u2019 low expectations. Prosser also notedthat the child\u2019s personality should be considered when choosing a segregated school or an integrated school(Benjamin, Henry, & McMahon, 2005).Later researchers suggested that African American children choosing a doll that did not look like them was not anindication of their self-esteem or their self-image. For instance, Rogers and Meltzoff (2017) found that genderidentity was more important than race in their study of diverse children whose average age was about 10 yearsold. Thus, for children that young, the meaning of race is an evolving process, as opposed to adolescents\u2019 searchfor identity. The ethnic minority children in the study did view racial identity as important, compared to theirWhite counterparts."

Racial socialization involves teaching them the positive aspects of their in-group, usually by caregivers. Most of the students in a study by Neblett, Smalls, Ford, Nguyen, and Sellers (2009)reported having received such messages but a few received no racial socialization messages. They found thatthese messages played a role in how they felt about their in-group.Some theories have been developed to explain the behaviors of ethnic minority youth. One such theory is thePhenomenological Variant of Ecological Systems Theory (PVEST), put forth by Margaret Beale Spencer. It is amerging of phenomenology and Bronfenbrenner\u2019s ecological systems theory. A phenomenological approach isbased on how a person makes meaning of their experiences. For example, young African American boys havedifferent experiences in educational settings compared to African American girls. Consequently, the meaningthey assign to those experiences differs. Bronfenbrenner\u2019s ecological systems theory suggests that developmentoccurs based on interactions among environments such as school, family, and community (Bronfenbrenner,1977).The research that Spencer, Dupree, and Hartmann (1997) conducted with African American adolescent boys andgirls was explained by PVEST. They found that negative learning attitudes were predicted by unpopularity withpeers for girls and boys. Additionally, for boys, more stress predicted a less negative attitude toward learning,possibly due to focus on the school environment instead of on personal issues. This occurred along withperceiving that teachers had positive expectations of African American boys. The researchers surmised thatPVEST accounted for how others\u2019 perceptions and their subsequent attitudes were related and worked bothways.What can parents do to nurture a healthy self-concept? Diana Baumrind (1971, 1991) thinks parenting stylemay be a factor. The way we parent is an important factor in a child\u2019s socioemotional growth. Baumrinddeveloped and refined a theory describing four parenting styles: authoritative, authoritarian, permissive, anduninvolved. With the authoritative style, the parent gives reasonable demands and consistent limits,expresses warmth and affection, and listens to the child\u2019s point of view. Parents set rules and explain thereasons behind them. They are also flexible and willing to make exceptions to the rules in certain cases\u2014forexample, temporarily relaxing bedtime rules to allow for a nighttime swim during a family vacation. Of the fourparenting styles, the authoritative style is the one that is most encouraged in modern American society.American children raised by authoritative parents tend to have high self-esteem and social skills. However,effective parenting styles vary as a function of culture and, as Small (1999) points out, the authoritative style isnot necessarily preferred or appropriate in all cultures.In authoritarian style, the parent places high value on conformity and obedience. The parents are often strict,tightly monitor their children, and express little warmth. In contrast to the authoritative style, authoritarianparents probably would not relax bedtime rules during a vacation because they consider the rules to be set,and they expect obedience. This style can create anxious, withdrawn, and unhappy kids. However, it isimportant to point out that authoritarian parenting is as beneficial as the authoritative style in some ethnicgroups (Russell, Crockett, & Chao, 2010). For instance, first-generation Chinese American children raised byauthoritarian parents did just as well in school as their peers who were raised by authoritative parents (Russellet al., 2010).For parents who employ the permissive style of parenting, the kids run the show and anything goes.Permissive parents make few demands and rarely use punishment. They tend to be very nurturing and loving,and may play the role of friend rather than parent. In terms of our example of vacation bedtimes, permissiveparents might not have bedtime rules at all\u2014instead they allow the child to choose their bedtime whether onvacation or not. Not surprisingly, children raised by permissive parents tend to lack self-discipline, and thepermissive parenting style is negatively associated with grades (Dornbusch, Ritter, Leiderman, Roberts, &"

        "data": "Page 306306 9 \u2022 Lifespan DevelopmentFraleigh, 1987). The permissive style may also contribute to other risky behaviors such as alcohol abuse (Bahr& Hoffman, 2010), risky sexual behavior especially among female children (Donenberg, Wilson, Emerson, &Bryant, 2002), and increased display of disruptive behaviors by male children (Parent et al., 2011). However,there are some positive outcomes associated with children raised by permissive parents. They tend to havehigher self-esteem, better social skills, and report lower levels of depression (Darling, 1999).With the uninvolved style of parenting, the parents are indifferent, uninvolved, and sometimes referred to asneglectful. They don\u2019t respond to the child\u2019s needs and make relatively few demands. This could be because ofsevere depression or substance abuse, or other factors such as the parents\u2019 extreme focus on work. Theseparents may provide for the child\u2019s basic needs, but little else. The children raised in this parenting style areusually emotionally withdrawn, fearful, anxious, perform poorly in school, and are at an increased risk ofsubstance abuse (Darling, 1999).As you can see, parenting styles influence childhood adjustment, but could a child\u2019s temperament likewiseinfluence parenting? Temperament refers to innate traits that influence how one thinks, behaves, and reactswith the environment. Children with easy temperaments demonstrate positive emotions, adapt well to change,and are capable of regulating their emotions. Conversely, children with difficult temperaments demonstratenegative emotions and have difficulty adapting to change and regulating their emotions. Difficult children aremuch more likely to challenge parents, teachers, and other caregivers (Thomas, 1984). Therefore, it\u2019s possiblethat easy children (i.e., social, adaptable, and easy to soothe) tend to elicit warm and responsive parenting,while demanding, irritable, withdrawn children evoke irritation in their parents or cause their parents towithdraw (Sanson & Rothbart, 1995).EVERYDAY CONNECTIONThe Importance of Play and RecessAccording to the American Academy of Pediatrics (2007), unstructured play is an integral part of a child\u2019sdevelopment. It builds creativity, problem solving skills, and social relationships. Play also allows children todevelop a theory-of-mind as they imaginatively take on the perspective of others.Outdoor play allows children the opportunity to directly experience and sense the world around them. Whiledoing so, they may collect objects that they come across and develop lifelong interests and hobbies. They alsobenefit from increased exercise, and engaging in outdoor play can actually increase how much they enjoyphysical activity. This helps support the development of a healthy heart and brain. Unfortunately, researchsuggests that today\u2019s children are engaging in less and less outdoor play (Clements, 2004). Perhaps, it is nosurprise to learn that lowered levels of physical activity in conjunction with easy access to calorie-dense foodswith little nutritional value are contributing to alarming levels of childhood obesity (Karnik & Kanekar, 2012).Despite the adverse consequences associated with reduced play, some children are over scheduled and havelittle free time to engage in unstructured play. In addition, some schools have taken away recess time for childrenin a push for students to do better on standardized tests, and many schools commonly use loss of recess as aform of punishment. Do you agree with these practices? Why or why not?AdolescenceAdolescence is a socially constructed concept. In pre-industrial society, children were considered adults whenthey reached physical maturity, but today we have an extended time between childhood and adulthood calledadolescence. Adolescence is the period of development that begins at puberty and ends at emergingadulthood, which is discussed later. In the United States, adolescence is seen as a time to developindependence from parents while remaining connected to them (Figure 9.15). The typical age range ofadolescence is from 12 to 18 years, and this stage of development also has some predictable physical,"

(credit: \"manseok_Pixabay\"/Pixabay)Physical DevelopmentAs noted above, adolescence begins with puberty. While the sequence of physical changes in puberty ispredictable, the onset and pace of puberty vary widely. Several physical changes occur during puberty, such asadrenarche and gonadarche, the maturing of the adrenal glands and sex glands, respectively. Also during thistime, primary and secondary sexual characteristics develop and mature. Primary sexual characteristics areorgans specifically needed for reproduction, like the uterus and ovaries in females and testes in males.Secondary sexual characteristics are physical signs of sexual maturation that do not directly involve sexorgans, such as development of breasts and hips in females, and development of facial hair and a deepenedvoice in males. Females experience menarche, the beginning of menstrual periods, usually around 12\u201313years old, and males experience spermarche, the first ejaculation, around 13\u201314 years old.During puberty, people experience a rapid increase in height (i.e., growth spurt). For females this beginsbetween 8 and 13 years old, with adult height reached between 10 and 16 years old. Males begin their growthspurt slightly later, usually between 10 and 16 years old, and reach their adult height between 13 and 17 yearsold. Both nature (i.e., genes) and nurture (e.g., nutrition, medications, and medical conditions) can influenceheight.Because rates of physical development vary so widely among teenagers, puberty can be a source of pride orembarrassment. Early maturing boys tend to be stronger, taller, and more athletic than their later maturingpeers. They are usually more popular, confident, and independent, but they are also at a greater risk forsubstance abuse and early sexual activity (Flannery, Rowe, & Gulley, 1993; Kaltiala-Heino, Rimpela, Rissanen,& Rantanen, 2001). Early maturing girls may be teased or overtly admired, which can cause them to feel self-conscious about their developing bodies. These girls are at a higher risk for depression, substance abuse, andeating disorders (Ge, Conger, & Elder, 2001; Graber, Lewinsohn, Seeley, & Brooks-Gunn, 1997; Striegel-Moore &Cachelin, 1999). Late blooming boys and girls (i.e., they develop more slowly than their peers) may feel self-conscious about their lack of physical development. Negative feelings are particularly a problem for latematuring boys, who are at a higher risk for depression and conflict with parents (Graber et al., 1997) and morelikely to be bullied (Pollack & Shuster, 2000).Psychologists and clinicians also study the impact of gender identity and the impacts of puberty ontransgender and gender-nonconforming youth. This is a relatively recent area of study, and the impacts shouldnot be over-generalized. However, the research seems to indicate that transgender and gender-nonconformingyouth who are supported in their identity do not have significantly higher incidences of depression or anxietysymptoms when compared to control groups, while those who are not supported exhibit more symptoms andrisk factors (Olson, Durwood, & McLaughlin, 2016). Expression and exploration of gender identity can takemany forms and manifest at different times depending on a wide array of factors.The adolescent brain also remains under development. Up until puberty, brain cells continue to bloom in thefrontal region. Adolescents engage in increased risk-taking behaviors and emotional outbursts possiblybecause the frontal lobes of their brains are still developing (Figure 9.16). Recall that this area is responsiblefor judgment, impulse control, and planning, and it is still maturing into early adulthood (Casey, Tottenham,"

Some researchers suggest this is due to increasesin processing speed and efficiency rather than as the result of an increase in mental capacity\u2014in other words,due to improvements in existing skills rather than development of new ones (Bjorkland, 1987; Case, 1985).During adolescence, teenagers move beyond concrete thinking and become capable of abstract thought. Recallthat Piaget refers to this stage as formal operational thought. Teen thinking is also characterized by the abilityto consider multiple points of view, imagine hypothetical situations, debate ideas and opinions (e.g., politics,religion, and justice), and form new ideas (Figure 9.17). In addition, it\u2019s not uncommon for adolescents toquestion authority or challenge established societal norms.Cognitive empathy, also known as theory-of-mind (which we discussed earlier with regard to egocentrism),relates to the ability to take the perspective of others and feel concern for others (Shamay-Tsoory, Tomer, &Aharon-Peretz, 2005). Cognitive empathy begins to increase in adolescence and is an important component ofsocial problem solving and conflict avoidance. According to one longitudinal study, levels of cognitive empathybegin rising in girls around 13 years old, and around 15 years old in boys (Van der Graaff et al., 2013). Teenswho reported having supportive fathers with whom they could discuss their worries were found to be betterable to take the perspective of others (Miklikowska, Duriez, & Soenens, 2011)."

Erikson referred to the task of theadolescent as one of identity versus role confusion. Thus, in Erikson\u2019s view, an adolescent\u2019s main questions are\u201cWho am I?\u201d and \u201cWho do I want to be?\u201d Some adolescents adopt the values and roles that their parents expectfor them. Other teens develop identities that are in opposition to their parents but align with a peer group. Thisis common as peer relationships become a central focus in adolescents\u2019 lives.As adolescents work to form their identities, they pull away from their parents, and the peer group becomesvery important (Shanahan, McHale, Osgood, & Crouter, 2007). Despite spending less time with their parents,most teens report positive feelings toward them (Moore, Guzman, Hair, Lippman, & Garrett, 2004). Warm andhealthy parent-child relationships have been associated with positive child outcomes, such as better gradesand fewer school behavior problems, in the United States as well as in other countries (Hair et al., 2005).It appears that most teens don\u2019t experience adolescent storm and stress to the degree once famously suggestedby G. Stanley Hall, a pioneer in the study of adolescent development. Only small numbers of teens have majorconflicts with their parents (Steinberg & Morris, 2001), and most disagreements are minor. For example, in astudy of over 1,800 parents of adolescents from various cultural and ethnic groups, Barber (1994) found thatconflicts occurred over day-to-day issues such as homework, money, curfews, clothing, chores, and friends.These types of arguments tend to decrease as teens develop (Galambos & Almeida, 1992). There is emergingresearch on the adolescent brain. Galvan, Hare, Voss, Glover and Casey (2007) examined its role in risk-takingbehavior. They used fMRI to assess the readings\u2019 relationship to risk-taking, risk perception, and impulsivity.The researchers found that there was no correlation between brain activity in the neural reward center andimpulsivity and risk perception. However, activity in that part of the brain was correlated to risk taking. Inother words, risk-taking adolescents experienced brain activity in the reward center. The idea that adolescents,however, are more impulsive than other demographics was challenged in their research, which includedchildren and adults.Emerging AdulthoodThe next stage of development is emerging adulthood. This is a relatively newly defined period of lifespandevelopment spanning from 18 years old to the mid-20s, characterized as an in-between time where identityexploration is focused on work and love.When does a person become an adult? There are many ways to answer this question. In the United States, youare legally considered an adult at 18 years old. But other definitions of adulthood vary widely; in sociology, forexample, a person may be considered an adult when they become self-supporting, choose a career, getmarried, or start a family. The ages at which we achieve these milestones vary from person to person as well asfrom culture to culture. For example, in the African country of Malawi, 15-year-old Njemile was married at 14years old and had her first child at 15 years old. In her culture she is considered an adult. Children in Malawitake on adult responsibilities such as marriage and work (e.g., carrying water, tending babies, and workingfields) as early as 10 years old. In stark contrast, independence in Western cultures is taking longer and longer,"

It seems thatemerging adulthood is a product of both Western culture and our current times (Arnett, 2000). People inhigher income and more industrialized countries are living longer, allowing the freedom to take an extradecade to start a career and family. Changes in the workforce also play a role. For example, 50 years ago, ayoung adult with a high school diploma could immediately enter the work force and climb the economicladder. That is no longer the case. Bachelor\u2019s and even graduate degrees are required more and moreoften\u2014even for entry-level jobs (Arnett, 2000). In addition, many students are taking longer (five or six years)to complete a college degree as a result of working and going to school at the same time. After graduation,many young adults return to the family home because they have difficulty finding a job. The term BoomerangGeneration describes recent college graduates for whom lack of adequate employment upon collegegraduation often leads to a return to the parental home (Davidson, 2014). Changing cultural expectations maybe the most important reason for the delay in entering adult roles. Young people are spending more timeexploring their options, so they are delaying marriage and work as they change majors and jobs multipletimes, putting them on a much later timetable than their parents (Arnett, 2000).AdulthoodAdulthood begins around 20 years old and has three distinct stages: early, middle, and late. Each stage bringsits own set of rewards and challenges.Physical DevelopmentBy the time we reach early adulthood (20 to early 40s), our physical maturation is complete, although ourheight and weight may increase slightly. In young adulthood, our physical abilities are at their peak, includingmuscle strength, reaction time, sensory abilities, and cardiac functioning. Most professional athletes are at thetop of their game during this stage. Many women have children in the young adulthood years, so they may seeadditional weight gain and breast changes.Middle adulthood extends from the 40s to the 60s (Figure 9.18). Physical decline is gradual. The skin losessome elasticity, and wrinkles are among the first signs of aging. Visual acuity decreases during this time.Women experience a gradual decline in fertility as they approach the onset of menopause, the end of themenstrual cycle, around 50 years old. Both men and women tend to gain weight: in the abdominal area formen and in the hips and thighs for women. Hair begins to thin and turn gray.FIGURE 9.18 Physical declines of middle and late adulthood can be minimized with proper exercise, nutrition, andan active lifestyle. (credit: modification of work by Peter Stevens)Late adulthood is considered to extend from the 60s on. This is the last stage of physical change. The skincontinues to lose elasticity, reaction time slows further, and muscle strength diminishes. Smell, taste, hearing,and vision, so sharp in our twenties, decline significantly. The brain may also no longer function at optimallevels, leading to problems like memory loss, dementia, and Alzheimer\u2019s disease in later years."

Watch thisinspiring story about Neil Unger who is a newbie to the world of skateboarding at 60 years old(http://openstax.org/l/Unger) to learn more.Cognitive DevelopmentBecause we spend so many years in adulthood (more than any other stage), cognitive changes are numerous.In fact, research suggests that adult cognitive development is a complex, ever changing process that may beeven more active than cognitive development in infancy and early childhood (Fischer, Yan, & Stewart, 2003).LINK TO LEARNINGThere is good news for the middle age brain. View this brief video about the middle age brain(http://openstax.org/l/oldbrain) to find out what it is.Unlike our physical abilities, which peak in our mid-20s and then begin a slow decline, our cognitive abilitiesremain steady throughout early and middle adulthood. Our crystallized intelligence (information, skills, andstrategies we have gathered through a lifetime of experience) tends to hold steady as we age\u2014it may evenimprove. For example, adults show relatively stable to increasing scores on intelligence tests until theirmid-30s to mid-50s (Bayley & Oden, 1955). However, in late adulthood we begin to experience a decline inanother area of our cognitive abilities\u2014fluid intelligence (information processing abilities, reasoning, andmemory). These processes become slower. How can we delay the onset of cognitive decline? Mental andphysical activity seems to play a part (Figure 9.19). Research has found adults who engage in mentally andphysically stimulating activities experience less cognitive decline and have a reduced incidence of mildcognitive impairment and dementia (Hertzog, Kramer, Wilson, & Lindenberger, 2009; Larson et al., 2006;Podewils et al., 2005).FIGURE 9.19 Cognitive activities such as playing mahjong, chess, or other games, can keep you mentally fit. Thesame is true for solo pastimes like reading and completing crossword puzzles. (credit: Philippe Put)Researchers have examined the aging brain by comparing it to brain functioning in younger people.Forstmann and colleagues (2011) compared elderly participants to younger participants, who in the studywere asked to report the direction of movement of a set of dots. They were given feedback regarding speed andaccuracy. The researchers found that older participants made more errors and were slower due todegeneration of corticostriatal connections. In other words, the decreased ability typically assigned to elderlypeople may be due to circumstances in the brain beyond their control. Interestingly, other researchers havefound similarities in spatial representations when comparing children aged 6\u20137 to those over the age of 80.Ruggiero, D\u2019Errico, and Iachini (2016) reported that this is due to neurodegeneration in older adults andimmature neurology in young children.Many elderly people experience dementia, changes in the brain that negatively affect cognition.

Plaques in the brain are due to cell death, which then causes those affected withthe disease severe forgetfulness. A person can forget how to walk, talk, and eventually eat. The disease can bemitigated by assessing environmental factors (exposure to lead, iron, and zinc increase risk) and nutritionalfactors (the Mediterranean diet lowers risk) (Arora, Mittal, & Kakkar, 2015). Although there is no cure, there ishope. Cognitive rehabilitation can offset mild cognitive impairment, as it can evolve into dementia. Garcia-Betances, Jimenez-Mixco, Arredondo, and Cabrera-Umpierrez (2015) examined the use of virtual reality as apossible cognitive rehabilitative method. They suggested that virtual reality technology should involve dailyliving activities, memory, and language, among other considerations.Psychosocial DevelopmentThere are many theories about the social and emotional aspects of aging. Some aspects of healthy aginginclude activities, social connectedness, and the role of a person\u2019s culture. According to many theorists,including George Vaillant (2002), who studied and analyzed over 50 years of data, we need to have andcontinue to find meaning throughout our lives. For those in early and middle adulthood, meaning is foundthrough work (Sterns & Huyck, 2001) and family life (Markus, Ryff, Curan, & Palmersheim, 2004). These areasrelate to the tasks that Erikson referred to as generativity and intimacy. As mentioned previously, adults tendto define themselves by what they do\u2014their careers. Earnings peak during this time, yet job satisfaction ismore closely tied to work that involves contact with other people, is interesting, provides opportunities foradvancement, and allows some independence (Mohr & Zoghi, 2006) than it is to salary (Iyengar, Wells, &Schwartz, 2006). How might being unemployed or being in a dead-end job challenge adult well-being?Positive relationships with significant others in our adult years have been found to contribute to a state of well-being (Ryff & Singer, 2009). Most adults in the United States identify themselves through their relationshipswith family\u2014particularly with spouses, children, and parents (Markus et al., 2004). While raising children canbe stressful, especially when they are young, research suggests that parents reap the rewards down the road,as adult children tend to have a positive effect on parental well-being (Umberson, Pudrovska, & Reczek, 2010).Having a stable marriage has also been found to contribute to well-being throughout adulthood (Vaillant,2002).Another aspect of positive aging is believed to be social connectedness and social support. As we get older,socioemotional selectivity theory suggests that our social support and friendships dwindle in number, butremain as close, if not more close than in our earlier years (Carstensen, 1992) (Figure 9.20).FIGURE 9.20 Social support is important as we age.

Death marks the end of your life story (Figure 9.21). Our culture and individualbackgrounds influence how we view death. In some cultures, death is accepted as a natural part of life and isembraced. In contrast, until about 50 years ago in the United States, a doctor might not inform someone thatthey were dying, and the majority of deaths occurred in hospitals. In 1967 that reality began to change withCicely Saunders, who created the first modern hospice in England. The aim of hospice is to help provide adeath with dignity and pain management in a humane and comfortable environment, which is usually outsideof a hospital setting. In 1974, Florence Wald founded the first hospice in the United States. Today, hospiceprovides care for 1.65 million Americans and their families. Because of hospice care, many terminally illpeople are able to spend their last days at home.FIGURE 9.21 Different cultures, societies, and religions have varying practices surrounding death. For example,people\u2019s bodies may be (a) buried in a cemetery, (b) cremated and buried at sea as in this U.S. Navy ceremony, or (c)cremated such as in this Hindu ceremony in Bali. (credit a: modification of work by Christina Rutz; credit b:modification of work by Chief Journalist Alan J. Baribeau/Wikimedia; credit c: modification of work by\"CazzJj_Flickr\"/Flickr)Research has indicated that hospice care is beneficial for the patient (Brumley, Enquidanos, & Cherin, 2003;Brumley et al., 2007; Godkin, Krant, & Doster, 1984) and for the patient\u2019s family (Rhodes, Mitchell, Miller,Connor, & Teno, 2008; Godkin et al., 1984). Hospice patients report high levels of satisfaction with hospice carebecause they are able to remain at home and are not completely dependent on strangers for care (Brumley etal., 2007). In addition, hospice patients tend to live longer than non-hospice patients (Connor, Pyenson, Fitch,Spence, & Iwasaki, 2007; Temel et al., 2010). Family members receive emotional support and are regularlyinformed of their loved one\u2019s treatment and condition. The family member\u2019s burden of care is also reduced(McMillan et al., 2006). Both the patient and the patient\u2019s family members report increased family support,increased social support, and improved coping while receiving hospice services (Godkin et al., 1984).How do you think you might react if you were diagnosed with a terminal illness like cancer? Elizabeth K\u00fcbler-Ross (1969), who worked with the founders of hospice care, described the process of an individual acceptinghis own death. She proposed five stages of grief: denial, anger, bargaining, depression, and acceptance. Mostindividuals experience these stages, but the stages may occur in different orders, depending on the individual.In addition, not all people experience all of the stages. It is also important to note that some psychologistsbelieve that the more a dying person fights death, the more likely they are to remain stuck in the denial phase."

However, other psychologistsbelieve that not facing death until the very end is an adaptive coping mechanism for some people.Whether due to illness or old age, not everyone facing death or the loss of a loved one experiences the negativeemotions outlined in the K\u00fcbler-Ross model (Nolen-Hoeksema & Larson, 1999). For example, researchsuggests that people with religious or spiritual beliefs are better able to cope with death because of their hopein an afterlife and because of social support from religious or spiritual associations (Hood, Spilka, Hunsberger,& Corsuch, 1996; McIntosh, Silver, & Wortman, 1993; Paloutzian, 1996; Samarel, 1991; Wortman & Park,2008).A prominent example of a person creating meaning through death is Randy Pausch, who was a well-loved andrespected professor at Carnegie Mellon University. Diagnosed with terminal pancreatic cancer in his mid-40sand given only 3\u20136 months to live, Pausch focused on living in a fulfilling way in the time he had left. Instead ofbecoming angry and depressed, he presented his now famous last lecture called \u201cReally Achieving YourChildhood Dreams.\u201d In his moving, yet humorous talk, he shares his insights on seeing the good in others,overcoming obstacles, and experiencing zero gravity, among many other things. Despite his terminaldiagnosis, Pausch lived the final year of his life with joy and hope, showing us that our plans for the future stillmatter, even if we know that we are dying.LINK TO LEARNINGListen to Randy Pausch's last lecture titled Really Achieving Your Childhood Dreams (http://openstax.org/l/lastlecture) to learn more.As individuals become more knowledgeable about medical procedures and practices, some people want toensure that their wishes and desires are known in advance. This ensures that if the person ever becomesincapacitated or can no longer express themselves, their loved ones will know what they want. For this reason,a person might write a living will or advance directive, which is a written legal document that details specificinterventions a person wants. For example, a person in the last stages of a terminal illness may not want toreceive life-extending treatments. A person may also include a Do Not Resuscitate (DNR) Order, which theywould share this with family and close friends. A DNR Order states that if a person stops breathing or theirheart stops beating, medical personnel such as doctors and nurses are notto take steps to revive or resuscitatethe patient. A living will can also include a health care proxy, which appoints a specific person to makemedical decisions for you if you are unable to speak for yourself. People\u2019s desire for living wills and DNRs areoften influenced by their religion, culture, and upbringing."

This marksthe beginning of the first stage of prenatal development (germinal stage), which lasts about two weeks. Thenthe zygote implants itself into the lining of the uterus, marking the beginning of the second stage of prenataldevelopment (embryonic stage), which lasts about six weeks. The embryo begins to develop body and organstructures, and the neural tube forms, which will later become the brain and spinal cord. The third phase ofprenatal development (fetal stage) begins at 9 weeks and lasts until birth. The body, brain, and organs growrapidly during this stage. During all stages of pregnancy it is important that the parent receive prenatal care toreduce health risks to themself and to the developing baby.Newborn infants weigh about 7.5 pounds. Doctors assess a newborn\u2019s reflexes, such as the sucking, rooting,and Moro reflexes. Our physical, cognitive, and psychosocial skills grow and change as we move throughdevelopmental stages from infancy through late adulthood. Attachment in infancy is a critical component ofhealthy development. Parenting styles have been found to have an effect on childhood outcomes of well-being.The transition from adolescence to adulthood can be challenging due to the timing of puberty, and due to theextended amount of time spent in emerging adulthood. Although physical decline begins in middle adulthood,cognitive decline does not begin until later. Activities that keep the body and mind active can help maintaingood physical and cognitive health as we age. Social supports through family and friends remain important aswe age."

What motivations underlie our behaviors? Motivation describes the wants orneeds that direct behavior toward a goal. In addition to biological motives, motivations can be intrinsic(arising from internal factors) or extrinsic (arising from external factors) (Figure 10.2). Intrinsically motivatedbehaviors are performed because of the sense of personal satisfaction that they bring, while extrinsicallymotivated behaviors are performed in order to receive something from others.FIGURE 10.2 Intrinsic motivation comes from within the individual, while extrinsic motivation comes from outsidethe individual.Think about why you are pursuing an education. Are you here because you enjoy learning and want to pursuean education to make yourself a more well-rounded individual? If so, then you are intrinsically motivated.However, if you are here because you want to get a college degree to make yourself more marketable for a high-paying career or to satisfy the demands of your parents, then your motivation is more extrinsic in nature.In reality, our motivations are often a mix of both intrinsic and extrinsic factors, but the nature of the mix ofthese factors might change over time (often in ways that seem counter-intuitive). There is an old adage:\u201cChoose a job that you love, and you will never have to work a day in your life,\u201d meaning that if you enjoy youroccupation, work doesn\u2019t seem like . . . well, work. Some research suggests that this isn\u2019t necessarily the case(Daniel & Esser, 1980; Deci, 1972; Deci, Koestner, & Ryan, 1999). According to this research, receiving somesort of extrinsic reinforcement (i.e., getting paid) for engaging in behaviors that we enjoy leads to thosebehaviors being thought of as work no longer providing that same enjoyment. As a result, we might spend lesstime engaging in these reclassified behaviors in the absence of any extrinsic reinforcement. For example,Odessa loves baking, so in her free time, she bakes for fun. Oftentimes, after stocking shelves at her grocerystore job, she often whips up pastries in the evenings because she enjoys baking. When a coworker in thestore\u2019s bakery department leaves his job, Odessa applies for his position and gets transferred to the bakerydepartment. Although she enjoys what she does in her new job, after a few months, she no longer has muchdesire to concoct tasty treats in her free time. Baking has become work in a way that changes her motivation todo it (Figure 10.3). What Odessa has experienced is called the overjustification effect\u2014intrinsic motivation isdiminished when extrinsic motivation is given. This can lead to extinguishing the intrinsic motivation andcreating a dependence on extrinsic rewards for continued performance (Deci et al., 1999)."

(credit: Agust\u00edn Ruiz)Other studies suggest that intrinsic motivation may not be so vulnerable to the effects of extrinsicreinforcements, and in fact, reinforcements such as verbal praise might actually increase intrinsic motivation(Arnold, 1976; Cameron & Pierce, 1994). In that case, Odessa\u2019s motivation to bake in her free time mightremain high if, for example, customers regularly compliment her baking or cake decorating skills.These apparent discrepancies in the researchers\u2019 findings may be understood by considering several factors.For one, physical reinforcement (such as money) and verbal reinforcement (such as praise) may affect anindividual in very different ways. In fact, tangible rewards (i.e., money) tend to have more negative effects onintrinsic motivation than do intangible rewards (i.e., praise). Furthermore, the expectation of the extrinsicmotivator by an individual is crucial: If the person expects to receive an extrinsic reward, then intrinsicmotivation for the task tends to be reduced. If, however, there is no such expectation, and the extrinsicmotivation is presented as a surprise, then intrinsic motivation for the task tends to persist (Deci et al., 1999).In addition, culture may influence motivation. For example, in collectivistic cultures, it is common to do thingsfor your family members because the emphasis is on the group and what is best for the entire group, ratherthan what is best for any one individual (Nisbett, Peng, Choi, & Norenzayan, 2001). This focus on othersprovides a broader perspective that takes into account both situational and cultural influences on behavior;thus, a more nuanced explanation of the causes of others\u2019 behavior becomes more likely. (You will learn moreabout collectivistic and individualistic cultures when you learn about social psychology.)In educational settings, students are more likely to experience intrinsic motivation to learn when they feel asense of belonging and respect in the classroom. This internalization can be enhanced if the evaluative aspectsof the classroom are de-emphasized and if students feel that they exercise some control over the learningenvironment. Furthermore, providing students with activities that are challenging, yet doable, along with arationale for engaging in various learning activities can enhance intrinsic motivation for those tasks (Niemiec& Ryan, 2009). Consider Hakim, a first-year law student with two courses this semester: Family Law andCriminal Law. The Family Law professor has a rather intimidating classroom: He likes to put students on thespot with tough questions, which often leaves students feeling belittled or embarrassed. Grades are basedexclusively on quizzes and exams, and the instructor posts results of each test on the classroom door. Incontrast, the Criminal Law professor facilitates classroom discussions and respectful debates in small groups.The majority of the course grade is not exam-based, but centers on a student-designed research project on acrime issue of the student\u2019s choice. Research suggests that Hakim will be less intrinsically motivated in hisFamily Law course, where students are intimidated in the classroom setting, and there is an emphasis onteacher-driven evaluations. Hakim is likely to experience a higher level of intrinsic motivation in his CriminalLaw course, where the class setting encourages inclusive collaboration and a respect for ideas, and wherestudents have more influence over their learning activities.Theories About MotivationWilliam James (1842\u20131910) was an important contributor to early research into motivation, and he is oftenreferred to as the father of psychology in the United States. James theorized that behavior was driven by anumber of instincts, which aid survival (Figure 10.4). From a biological perspective, an instinct is a species-"

There was, however, considerable controversy among Jamesand his contemporaries over the exact definition of instinct. James proposed several dozen special humaninstincts, but many of his contemporaries had their own lists that differed. A mother\u2019s protection of her baby,the urge to lick sugar, and hunting prey were among the human behaviors proposed as true instincts duringJames\u2019s era. This view\u2014that human behavior is driven by instincts\u2014received a fair amount of criticismbecause of the undeniable role of learning in shaping all sorts of human behavior. In fact, as early as the 1900s,some instinctive behaviors were experimentally demonstrated to result from associative learning (recall whenyou learned about Watson\u2019s conditioning of fear response in \u201cLittle Albert\u201d) (Faris, 1921).FIGURE 10.4 (a) William James proposed the instinct theory of motivation, asserting that behavior is driven byinstincts. (b) In humans, instincts may include behaviors such as an infant\u2019s rooting for a nipple and sucking. (creditb: modification of work by \"Mothering Touch\"/Flickr)Another early theory of motivation proposed that the maintenance of homeostasis is particularly important indirecting behavior. You may recall from your earlier reading that homeostasis is the tendency to maintain abalance, or optimal level, within a biological system. In a body system, a control center (which is often part ofthe brain) receives input from receptors (which are often complexes of neurons). The control center directseffectors (which may be other neurons) to correct any imbalance detected by the control center.According to the drive theory of motivation, deviations from homeostasis create physiological needs. Theseneeds result in psychological drive states that direct behavior to meet the need and, ultimately, bring thesystem back to homeostasis. For example, if it\u2019s been a while since you ate, your blood sugar levels will dropbelow normal. This low blood sugar will induce a physiological need and a corresponding drive state (i.e.,hunger) that will direct you to seek out and consume food (Figure 10.5). Eating will eliminate the hunger, and,ultimately, your blood sugar levels will return to normal. Interestingly, drive theory also emphasizes the rolethat habits play in the type of behavioral response in which we engage. A habit is a pattern of behavior in whichwe regularly engage. Once we have engaged in a behavior that successfully reduces a drive, we are more likelyto engage in that behavior whenever faced with that drive in the future (Graham & Weiner, 1996).FIGURE 10.5 Hunger and subsequent eating are the result of complex physiological processes that maintain"

(credit \"left\": modification of work by \"Gracie and Viv\"/Flickr; credit \"center\": modification of work bySteven Depolo; credit \"right\": modification of work by Monica Renata)Extensions of drive theory take into account levels of arousal as potential motivators. As you recall from yourstudy of learning, these theories assert that there is an optimal level of arousal that we all try to maintain(Figure 10.6). If we are underaroused, we become bored and will seek out some sort of stimulation. On theother hand, if we are overaroused, we will engage in behaviors to reduce our arousal (Berlyne, 1960). Moststudents have experienced this need to maintain optimal levels of arousal over the course of their academiccareer. Think about how much stress students experience toward the end of spring semester. They feeloverwhelmed with seemingly endless exams, papers, and major assignments that must be completed on time.They probably yearn for the rest and relaxation that awaits them over the extended summer break. However,once they finish the semester, it doesn\u2019t take too long before they begin to feel bored. Generally, by the time thenext semester is beginning in the fall, many students are quite happy to return to school. This is an example ofhow arousal theory works.FIGURE 10.6 The concept of optimal arousal in relation to performance on a task is depicted here. Performance ismaximized at the optimal level of arousal, and it tapers off during under- and overarousal.So what is the optimal level of arousal? What level leads to the best performance? Research shows thatmoderate arousal is generally best; when arousal is very high or very low, performance tends to suffer (Yerkes& Dodson, 1908). Think of your arousal level regarding taking an exam for this class. If your level is very low,such as boredom and apathy, your performance will likely suffer. Similarly, a very high level, such as extremeanxiety, can be paralyzing and hinder performance. Consider the example of a softball team facing atournament. They are favored to win their first game by a large margin, so they go into the game with a lowerlevel of arousal and get beat by a less skilled team.But optimal arousal level is more complex than a simple answer that the middle level is always best.Researchers Robert Yerkes (pronounced \u201cYerk-EES\u201d) and John Dodson discovered that the optimal arousallevel depends on the complexity and difficulty of the task to be performed (Figure 10.7). This relationship isknown as Yerkes-Dodson law, which holds that a simple task is performed best when arousal levels arerelatively high and complex tasks are best performed when arousal levels are lower."

Albert Bandura (1994) theorized that an individual\u2019ssense of self-efficacy plays a pivotal role in motivating behavior. Bandura argues that motivation derives fromexpectations that we have about the consequences of our behaviors, and ultimately, it is the appreciation of ourcapacity to engage in a given behavior that will determine what we do and the future goals that we set forourselves. For example, if you have a sincere belief in your ability to achieve at the highest level, you are morelikely to take on challenging tasks and to not let setbacks dissuade you from seeing the task through to the end.A number of theorists have focused their research on understanding social motives (McAdams & Constantian,1983; McClelland & Liberman, 1949; Murray et al., 1938). Among the motives they describe are needs forachievement, affiliation, and intimacy. It is the need for achievement that drives accomplishment andperformance. The need for affiliation encourages positive interactions with others, and the need for intimacycauses us to seek deep, meaningful relationships. Henry Murray et al. (1938) categorized these needs intodomains. For example, the need for achievement and recognition falls under the domain of ambition.Dominance and aggression were recognized as needs under the domain of human power, and play was arecognized need in the domain of interpersonal affection.Maslow\u2019s Hierarchy of NeedsWhile the theories of motivation described earlier relate to basic biological drives, individual characteristics,or social contexts, Abraham Maslow (1943) proposed a hierarchy of needs that spans the spectrum of motivesranging from the biological to the individual to the social. These needs are often depicted as a pyramid (Figure10.8)."

In some versions of the pyramid, cognitive andaesthetic needs are also included between esteem and self-actualization. Others include another tier at the top ofthe pyramid for self-transcendence.At the base of the pyramid are all of the physiological needs that are necessary for survival. These are followedby basic needs for security and safety, the need to be loved and to have a sense of belonging, and the need tohave self-worth and confidence. The top tier of the pyramid is self-actualization, which is a need thatessentially equates to achieving one\u2019s full potential, and it can only be realized when needs lower on thepyramid have been met. To Maslow and humanistic theorists, self-actualization reflects the humanisticemphasis on positive aspects of human nature. Maslow suggested that this is an ongoing, life-long process andthat only a small percentage of people actually achieve a self-actualized state (Francis & Kritsonis, 2006;Maslow, 1943).According to Maslow (1943), one must satisfy lower-level needs before addressing those needs that occurhigher in the pyramid. So, for example, if someone is struggling to find enough food to meet their nutritionalrequirements, it is quite unlikely that they would spend an inordinate amount of time thinking about whetherothers viewed them as a good person or not. Instead, all of their energies would be geared toward findingsomething to eat. However, it should be pointed out that Maslow\u2019s theory has been criticized for its subjectivenature and its inability to account for phenomena that occur in the real world (Leonard, 1982). Other researchhas more recently addressed that late in life, Maslow proposed a self-transcendence level above self-actualization\u2014to represent striving for meaning and purpose beyond the concerns of oneself (Koltko-Rivera,2006). For example, people sometimes make self-sacrifices in order to make a political statement or in anattempt to improve the conditions of others. Mohandas K. Gandhi, a world-renowned advocate forindependence through nonviolent protest, on several occasions went on hunger strikes to protest a particularsituation. People may starve themselves or otherwise put themselves in danger displaying higher-levelmotives beyond their own needs.LINK TO LEARNINGCheck out this interactive exercise about Maslow's hierarchy of needs (http://openstax.org/l/hierneeds) to learnmore."

While this chapter will focus primarily on the physiological mechanisms that regulate hunger andeating, powerful social, cultural, and economic influences also play important roles. This section will explainthe regulation of hunger, eating, and body weight, and we will discuss the adverse consequences of disorderedeating.Physiological MechanismsThere are a number of physiological mechanisms that serve as the basis for hunger. When our stomachs areempty, they contract. Typically, a person then experiences hunger pangs. Chemical messages travel to thebrain, and serve as a signal to initiate feeding behavior. When our blood glucose levels drop, the pancreas andliver generate a number of chemical signals that induce hunger (Konturek et al., 2003; Novin, Robinson,Culbreth, & Tordoff, 1985) and thus initiate feeding behavior.For most people, once they have eaten, they feel satiation, or fullness and satisfaction, and their eatingbehavior stops. Like the initiation of eating, satiation is also regulated by several physiological mechanisms. Asblood glucose levels increase, the pancreas and liver send signals to shut off hunger and eating (Drazen &Woods, 2003; Druce, Small, & Bloom, 2004; Greary, 1990). The food\u2019s passage through the gastrointestinaltract also provides important satiety signals to the brain (Woods, 2004), and fat cells release leptin, a satietyhormone.The various hunger and satiety signals that are involved in the regulation of eating are integrated in the brain.Research suggests that several areas of the hypothalamus and hindbrain are especially important sites wherethis integration occurs (Ahima & Antwi, 2008; Woods & D\u2019Alessio, 2008). Ultimately, activity in the braindetermines whether or not we engage in feeding behavior (Figure 10.9)."

If our caloric intake exceedsour caloric use, our bodies store excess energy in the form of fat. If we consume fewer calories than we burnoff, then stored fat will be converted to energy. Our energy expenditure is obviously affected by our levels ofactivity, but our body\u2019s metabolic rate also comes into play. A person\u2019s metabolic rate is the amount of energythat is expended in a given period of time, and there is tremendous individual variability in our metabolicrates. People with high rates of metabolism are able to burn off calories more easily than those with lower ratesof metabolism.We all experience fluctuations in our weight from time to time, but generally, most people\u2019s weights fluctuatewithin a narrow margin, in the absence of extreme changes in diet and/or physical activity. This observationled some to propose a set-point theory of body weight regulation. The set-point theory asserts that eachindividual has an ideal body weight, or set point, which is resistant to change. This set-point is geneticallypredetermined and efforts to move our weight significantly from the set-point are resisted by compensatorychanges in energy intake and/or expenditure (Speakman et al., 2011).Some of the predictions generated from this particular theory have not received empirical support. Forexample, there are no changes in metabolic rate between individuals who had recently lost significantamounts of weight and a control group (Weinsier et al., 2000). In addition, the set-point theory fails to accountfor the influence of social and environmental factors in the regulation of body weight (Martin-Gronert &Ozanne, 2013; Speakman et al., 2011). Despite these limitations, set-point theory is still often used as a simple,intuitive explanation of how body weight is regulated.

People who are sooverweight that they are at risk for death are classified as morbidly obese. Morbid obesity is defined as havinga BMI over 40. Note that although BMI has been used as a healthy weight indicator by the World HealthOrganization (WHO), the CDC, and other groups, its value as an assessment tool has been questioned. The BMIis most useful for studying populations, which is the work of these organizations. It is less useful in assessingan individual since height and weight measurements fail to account for important factors like fitness level. Anathlete, for example, may have a high BMI because the tool doesn\u2019t distinguish between the body\u2019s percentageof fat and muscle in a person\u2019s weight.FIGURE 10.10 This chart shows how adult BMI is calculated. Individuals find their height on the y-axis and theirweight on the x-axis to determine their BMI.Being extremely overweight or obese is a risk factor for several negative health consequences. These include,but are not limited to, an increased risk for cardiovascular disease, stroke, Type 2 diabetes, liver disease, sleepapnea, colon cancer, breast cancer, infertility, and arthritis. Given that it is estimated that in the United Statesaround forty percent of the adult population is obese and that nearly three-quarters of adults and one in sixchildren qualify as overweight (CDC, 2018), there is substantial interest in trying to understand how to combatthis important public health concern.What causes someone to be overweight or obese? You have already read that both genes and environment areimportant factors for determining body weight, and if more calories are consumed than expended, excessenergy is stored as fat. However, socioeconomic status and the physical environment must also be consideredas contributing factors (CDC, 2012). For example, an individual who lives in a neighborhood with high crimerates and few food options may never feel comfortable walking or biking to work or to the local market. Thismight limit the amount of physical activity in which they engage. Similarly, some people may not be able toafford healthy food options from their market, or these options may be unavailable (especially in urban areasor poorer neighborhoods); therefore, some people must rely primarily on available, inexpensive, high fat, andhigh calorie fast food as their primary source of nutrition."

While some people are very successful with these approaches, many are not. In cases in which aperson has had no success with repeated attempts to reduce weight or is at risk for death because of obesity,bariatric surgery may be recommended. Bariatric surgery is a type of surgery specifically aimed at weightreduction, and it involves modifying the gastrointestinal system to reduce the amount of food that can be eatenand/or limiting how much of the digested food can be absorbed (Figure 10.11) (Mayo Clinic, 2013). A recentmeta-analysis suggests that bariatric surgery is more effective than non-surgical treatment for obesity in thetwo-years immediately following the procedure, but to date, no long-term studies yet exist (Gloy et al., 2013).FIGURE 10.11 Gastric banding surgery creates a small pouch of stomach, reducing the size of the stomach that canbe used for digestion.LINK TO LEARNINGWatch this video that describes two different types of bariatric surgeries (http://openstax.org/l/barsurgery) tolearn more.Prader-Willi SyndromePrader-Willi Syndrome (PWS) is a genetic disorder that results in persistent feelings of intense hunger andreduced rates of metabolism.

Atjust eight years old, she weighed approximately 120 pounds, and she was nicknamed \u201cLa Monstrua\u201d (themonster).While genetic testing can be used to make a diagnosis, there are a number of behavioral diagnostic criteriaassociated with PWS. From birth to 2 years of age, lack of muscle tone and poor sucking behavior may serve asearly signs of PWS. Developmental delays are seen between the ages of 6 and 12, and excessive eating andcognitive deficits associated with PWS usually onset a little later.While the exact mechanisms of PWS are not fully understood, there is evidence that affected individuals havehypothalamic abnormalities. This is not surprising, given the hypothalamus\u2019s role in regulating hunger and eating.However, as you will learn in the next section of this chapter, the hypothalamus is also involved in the regulationof sexual behavior. Consequently, many individuals suffering from PWS fail to reach sexual maturity duringadolescence.There is no current treatment or cure for PWS. However, if weight can be controlled in these individuals, thentheir life expectancies are significantly increased (historically, sufferers of PWS often died in adolescence or earlyadulthood). Advances in the use of various psychoactive medications and growth hormones continue to enhancethe quality of life for individuals with PWS (Cassidy & Driscoll, 2009; Prader-Willi Syndrome Association, 2012).Eating DisordersWhile nearly two out of three US adults struggle with issues related to being overweight, a smaller, butsignificant, portion of the population has eating disorders that typically result in being normal weight orunderweight. Often, these individuals are fearful of gaining weight. Individuals who have bulimia nervosa andanorexia nervosa face many adverse health consequences (Mayo Clinic, 2012a, 2012b).People suffering from bulimia nervosa engage in binge eating behavior that is followed by an attempt tocompensate for the large amount of food consumed. Purging the food by inducing vomiting or through the useof laxatives are two common compensatory behaviors. Some affected individuals engage in excessive amountsof exercise to compensate for their binges. Bulimia is associated with many adverse health consequences thatcan include kidney failure, heart failure, and tooth decay. In addition, these individuals often suffer fromanxiety and depression, and they are at an increased risk for substance abuse (Mayo Clinic, 2012b). The"

Unlike with bulimia, eating binges are notfollowed by inappropriate behavior, such as purging, but they are followed by distress, including feelings ofguilt and embarrassment. The resulting psychological distress distinguishes binge eating disorder fromovereating (American Psychiatric Association [APA], 2013).Anorexia nervosa is an eating disorder characterized by the maintenance of a body weight well below averagethrough starvation and/or excessive exercise. Individuals with anorexia nervosa often have a distorted bodyimage, referenced in literature as a type of body dysmorphia, meaning that they view themselves asoverweight even though they are not. Like bulimia nervosa, anorexia nervosa is associated with a number ofsignificant negative health outcomes: bone loss, heart failure, kidney failure, amenorrhea (cessation of themenstrual period), reduced function of the gonads, and in extreme cases, death. Furthermore, there is anincreased risk for a number of psychological problems, which include anxiety disorders, mood disorders, andsubstance abuse (Mayo Clinic, 2012a). Estimates of the prevalence of anorexia nervosa vary from study tostudy but generally range from just under one percent to just over four percent in women. Generally,prevalence rates are considerably lower for men (Smink et al., 2012).LINK TO LEARNINGWatch this news story about an Italian advertising campaign to raise public awareness of anorexia nervosa(http://openstax.org/l/anorexic) to learn more.While both anorexia and bulimia nervosa occur in people from many different cultures, White females fromWestern societies tend to be the most at-risk population. Recent research indicates that females between theages of 15 and 19 are most at risk, and it has long been suspected that these eating disorders are culturally-bound phenomena that are related to messages of a thin ideal often portrayed in popular media and thefashion world (Figure 10.13) (Smink et al., 2012). While social factors play an important role in thedevelopment of eating disorders, there is also evidence that genetic factors may predispose people to thesedisorders (Collier & Treasure, 2004).FIGURE 10.13 Young people in our society are inundated with images of extremely thin models (sometimesaccurately depicted and sometimes digitally altered to make them look even thinner).

From an evolutionary perspective, the reason isobvious\u2014perpetuation of the species. Sexual behavior in humans, however, involves much more thanreproduction. This section provides an overview of research that has been conducted on human sexualbehavior and motivation. This section will close with a discussion of issues related to gender identity andexpression and sexual orientation.Physiological Mechanisms of Sexual Behavior and MotivationMuch of what we know about the physiological mechanisms that underlie sexual behavior and motivationcomes from animal research. As you\u2019ve learned, the hypothalamus plays an important role in motivatedbehaviors, and sex is no exception. In fact, lesions to an area of the hypothalamus called the medial preopticarea completely disrupt a male rat\u2019s ability to engage in sexual behavior. Surprisingly, medial preoptic lesionsdo not change how hard a male rat is willing to work to gain access to a sexually receptive female (Figure10.14). This suggests that the ability to engage in sexual behavior and the motivation to do so may be mediatedby neural systems distinct from one another.FIGURE 10.14 A male rat that cannot engage in sexual behavior still seeks receptive females, suggesting that theability to engage in sexual behavior and the motivation to do so are mediated by different systems in the brain.(credit: Jason Snyder)Animal research suggests that limbic system structures such as the amygdala and nucleus accumbens areespecially important for sexual motivation. Damage to these areas results in a decreased motivation to engagein sexual behavior, while leaving the ability to do so intact (Figure 10.15) (Everett, 1990). Similar dissociationsof sexual motivation and sexual ability have also been observed in the female rat (Becker, Rudick, & Jenkins,2001; Jenkins & Becker, 2001)."

In contrast, the amygdala and nucleus accumbens are involved inmotivation for sexual behavior, but they do not affect the ability to engage in it.Although human sexual behavior is much more complex than that seen in rats, some parallels betweenanimals and humans can be drawn from this research. The worldwide popularity of drugs used to treat erectiledysfunction (Conrad, 2005) speaks to the fact that sexual motivation and the ability to engage in sexualbehavior can also be dissociated in humans. Moreover, disorders that involve abnormal hypothalamic functionare often associated with hypogonadism (reduced function of the gonads) and reduced sexual function (e.g.,Prader-Willi syndrome). Given the hypothalamus\u2019s role in endocrine function, it is not surprising thathormones secreted by the endocrine system also play important roles in sexual motivation and behavior. Forexample, many animals show no sign of sexual motivation in the absence of the appropriate combination ofsex hormones from their gonads. While this is not the case for humans, there is considerable evidence thatsexual motivation for all genders varies as a function of circulating testosterone levels (Bhasin, Enzlin,Coviello, & Basson, 2007; Carter, 1992; Sherwin, 1988).Kinsey\u2019s ResearchBefore the late 1940s, access to reliable, empirically-based information on sex was limited. Physicians wereconsidered authorities on all issues related to sex, despite the fact that they had little to no training in theseissues, and it is likely that most of what people knew about sex had been learned either through their ownexperiences or by talking with their peers. Convinced that people would benefit from a more open dialogue onissues related to human sexuality, Dr. Alfred Kinsey of Indiana University initiated large-scale survey researchon the topic (Figure 10.16). The results of some of these efforts were published in two books\u2014Sexual Behaviorin the Human Maleand Sexual Behavior in the Human Female\u2014which were published in 1948 and 1953,respectively (Bullough, 1998).FIGURE 10.16 In 1947, Alfred Kinsey established The Kinsey Institute for Research, Sex, Gender and Reproductionat Indiana University, shown here in 2011.

Never before had the American public seen its privatesexual behavior become the focus of scientific scrutiny on such a large scale. The books, which were filled withstatistics and scientific lingo, sold remarkably well to the general public, and people began to engage in openconversations about human sexuality. As you might imagine, not everyone was happy that this informationwas being published. In fact, these books were banned in some countries. Ultimately, the controversy resultedin Kinsey losing funding that he had secured from the Rockefeller Foundation to continue his research efforts(Bancroft, 2004).Although Kinsey\u2019s research has been widely criticized as being riddled with sampling and statistical errors(Jenkins, 2010), there is little doubt that this research was very influential in shaping future research onhuman sexual behavior and motivation. Kinsey described a remarkably diverse range of sexual behaviors andexperiences reported by the volunteers participating in his research. Behaviors that had once been consideredexceedingly rare or problematic were demonstrated to be much more common and innocuous than previouslyimagined (Bancroft, 2004; Bullough, 1998).LINK TO LEARNINGWatch this trailer for the 2004 film Kinseythat depicts Alfred Kinsey's life and research (http://openstax.org/l/Kinsey) to learn more.Among the results of Kinsey\u2019s research were the findings that women are as interested and experienced in sexas men, that both males and females masturbate without adverse health consequences, and that relationshipsand sexual acts between people of the same sex and/or the same gender are fairly common (Bancroft, 2004).Kinsey also developed a continuum known as the Kinsey scale that is still commonly used today to categorizean individual\u2019s sexual orientation, which is an individual\u2019s emotional, romantic, and erotic attractions to otherpeople or no people (Jenkins, 2010).Masters and Johnson\u2019s ResearchIn 1966, William Masters and Virginia Johnson published a book detailing the results of their observations ofnearly 700 people who agreed to participate in their study of physiological responses during sexual behavior.Unlike Kinsey, who used personal interviews and surveys to collect data, Masters and Johnson observedpeople having intercourse in a variety of positions, and they observed people masturbating, manually or withthe aid of a device. While this was occurring, researchers recorded measurements of physiological variables,such as blood pressure and respiration rate, as well as measurements of sexual arousal, such as vaginallubrication and penile tumescence (swelling associated with an erection). In total, Masters and Johnsonobserved nearly 10,000 sexual acts as a part of their research (Hock, 2008).Based on these observations, Masters and Johnson divided the sexual response cycle into four phases that arefairly similar in men and women: excitement, plateau, orgasm, and resolution (Figure 10.17). The excitementphase is the arousal phase of the sexual response cycle, and it is marked by erection of the penis or clitoris andlubrication and expansion of the vaginal canal. During plateau, the vagina swells further and blood flow to thelabia minora increases, and the penis becomes fully erect and may exhibit pre-ejaculatory fluid. Peopleexperience increases in muscle tone during this time. Orgasm is marked in females by rhythmic contractionsof the pelvis and uterus along with increased muscle tension. In males, pelvic contractions are accompaniedby a buildup of seminal fluid near the urethra that is ultimately forced out by contractions of genital muscles,(i.e., ejaculation). Resolution is the relatively rapid return to an unaroused state accompanied by a decrease inblood pressure and muscular relaxation. The refractory period is a period of time that follows an orgasmduring which an individual is incapable of experiencing another orgasm. The duration of the refractory periodcan vary dramatically from individual to individual with some refractory periods as short as several minutesand others as long as a day. As people age, their refractory periods tend to span longer periods of time."

Their research demonstrated the oft-cited statistic of the average size of a flaccid and an erect penis(3 and 6 inches, respectively) as well as dispelling long-held beliefs about relationships between the size of anerect penis and its ability to provide sexual pleasure to a partner. Furthermore, they determined that thevagina is a very elastic structure that can conform to penises of various sizes (Hock, 2008). In a similar mannerto Kinsey\u2019s work and other studies, Masters and Johnson\u2019s research has been criticized, built on, and in somecases proven wrong. The research represents an important element of the history of sexual research, and isnot viewed as entirely accurate today.Sexual OrientationAs mentioned earlier, a person\u2019s sexual orientation is their emotional, romantic, and erotic attraction towardother people or no people. While the majority of people identify as heterosexual, there is a sizable populationof people within the United States who identify as lesbian, gay, bisexual, pansexual, asexual, or other non-hetero sexualities. Bisexual people are attracted to people of their own gender and another gender; pansexualpeople experience attraction without regard to sex, gender identity or gender expression; asexual people donot experience sexual attraction or have little or no interest in sexual activity. Queer is an umbrella term usedto describe sexual orientation, gender identity, or gender expression. Other descriptive terms may not refer toa sexual attraction, but rather a romantic one. For example, an aromantic person does not experienceromantic attraction; this is different from asexuality, which refers to a lack of sexual attraction. And somesexual orientations do not refer to gender in their description (PFLAG, 2021). It is important to acknowledgeand understand that many of these orientations exist on on a spectrum, and there may be no specific term todescribe how an individual feels.Some of these terms have been associated in abbreviations such as LGBTQ (lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender,and queer or questioning). In some cases, people and organizations may add \"I\" to represent intersex people(described below), and \"A\" for asexual or aromantic people (or sometimes for \"allies\"), as well as one \"P\" todescribe pansexual people and sometimes another \"P\" to describe polysexual people. Finally, some people andorganizations add a plus sign (+) to represent other possible identities or orientations. Sexuality and genderterminology are constantly changing, and may mean different things to different people; they are notuniversal, and each individual defines them for themselves (UC Davis LGBTQIA Resource Center 2020)."

(credit: Till Krech)Issues of sexual orientation have long fascinated scientists interested in determining what causes oneindividual to be straight while another is gay. For many years, people believed that these differences arosebecause of different socialization and familial experiences. However, research has consistently demonstratedthat the family backgrounds and experiences are very similar among straight people and LGBTQ people (Bell,Weinberg, & Hammersmith, 1981; Ross & Arrindell, 1988).Genetic and biological mechanisms have also been proposed, and the balance of research evidence suggeststhat sexual orientation has an underlying biological component. For instance, over the past 25 years, researchhas demonstrated gene-level contributions to sexual orientation (Bailey & Pillard, 1991; Hamer, Hu,Magnuson, Hu, & Pattatucci, 1993; Rodriguez-Larralde & Paradisi, 2009), with some researchers estimatingthat genes account for at least half of the variability seen in human sexual orientation (Pillard & Bailey, 1998).Other studies report differences in brain structure and function among those with different sexualorientations (Allen & Gorski, 1992; Byne et al., 2001; Hu et al., 2008; LeVay, 1991; Ponseti et al., 2006; Rahman& Wilson, 2003a; Swaab & Hofman, 1990), and even differences in basic body structure and function havebeen observed (Hall & Kimura, 1994; Lippa, 2003; Loehlin & McFadden, 2003; McFadden & Champlin, 2000;McFadden & Pasanen, 1998; Rahman & Wilson, 2003b). In aggregate, the data suggest that to a significantextent, sexual orientations are something with which we are born.Misunderstandings About Sexual OrientationRegardless of how sexual orientation is determined, research has made clear that sexual orientation is not achoice, but rather it is a relatively stable characteristic of a person that cannot be changed. Claims of effectiveconversion therapy have received wide criticism from the research community due to significant concernswith research design, recruitment of experimental participants, and interpretation of data. As such, there is nocredible scientific evidence to suggest that individuals can change their sexual orientation (Jenkins, 2010).Dr. Robert Spitzer, the author of one of the most widely-cited examples of conversion therapy, apologized toboth the scientific community and the LGBTQ community for his mistakes, and he publically recanted his ownpaper in a public letter addressed to the editor of Archives of Sexual Behaviorin the spring of 2012 (Carey,2012). In this letter, Spitzer wrote,I was considering writing something that would acknowledge that I now judge the major critiques ofthe study as largely correct. . . .

In reality, these are two related, but different, aspects of who we are. Gender identityrefers to one\u2019s sense of being male, female, neither of these, both of these, or another gender. Generally, ourgender identities correspond to our chromosomal and phenotypic sex, but this is not always the case.Transgender people\u2019s gender identity differs from the sex they were assigned at birth. Transgender peoplemay use a range of terms to describe themselves, including abbreviations (e.g. trans) or terms such as non-binary.When individuals do not feel comfortable identifying with the gender associated with their biological sex, thenthey may experience gender dysphoria. Gender dysphoria is a diagnostic category in the fifth edition of theDiagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders(DSM-5) that describes individuals who do not identifyas the gender that most people would assume they are. This dysphoria must persist for at least six months andresult in significant distress or dysfunction to meet DSM-5 diagnostic criteria. In order for children to beassigned this diagnostic category, they must verbalize their desire to become the other gender. It is importantto note that not all transgender people experience gender dysphoria, and that its diagnostic categorization isnot universally accepted. For example, in 2019, the World Health Organization reclassified \u201cgender identitydisorder\u201d as \u201cgender incongruence,\u201d and categorized it under sexual health rather than a mental disorder.However, health and mental health professionals indicate that the presence of the diagnostic category doesassist in supporting those who need treatment or help.Some transgender individuals may undertake a process of transition, in which they move from living in a waythat is more aligned with the sex assigned at birth to living in a way that is aligned with their gender identity.Transitioning may take the form of social, legal, or medical aspects of someone's life, but not everyoneundertakes any or all types of transition. Social transition may involve the person's presentation, name,pronouns, and relationships. Legal transition can include changing their gender on government or otherofficial documents, changing their legal name, and so on. Some people may undergo a physical or medicaltransition, in which they change their outward, physical, or sexual characteristics in order for their physicalbeing to better align with their gender identity (UCSF Transgender Care 2019). Not all transgender individualschoose to alter their bodies: many will maintain their original anatomy but may present themselves to societyas another gender. This is typically done by adopting the dress, hairstyle, mannerisms, or other characteristicstypically assigned to another gender. It is important to note that people who cross-dress, or wear clothing thatis traditionally assigned to a gender different from their biological sex, are not necessarily transgender. Cross-dressing is typically a form of self-expression or personal style, and it does not indicate a person's genderidentity or that they are transgender (TSER 2021).Intersex is a general term used to describe people whose sex traits, reproductive anatomy, hormones, orchromosomes are different from the usual two ways human bodies develop. Some intersex traits arerecognized at birth, while others are not recognizable until puberty or later in life (interACT 2021). Intersex"

As with transgender people, the term or usage of cisgender does not indicate aperson's sexual orientation, gender, or gender expression (TSER 2021).Our scientific knowledge and general understanding about gender identity continue to evolve, and youngpeople today have more opportunity to explore and openly express different ideas about what gender meansthan previous generations. Recent studies indicate that the majority of millennials (those ages 18\u201334) regardgender as a spectrum instead of a strict male/female binary, and that 12% identify as transgender or gendernon-conforming. Additionally, more people know others who use gender-neutral pronouns (such as they/them) (Kennedy, 2017). This change in language may indicate that millennials and Generation Z peopleunderstand the experience of gender itself differently. As young people lead this change, other changes areemerging in a range of spheres, from public bathroom policies to retail organizations. For example, someretailers are starting to change traditional gender-based marketing of products, such as removing \u201cpink andblue\u201d clothing and toy aisles. Even with these changes, those who exist outside of traditional gender norms facedifficult challenges. Even people who vary slightly from traditional norms are often the target of discriminationand violence.FIGURE 10.19 Actress Laverne Cox, who is openly transgender, is the first transgender actress to portray atransgender character on a regular television series.

We have tended to classify anindividual as either male or female according to the sex they were assigned at birth, leading the United Statesto be considered a cisnormative society. However, in some cultures there are additional gender variantsresulting in more than two gender categories. For example, in Thailand, you can be male, female, or kathoey.

Distraught, Janet and Ronaldlooked to expert advice on what to do with their baby boy. By happenstance, the couple became aware of Dr.John Money at Johns Hopkins University and his theory of psychosexual neutrality (Colapinto, 2000).Dr. Money had spent a considerable amount of time researching transgender individuals and individuals bornwith ambiguous genitalia. As a result of this work, he developed a theory of psychosexual neutrality. His theoryasserted that we are essentially neutral at birth with regard to our gender identity and that we don\u2019t assume aconcrete gender identity until we begin to master language. Furthermore, Dr. Money believed that the way inwhich we are socialized in early life is ultimately much more important than our biology in determining ourgender identity (Money, 1962).Dr. Money encouraged Janet and Ronald to bring the twins to Johns Hopkins University, and he convinced themthat they should raise Bruce as a girl. Left with few other options at the time, Janet and Ronald agreed to haveBruce\u2019s testicles removed and to raise him as a girl. When they returned home to Canada, they brought with themBrian and his \u201csister,\u201d Brenda, along with specific instructions to never reveal to Brenda that she had been born aboy (Colapinto, 2000).Early on, Dr. Money shared with the scientific community the great success of this natural experiment thatseemed to fully support his theory of psychosexual neutrality (Money, 1975). Indeed, in early interviews with thechildren it appeared that Brenda was a typical little girl who liked to play with \u201cgirly\u201d toys and do \u201cgirly\u201d things.However, Dr. Money was less than forthcoming with information that seemed to argue against the success of thecase. In reality, Brenda\u2019s parents were constantly concerned that their little girl wasn\u2019t really behaving as mostgirls did, and by the time Brenda was nearing adolescence, it was painfully obvious to the family that she wasreally having a hard time identifying as a female. In addition, Brenda was becoming increasingly reluctant tocontinue her visits with Dr. Money to the point that she threatened suicide if her parents made her go back to seehim again.At that point, Janet and Ronald disclosed the true nature of Brenda\u2019s early childhood to their daughter. Whileinitially shocked, Brenda reported that things made sense to her now, and ultimately, by the time she was anadolescent, Brenda had decided to identify as a male. Thus, she became David Reimer.David was quite comfortable in his masculine role. He made new friends and began to think about his future.Although his castration had left him infertile, he still wanted to be a father. In 1990, David married a single"

This promptedDavid and his brother to go public with their experiences in attempt to discredit the doctor\u2019s publications. Whilethis revelation created a firestorm in the scientific community for Dr. Money, it also triggered a series ofunfortunate events that ultimately led to David dying by suicide in 2004 (O\u2019Connell, 2004).This sad story speaks to the complexities involved in gender identity. While the Reimer case had earlier beenparaded as a hallmark of how socialization trumped biology in terms of gender identity, the truth of the storymade the scientific and medical communities more cautious in dealing with cases that involve intersex childrenand how to deal with their unique circumstances. In fact, stories like this one have prompted measures toprevent unnecessary harm and suffering to children who might have issues with gender identity. For example, in2013, a law took effect in Germany allowing parents of intersex children to classify their children asindeterminate so that children can self-assign the appropriate gender once they have fully developed their owngender identities (Paramaguru, 2013).LINK TO LEARNINGWatch this news story about the experiences of David Reimer and his family (http://openstax.org/l/reimer) tolearn more."

An emotion is a subjective state ofbeing that we often describe as our feelings. Emotions result from the combination of subjective experience,expression, cognitive appraisal, and physiological responses (Levenson, Carstensen, Friesen, & Ekman, 1991).However, as discussed later in the chapter, the exact order in which the components occur is not clear, andsome parts may happen at the same time. An emotion often begins with a subjective (individual) experience,which is a stimulus. Often the stimulus is external, but it does not have to be from the outside world. Forexample, it might be that one thinks about war and becomes sad, even though they never experienced war.Emotional expression refers to the way one displays an emotion and includes nonverbal and verbal behaviors(Gross, 1999). One also performs a cognitive appraisal in which a person tries to determine the way they will beimpacted by a situation (Roseman & Smith, 2001). In addition, emotions include physiological responses, suchas possible changes in heart rate, sweating, etc. (Soussignan, 2002).The words emotion and mood are sometimes used interchangeably, but psychologists use these words to referto two different things. Typically, the word emotion indicates a subjective, affective state that is relativelyintense and that occurs in response to something we experience (Figure 10.20). Emotions are often thought tobe consciously experienced and intentional. Mood, on the other hand, refers to a prolonged, less intense,affective state that does not occur in response to something we experience. Mood states may not beconsciously recognized and do not carry the intentionality that is associated with emotion (Beedie, Terry, Lane,& Devonport, 2011). Here we will focus on emotion, and you will learn more about mood in the chapter thatcovers psychological disorders."

This section closes with a discussion of the ubiquitous nature of facial expressions ofemotion and our abilities to recognize those expressions in others.Theories of EmotionOur emotional states are combinations of physiological arousal, psychological appraisal, and subjectiveexperiences. Together, these are the components of emotion, and our experiences, backgrounds, and culturesinform our emotions. Therefore, different people may have different emotional experiences even when facedwith similar circumstances. Over time, several different theories of emotion, shown in Figure 10.21, have beenproposed to explain how the various components of emotion interact with one another."

Recall what youhave learned about the sympathetic nervous system and our fight or flight response when threatened. If youwere to encounter some threat in your environment, like a venomous snake in your backyard, yoursympathetic nervous system would initiate significant physiological arousal, which would make your heartrace and increase your respiration rate.

Furthermore, different arousalpatterns would be associated with different feelings.Other theorists, however, doubted that the physiological arousal that occurs with different types of emotions is"

According to this view, physiological arousal and emotional experience occursimultaneously, yet independently (Lang, 1994). So, when you see the venomous snake, you feel fear at exactlythe same time that your body mounts its fight or flight response. This emotional reaction would be separateand independent of the physiological arousal, even though they co-occur.Does smiling make you happy? Alternatively, does being happy make you smile? The facial feedbackhypothesis proposes that your facial expression can actually affect your emotional experience (Adelman &Zajonc, 1989; Boiger & Mesquita, 2012; Buck, 1980; Capella, 1993; Soussignan, 2001). Research investigatingthe facial feedback hypothesis suggested that suppression of facial expression of emotion lowered theintensity of some emotions experienced by participants (Davis, Senghas, & Ochsner, 2009). Havas, Glenberg,Gutowski, Lucarelli, and Davidson (2010) used Botox injections to paralyze facial muscles and limit facialexpressions, including frowning, and they found that depressed people reported less depression after theirfrowning muscles were paralyzed. Other research found that the intensities of facial expressions affected theemotional reactions (Soussignan, 2002). In other words, if something insignificant occurs and you smile as ifyou just won lottery, you will actually be happier about the little thing than you would be if you only had a tinysmile. Conversely, if you walk around frowning all the time, it might cause you to have less positive emotionsthan you would if you had smiled. Interestingly, Soussignan (2002) also reported physiological arousaldifferences associated with the intensities of one type of smile.G. Mara\u00f1on Posadillo was a Spanish physician who studied the psychological effects of adrenaline to create amodel for the experience of emotion. Mara\u00f1on's model preceded Schachter's two-factor or arousal-cognitiontheory of emotion (Cornelius, 1991). The Schachter-Singer two-factor theory of emotion is another variationon theories of emotions that takes into account both physiological arousal and the emotional experience.According to this theory, emotions are composed of two factors: physiological and cognitive. In other words,physiological arousal is interpreted in context to produce the emotional experience. In revisiting our exampleinvolving the venomous snake in your backyard, the two-factor theory maintains that the snake elicitssympathetic nervous system activation that is labeled as fear given the context, and our experience is that offear. If you had labeled your sympathetic nervous system activation as joy, you would have experienced joy.The Schachter-Singer two-factor theory depends on labeling the physiological experience, which is a type ofcognitive appraisal.Magda Arnold was the first theorist to offer an exploration of the meaning of appraisal, and to present anoutline of what the appraisal process might be and how it relates to emotion (Roseman & Smith, 2001). The keyidea of appraisal theory is that you have thoughts (a cognitive appraisal) before you experience an emotion,and the emotion you experience depends on the thoughts you had (Frijda, 1988; Lazarus, 1991). If you thinksomething is positive, you will have more positive emotions about it than if your appraisal was negative, andthe opposite is true. Appraisal theory explains the way two people can have two completely different emotionsregarding the same event. For example, suppose your psychology instructor selected you to lecture onemotion; you might see that as positive, because it represents an opportunity to be the center of attention, andyou would experience happiness. However, if you dislike speaking in public, you could have a negativeappraisal and experience discomfort.Schachter and Singer believed that physiological arousal is very similar across the different types of emotionsthat we experience, and therefore, the cognitive appraisal of the situation is critical to the actual emotionexperienced. In fact, it might be possible to misattribute arousal to an emotional experience if thecircumstances were right (Schachter & Singer, 1962). They performed a clever experiment to test their idea. Agroup of men participating in the experiment were randomly assigned to one of several groups. Some of theparticipants received injections of epinephrine that caused bodily changes that mimicked the fight-or-flightresponse of the sympathetic nervous system; however, only some of these men were told to expect thesereactions as side effects of the injection. The other men that received injections of epinephrine were told eitherthat the injection would have no side effects or that it would result in a side effect unrelated to a sympathetic"

After receiving these injections, participants waited in a room withsomeone else they thought was another subject in the research project. In reality, the other person was aconfederate (someone working on behalf of) of the researcher. The confederate engaged in scripted displays ofeuphoric or angry behavior (Schachter & Singer, 1962).When those participants who were told that they should expect to feel symptoms of physiological arousal wereasked about any emotional changes that they had experienced related to either euphoria or anger (dependingon the way the confederate behaved), they reported none. However, the men who weren\u2019t expectingphysiological arousal as a function of the injection were more likely to report that they experienced euphoriaor anger as a function of their assigned confederate\u2019s behavior. While everyone who received an injection ofepinephrine experienced the same physiological arousal, only those who were not expecting the arousal usedcontext to interpret the arousal as a change in emotional state (Schachter & Singer, 1962).Strong emotional responses are associated with strong physiological arousal, which caused some theorists tosuggest that the signs of physiological arousal, including increased heart rate, respiration rate, and sweating,might be used to determine whether someone is telling the truth or not. The assumption is that most of uswould show signs of physiological arousal if we were being dishonest with someone. A polygraph, or liedetector test, measures the physiological arousal of an individual responding to a series of questions. Someonetrained in reading these tests would look for answers to questions that are associated with increased levels ofarousal as potential signs that the respondent may have been dishonest on those answers. While polygraphsare still commonly used, their validity and accuracy are highly questionable because there is no evidence thatlying is associated with any particular pattern of physiological arousal (Saxe & Ben-Shakhar, 1999).The relationship between our experiencing of emotions and our cognitive processing of them, and the order inwhich these occur, remains a topic of research and debate. Lazarus (1991) developed the cognitive-mediational theory that asserts our emotions are determined by our appraisal of the stimulus. This appraisalmediates between the stimulus and the emotional response, and it is immediate and often unconscious. Incontrast to the Schachter-Singer model, the appraisal precedes a cognitive label. You will learn more aboutLazarus\u2019s appraisal concept when you study stress, health, and lifestyle. However, there are other views ofemotions that also emphasize the cognitive processes.Return to the example of being asked to lecture by your professor. Even if you do not enjoy speaking in public,you probably could manage to do it. You would purposefully control your emotions, which would allow you tospeak, but we constantly regulate our emotions, and much of our emotion regulation occurs without usactively thinking about it. Mauss and her colleagues studied automatic emotion regulation (AER), which refersto the non-deliberate control of emotions. It is simply not reacting with your emotions, and AER can affect allaspects of emotional processes. AER can influence the things you attend to, your appraisal, your choice toengage in an emotional experience, and your behaviors after an emotion is experienced (Mauss, Bunge, &Gross, 2007; Mauss, Levenson, McCarter, Wilhelm, & Gross, 2005). AER is similar to other automatic cognitiveprocesses in which sensations activate knowledge structures that affect functioning. These knowledgestructures can include concepts, schemas, or scripts.The idea of AER is that people develop an automatic process that works like a script or schema, and theprocess does not require deliberate thought to regulate emotions. AER works like riding a bicycle. Once youdevelop the process, you just do it without thinking about it. AER can be adaptive or maladaptive and hasimportant health implications (Hopp, Troy, & Mauss, 2011). Adaptive AER leads to better health outcomes thanmaladaptive AER, primarily due to experiencing or mitigating stressors better than people with maladaptiveAERs (Hopp, Troy, & Mauss, 2011). Alternatively, maladaptive AERs may be critical for maintaining somepsychological disorders (Hopp, Troy, & Mauss, 2011). Mauss and her colleagues found that strategies couldreduce negative emotions, which in turn should increase psychological health (Mauss, Cook, Cheng, & Gross,2007; Mauss, Cook, & Gross, 2007; Shallcross, Troy, Boland, & Mauss, 2010; Troy, Shallcross, & Mauss, 2013;Troy, Wilhelm, Shallcross, & Mauss, 2010).

However, another way of considering emotionschallenges our entire understanding of emotions.After about three decades of interdisciplinary research, Barrett argued that we do not understand emotions.She proposed that emotions were not built into your brain at birth, but rather they were constructed based onyour experiences. Emotions in the constructivist theory are predictions that construct your experience of theworld. In chapter 7 you learned that concepts are categories or groupings of linguistic information, images,ideas, or memories, such as life experiences. Barrett extended that to include emotions as concepts that arepredictions (Barrett, 2017). Two identical physiological states can result in different emotional statesdepending on your predictions. For example, your brain predicting a churning stomach in a bakery could leadto you constructing hunger. However, your brain predicting a churning stomach while you were waiting formedical test results could lead your brain to construct worry. Thus, you can construct two different emotionsfrom the same physiological sensations. Rather than emotions being something over which you have nocontrol, you can control and influence your emotions.LINK TO LEARNINGWatch this video in which Dr. Barrett explains constructed emotions (http://openstax.org/l/barrett) to learnmore.Two other prominent views arise from the work of Robert Zajonc and Joseph LeDoux. Zajonc asserted thatsome emotions occur separately from or prior to our cognitive interpretation of them, such as feeling fear inresponse to an unexpected loud sound (Zajonc, 1998). He also believed in what we might casually refer to as agut feeling\u2014that we can experience an instantaneous and unexplainable like or dislike for someone orsomething (Zajonc, 1980). LeDoux also views some emotions as requiring no cognition: some emotionscompletely bypass contextual interpretation. His research into the neuroscience of emotion has demonstratedthe amygdala\u2019s primary role in fear (Cunha, Monfils, & LeDoux, 2010; LeDoux 1996, 2002). A fear stimulus isprocessed by the brain through one of two paths: from the thalamus (where it is perceived) directly to theamygdala or from the thalamus through the cortex and then to the amygdala. The first path is quick, while thesecond enables more processing about details of the stimulus. In the following section, we will look moreclosely at the neuroscience of emotional response.The Biology of EmotionsEarlier, you learned about the limbic system, which is the area of the brain involved in emotion and memory(Figure 10.22). The limbic system includes the hypothalamus, thalamus, amygdala, and the hippocampus. Thehypothalamus plays a role in the activation of the sympathetic nervous system that is a part of any givenemotional reaction. The thalamus serves as a sensory relay center whose neurons project to both the amygdalaand the higher cortical regions for further processing. The amygdala plays a role in processing emotionalinformation and sending that information on (Fossati, 2012).The hippocampus integrates emotionalexperience with cognition (Femen\u00eda, G\u00f3mez-Gal\u00e1n, Lindskog, & Magara, 2012)."

The amygdala is composed of various subnuclei, including the basolateralcomplex and the central nucleus (Figure 10.23). The basolateral complex has dense connections with avariety of sensory areas of the brain. It is critical for classical conditioning and for attaching emotional value tolearning processes and memory. The central nucleus plays a role in attention, and it has connections with thehypothalamus and various brainstem areas to regulate the autonomic nervous and endocrine systems\u2019 activity(Pessoa, 2010)."

This leads to an aversion to the odor cuethat suggests the rats learned to fear the odor cue. Interestingly, when the mother was present, the rats actuallyshowed a preference for the odor cue despite its association with an electrical shock. This preference wasassociated with no increases in amygdala activation. This suggests a differential effect on the amygdala by thecontext(the presence or absence of the mother) determined whether the pups learned to fear the odor or to beattracted to it (Moriceau & Sullivan, 2006).Raineki, Cort\u00e9s, Belnoue, and Sullivan (2012) demonstrated that, in rats, negative early life experiences couldalter the function of the amygdala and result in adolescent patterns of behavior that mimic human mooddisorders. In this study, rat pups received either abusive or normal treatment during postnatal days 8\u201312.There were two forms of abusive treatment. The first form of abusive treatment had an insufficient beddingcondition. The mother rat had insufficient bedding material in her cage to build a proper nest that resulted inher spending more time away from her pups trying to construct a nest and less times nursing her pups. Thesecond form of abusive treatment had an associative learning task that involved pairing odors and an electricalstimulus in the absence of the mother, as described above. The control group was in a cage with sufficientbedding and was left undisturbed with their mothers during the same time period. The rat pups thatexperienced abuse were much more likely to exhibit depressive-like symptoms during adolescence whencompared to controls. These depressive-like behaviors were associated with increased activation of theamygdala.Human research also suggests a relationship between the amygdala and psychological disorders of mood oranxiety. Changes in amygdala structure and function have been demonstrated in adolescents who are eitherat-risk or have been diagnosed with various mood and/or anxiety disorders (Miguel-Hidalgo, 2013; Qin et al.,2013). It has also been suggested that functional differences in the amygdala could serve as a biomarker todifferentiate individuals suffering from bipolar disorder from those suffering from major depressive disorder(Fournier, Keener, Almeida, Kronhaus, & Phillips, 2013).HippocampusAs mentioned earlier, the hippocampus is also involved in emotional processing.

Individuals suffering from posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) show marked reductions in thevolume of several parts of the hippocampus, which may result from decreased levels of neurogenesis anddendritic branching (the generation of new neurons and the generation of new dendrites in existing neurons,respectively) (Wang et al., 2010). While it is impossible to make a causal claim with correlational research likethis, studies have demonstrated behavioral improvements and hippocampal volume increases following eitherpharmacological or cognitive-behavioral therapy in individuals suffering from PTSD (Bremner & Vermetten,2004; Levy-Gigi, Szab\u00f3, Kelemen, & K\u00e9ri, 2013).Facial Expression and Recognition of EmotionsCulture can impact the way in which people display emotion. A cultural display rule is one of a collection ofculturally specific standards that govern the types and frequencies of displays of emotions that are acceptable(Malatesta & Haviland, 1982). Therefore, people from varying cultural backgrounds can have very differentcultural display rules of emotion. For example, research has shown that individuals from the United Statesexpress negative emotions like fear, anger, and disgust both alone and in the presence of others, whileJapanese individuals only do so while alone (Matsumoto, 1990). Furthermore, individuals from cultures thattend to emphasize social cohesion are more likely to engage in suppression of emotional reaction so they canevaluate which response is most appropriate in a given context (Matsumoto, Yoo, & Nakagawa, 2008).Other distinct cultural characteristics might be involved in emotionality. For instance, there may be genderdifferences involved in emotional processing. While research into gender differences in emotional display isequivocal, there is some evidence that people of different genders may differ in regulation of emotions (McRae,Ochsner, Mauss, Gabrieli, & Gross, 2008).Paul Ekman (1972) researched a New Guinea man who was living in a preliterate culture using stoneimplements, and which was isolated and had never seen any outsiders before. Ekman asked the man to showwhat his facial expression would be if: (1) friends visited, (2) his child had just died, (3) he was about to fight,(4) he stepped on a smelly dead pig. After Ekman\u2019s return from New Guinea, he researched facial expressionsfor more than four decades. Despite different emotional display rules, our ability to recognize and producefacial expressions of emotion appears to be universal. In fact, even congenitally blind individuals produce thesame facial expression of emotions, despite their never having the opportunity to observe these facial displaysof emotion in other people. This would seem to suggest that the pattern of activity in facial muscles involved ingenerating emotional expressions is universal, and indeed, this idea was suggested in the late 19th century inCharles Darwin\u2019s book The Expression of Emotions in Man and Animals(1872).In fact, there is substantialevidence for seven universal emotions that are each associated with distinct facial expressions. These include:happiness, surprise, sadness, fright, disgust, contempt, and anger (Figure 10.24) (Ekman & Keltner, 1997)."

Children who have autism spectrum disorders have difficulty recognizing theemotional states of others, and research has shown that this may stem from an inability to distinguish variousnonverbal expressions of emotion (i.e., facial expressions) from one another (Hobson, 1986). In addition, there isevidence to suggest that autistic individuals also have difficulty expressing emotion through tone of voice and byproducing facial expressions (Macdonald et al., 1989). Difficulties with emotional recognition and expression maycontribute to the behaviors that characterize autism; therefore, various therapeutic approaches have been exploredto address these difficulties. Various educational curricula, cognitive-behavioral therapies, and pharmacologicaltherapies have shown some promise in helping autistic individuals process emotionally relevant information(Bauminger, 2002; Golan & Baron-Cohen, 2006; Guastella et al., 2010).Emotion regulation describes how people respond to situations and experiences by modifying their emotional"

Our personality is what makes us unique individuals. Each person has anidiosyncratic pattern of enduring, long-term characteristics and a manner in which they interact with otherindividuals and the world around them. Our personalities are thought to be long term, stable, and not easilychanged. The word personalitycomes from the Latin word persona. In the ancient world, a persona was amask worn by an actor. While we tend to think of a mask as being worn to conceal one\u2019s identity, the theatricalmask was originally used to either represent or project a specific personality trait of a character (Figure 11.2).FIGURE 11.2 Happy, sad, impatient, shy, fearful, curious, helpful. What characteristics describe your personality?Historical PerspectivesThe concept of personality has been studied for at least 2,000 years, beginning with Hippocrates in 370 BCE(Fazeli, 2012). Hippocrates theorized that personality traits and human behaviors are based on four separatetemperaments associated with four fluids (\u201chumors\u201d) of the body: choleric temperament (yellow bile from theliver), melancholic temperament (black bile from the kidneys), sanguine temperament (red blood from theheart), and phlegmatic temperament (white phlegm from the lungs) (Clark & Watson, 2008; Eysenck &Eysenck, 1985; Lecci & Magnavita, 2013; Noga, 2007). Centuries later, the influential Greek physician andphilosopher Galen built on Hippocrates\u2019s theory, suggesting that both diseases and personality differencescould be explained by imbalances in the humors and that each person exhibits one of the four temperaments.For example, the choleric person is passionate, ambitious, and bold; the melancholic person is reserved,anxious, and unhappy; the sanguine person is joyful, eager, and optimistic; and the phlegmatic person is calm,reliable, and thoughtful (Clark & Watson, 2008; Stelmack & Stalikas, 1991). Galen\u2019s theory was prevalent forover 1,000 years and continued to be popular through the Middle Ages.In 1780, Franz Gall, a German physician, proposed that the distances between bumps on the skull reveal aperson\u2019s personality traits, character, and mental abilities (Figure 11.3). According to Gall, measuring thesedistances revealed the sizes of the brain areas underneath, providing information that could be used todetermine whether a person was friendly, prideful, murderous, kind, good with languages, and so on. Initially,phrenology was very popular; however, it was soon discredited for lack of empirical support and has long beenrelegated to the status of pseudoscience (Fancher, 1979)."

(b) An 1825 lithograph depicts Gall examining the skull of a young woman. (creditb: modification of work by Wellcome Library, London)In the centuries after Galen, other researchers contributed to the development of his four primarytemperament types, most prominently Immanuel Kant (in the 18th century) and psychologist Wilhelm Wundt(in the 19th century) (Eysenck, 2009; Stelmack & Stalikas, 1991; Wundt, 1874/1886) (Figure 11.4). Kant agreedwith Galen that everyone could be sorted into one of the four temperaments and that there was no overlapbetween the four categories (Eysenck, 2009). He developed a list of traits that could be used to describe thepersonality of a person from each of the four temperaments. However, Wundt suggested that a betterdescription of personality could be achieved using two major axes: emotional/nonemotional and changeable/unchangeable. The first axis separated strong from weak emotions (the melancholic and cholerictemperaments from the phlegmatic and sanguine). The second axis divided the changeable temperaments(choleric and sanguine) from the unchangeable ones (melancholic and phlegmatic) (Eysenck, 2009)."

According to Freud, unconscious drivesinfluenced by sex and aggression, along with childhood sexuality, are the forces that influence our personality.Freud attracted many followers who modified his ideas to create new theories about personality. Thesetheorists, referred to as neo-Freudians, generally agreed with Freud that childhood experiences matter, butthey reduced the emphasis on sex and focused more on the social environment and effects of culture onpersonality. The perspective of personality proposed by Freud and his followers was the dominant theory ofpersonality for the first half of the 20th century.Other major theories then emerged, including the learning, humanistic, biological, evolutionary, trait, andcultural perspectives.

However, Freud was the first to systematicallystudy and theorize the workings of the unconscious mind in the manner that we associate with modernpsychology.In the early years of his career, Freud worked with Josef Breuer, a Viennese physician. During this time, Freudbecame intrigued by the story of one of Breuer\u2019s patients, Bertha Pappenheim, who was referred to by thepseudonym Anna O. (Launer, 2005). Anna O. had been caring for her dying father when she began toexperience symptoms such as partial paralysis, headaches, blurred vision, amnesia, and hallucinations(Launer, 2005). In Freud\u2019s day, these symptoms were commonly referred to as hysteria. Anna O. turned toBreuer for help. He spent 2 years (1880\u20131882) treating Anna O. and discovered that allowing her to talk abouther experiences seemed to bring some relief of her symptoms. Anna O. called his treatment the \u201ctalking cure\u201d(Launer, 2005). Despite the fact that Freud never met Anna O., her story served as the basis for the 1895 book,Studies on Hysteria, which he co-authored with Breuer. Based on Breuer\u2019s description of Anna O.\u2019s treatment,Freud concluded that hysteria was the result of sexual abuse in childhood and that these traumaticexperiences had been hidden from consciousness. Breuer disagreed with Freud, which soon ended their worktogether. However, Freud continued to work to refine talk therapy and build his theory on personality.Levels of ConsciousnessTo explain the concept of conscious versus unconscious experience, Freud compared the mind to an iceberg(Figure 11.5). He said that only about one-tenth of our mind is conscious, and the rest of our mind isunconscious. Our unconscious refers to that mental activity of which we are unaware and are unable to access(Freud, 1923). According to Freud, unacceptable urges and desires are kept in our unconscious through aprocess called repression. For example, we sometimes say things that we don\u2019t intend to say by unintentionallysubstituting another word for the one we meant. You\u2019ve probably heard of a Freudian slip, the term used todescribe this. Freud suggested that slips of the tongue are actually sexual or aggressive urges, accidentallyslipping out of our unconscious. Speech errors such as this are quite common. Seeing them as a reflection ofunconscious desires, linguists today have found that slips of the tongue tend to occur when we are tired,nervous, or not at our optimal level of cognitive functioning (Motley, 2002).FIGURE 11.5 Freud believed that we are only aware of a small amount of our mind\u2019s activities and that most of it"

The information in our unconscious affects our behavior, although weare unaware of it.According to Freud, our personality develops from a conflict between two forces: our biological aggressive andpleasure-seeking drives versus our internal (socialized) control over these drives. Our personality is the resultof our efforts to balance these two competing forces. Freud suggested that we can understand this byimagining three interacting systems within our minds. He called them the id, ego, and superego (Figure 11.6).FIGURE 11.6 The job of the ego, or self, is to balance the aggressive/pleasure-seeking drives of the id with themoral control of the superego.The unconscious id contains our most primitive drives or urges, and is present from birth. It directs impulsesfor hunger, thirst, and sex. Freud believed that the id operates on what he called the \u201cpleasure principle,\u201d inwhich the id seeks immediate gratification. Through social interactions with parents and others in a child\u2019senvironment, the ego and superego develop to help control the id. The superego develops as a child interactswith others, learning the social rules for right and wrong. The superego acts as our conscience; it is our moralcompass that tells us how we should behave. It strives for perfection and judges our behavior, leading tofeelings of pride or\u2014when we fall short of the ideal\u2014feelings of guilt. In contrast to the instinctual id and therule-based superego, the ego is the rational part of our personality. It\u2019s what Freud considered to be the self,and it is the part of our personality that is seen by others. Its job is to balance the demands of the id andsuperego in the context of reality; thus, it operates on what Freud called the \u201creality principle.\u201d The ego helpsthe id satisfy its desires in a realistic way.The id and superego are in constant conflict, because the id wants instant gratification regardless of theconsequences, but the superego tells us that we must behave in socially acceptable ways. Thus, the ego\u2019s job isto find the middle ground. It helps satisfy the id\u2019s desires in a rational way that will not lead us to feelings ofguilt. According to Freud, a person who has a strong ego, which can balance the demands of the id and thesuperego, has a healthy personality. Freud maintained that imbalances in the system can lead to neurosis (atendency to experience negative emotions), anxiety disorders, or unhealthy behaviors. For example, a personwho is dominated by their id might be narcissistic and impulsive. A person with a dominant superego might becontrolled by feelings of guilt and deny themselves even socially acceptable pleasures; conversely, if thesuperego is weak or absent, a person might become a psychopath. An overly dominant superego might be seenin an over-controlled individual whose rational grasp on reality is so strong that they are unaware of theiremotional needs, or, in a neurotic who is overly defensive (overusing ego defense mechanisms).Defense MechanismsFreud believed that feelings of anxiety result from the ego\u2019s inability to mediate the conflict between the id andsuperego. When this happens, Freud believed that the ego seeks to restore balance through various protectivemeasures known as defense mechanisms (Figure 11.7). When certain events, feelings, or yearnings cause anindividual anxiety, the individual wishes to reduce that anxiety. To do that, the individual\u2019s unconscious minduses ego defense mechanisms, unconscious protective behaviors that aim to reduce anxiety. The ego, usually"

The idea that he might be gaycauses Joe to have feelings of anxiety. How can he decrease his anxiety? Joe may find himself acting very\u201cmacho,\u201d making gay jokes, and picking on a school peer who is gay. This way, Joe\u2019s unconscious impulses arefurther submerged.There are several different types of defense mechanisms. For instance, in repression, anxiety-causingmemories from consciousness are blocked. As an analogy, let\u2019s say your car is making a strange noise, butbecause you do not have the money to get it fixed, you just turn up the radio so that you no longer hear thestrange noise. Eventually you forget about it. Similarly, in the human psyche, if a memory is too overwhelmingto deal with, it might be repressed and thus removed from conscious awareness (Freud, 1920). This repressedmemory might cause symptoms in other areas.Another defense mechanism is reaction formation, in which someone expresses feelings, thoughts, andbehaviors opposite to their inclinations. In the above example, Joe made fun of a gay peer while himself beingattracted to males. In regression, an individual acts much younger than their age. For example, a four-year-oldchild who resents the arrival of a newborn sibling may act like a baby and revert to drinking out of a bottle. Inprojection, a person refuses to acknowledge her own unconscious feelings and instead sees those feelings insomeone else. Other defense mechanisms include rationalization, displacement, and sublimation.LINK TO LEARNINGWatch this video of Freud's defense mechanisms (http://openstax.org/l/defmech) to review.Stages of Psychosexual DevelopmentFreud believed that personality develops during early childhood: Childhood experiences shape ourpersonalities as well as our behavior as adults. He asserted that we develop via a series of stages duringchildhood. Each of us must pass through these childhood stages, and if we do not have the proper nurturingand parenting during a stage, we will be stuck, or fixated, in that stage, even as adults.In each psychosexual stage of development, the child\u2019s pleasure-seeking urges, coming from the id, arefocused on a different area of the body, called an erogenous zone. The stages are oral, anal, phallic, latency, andgenital (Table 11.1).Freud\u2019s psychosexual development theory is quite controversial. To understand the origins of the theory, it ishelpful to be familiar with the political, social, and cultural influences of Freud\u2019s day in Vienna at the turn ofthe 20th century. During this era, a climate of sexual repression, combined with limited understanding andeducation surrounding human sexuality, heavily influenced Freud\u2019s perspective. Given that sex was a tabootopic, Freud assumed that negative emotional states (neuroses) stemmed from suppression of unconscioussexual and aggressive urges. For Freud, his own recollections and interpretations of patients\u2019 experiences anddreams were sufficient proof that psychosexual stages were universal events in early childhood.Freud\u2019s Stages of Psychosexual DevelopmentStageAge (years) Erogenous ZoneMajor ConflictAdult Fixation ExampleOralAnalPhallic0\u201311\u201333\u20136MouthAnusWeaning off breast or bottle Smoking, overeatingToilet trainingNeatness, messinessGenitalsOedipus/Electra complexVanity, overambitionLatency 6\u201312NoneNoneNoneTABLE 11.1"

Eating and the pleasure derived fromsucking (nipples, pacifiers, and thumbs) play a large part in a baby\u2019s first year of life. At around 1 year of age,babies are weaned from the bottle or breast, and this process can create conflict if not handled properly bycaregivers. According to Freud, an adult who smokes, drinks, overeats, or bites her nails is fixated in the oralstage of her psychosexual development; she may have been weaned too early or too late, resulting in thesefixation tendencies, all of which seek to ease anxiety.Anal StageAfter passing through the oral stage, children enter what Freud termed the anal stage (1\u20133 years). In this stage,children experience pleasure in their bowel and bladder movements, so it makes sense that the conflict in thisstage is over toilet training. During this stage of development, children work to master control of themselves.Freud suggested that success at the anal stage depended on how parents handled toilet training. Parents whooffer praise and rewards encourage positive results and can help children feel competent. Parents who areharsh in toilet training can cause a child to become so fearful of soiling that they over-control and becomefixated at the anal stage, leading to the development of an anal-retentive personality. The anal-retentivepersonality is stingy and stubborn, has a compulsive need for order and neatness, and might be considered aperfectionist. If parents are too lenient in toilet training, the child may fail to develop sufficient self-control,become fixated at this stage, and develop an anal-expulsive personality. The anal-expulsive personality ismessy, careless, disorganized, and prone to emotional outbursts.Phallic StageFreud\u2019s third stage of psychosexual development is the phallic stage (3\u20136 years), corresponding to the agewhen children become aware of their bodies and recognize the differences between boys and girls. Theerogenous zone in this stage is the genitals. Conflict arises when the child feels a desire for the opposite-sexparent, and jealousy and hatred toward the same-sex parent. For boys, this is called the Oedipus complex,involving a boy's desire for his mother and his urge to replace his father who is seen as a rival for the mother\u2019sattention. At the same time, the boy is afraid his father will punish him for his feelings, so he experiencescastration anxiety. The Oedipus complex is successfully resolved when the boy begins to identify with hisfather as an indirect way to have the mother. Failure to resolve the Oedipus complex may result in fixation anddevelopment of a personality that might be described as vain and overly ambitious.Girls experience a comparable conflict in the phallic stage\u2014the Electra complex. The Electra complex, whileoften attributed to Freud, was actually proposed by Freud\u2019s prot\u00e9g\u00e9, Carl Jung (Jung & Kerenyi, 1963). A girldesires the attention of her father and wishes to take her mother\u2019s place. Jung also said that girls are angrywith the mother for not providing them with a penis\u2014which he termed penis envy. While Freud initiallyembraced the Electra complex as a parallel to the Oedipus complex, he later rejected it, yet it remains as acornerstone of Freudian theory, thanks in part to academics in the field (Freud, 1931/1968; Scott, 2005).Latency PeriodFollowing the phallic stage of psychosexual development is a period known as the latency period (6 years topuberty). This period is not considered a stage, because sexual feelings are dormant as children focus on otherpursuits, such as school, friendships, hobbies, and sports. Children generally engage in activities with peers ofthe same sex, which serves to consolidate a child\u2019s gender-role identity."

The young person redirects these urges to other, more socially acceptable partners(who often resemble the other-sex parent). People in this stage have mature sexual interests, which for Freudmeant a strong desire for the opposite sex. Individuals who successfully completed the previous stages,reaching the genital stage with no fixations, are said to be well-balanced, healthy adults.While most of Freud\u2019s ideas have not found support in modern research, and several contemporaryresearchers rejected his premises, we cannot discount the contributions that Freud has made to the field ofpsychology. It was Freud who pointed out that a large part of our mental life is influenced by the experiences ofearly childhood and takes place outside of our conscious awareness; his theories paved the way for others.While Freud's focus on biological drives led him to emphasize the impact of sociocultural factors onpersonality development, his followers quickly realized that biology alone could not account for the diversitythey encountered as the practice of psychoanalysis spread during the time of the Nazi Holocaust. Theantisemitism which was prevalent during this period of time may have led mainstream psychoanalysts tofocus primarily on the universality of the psychological structures of the mind."

Hesubsequently founded a school of psychology called individual psychology, which focuses on our drive tocompensate for feelings of inferiority. Adler (1937, 1956) proposed the concept of the inferiority complex. Aninferiority complex refers to a person\u2019s feelings that they lack worth and don\u2019t measure up to the standards ofothers or of society. Adler\u2019s ideas about inferiority represent a major difference between his thinking andFreud\u2019s. Freud believed that we are motivated by sexual and aggressive urges, but Adler (1930, 1961) believedthat feelings of inferiority in childhood are what drive people to attempt to gain superiority and that thisstriving is the force behind all of our thoughts, emotions, and behaviors."

Adler noted the inter-relatedness ofhumanity and the need to work together for the betterment of all. He said, \u201cThe happiness of mankind lies inworking together, in living as if each individual had set himself the task of contributing to the common welfare\u201d(Adler, 1964, p. 255) with the main goal of psychology being \u201cto recognize the equal rights and equality ofothers\u201d (Adler, 1961, p. 691).With these ideas, Adler identified three fundamental social tasks that all of us must experience: occupationaltasks (careers), societal tasks (friendship), and love tasks (finding an intimate partner for a long-termrelationship). Rather than focus on sexual or aggressive motives for behavior as Freud did, Adler focused onsocial motives. He also emphasized conscious rather than unconscious motivation, since he believed that thethree fundamental social tasks are explicitly known and pursued. That is not to say that Adler did not alsobelieve in unconscious processes\u2014he did\u2014but he felt that conscious processes were more important.One of Adler\u2019s major contributions to personality psychology was the idea that our birth order shapes ourpersonality. He proposed that older siblings, who start out as the focus of their parents\u2019 attention but mustshare that attention once a new child joins the family, compensate by becoming overachievers. The youngestchildren, according to Adler, may be spoiled, leaving the middle child with the opportunity to minimize thenegative dynamics of the youngest and oldest children.

It was Anna Freudwho encouraged Erikson to study psychoanalysis. Erikson received his diploma from the ViennaPsychoanalytic Institute in 1933, and as Nazism spread across Europe, he fled the country and immigrated tothe United States that same year. As you learned when you studied lifespan development, Erikson laterproposed a psychosocial theory of development, suggesting that an individual\u2019s personality developsthroughout the lifespan\u2014a departure from Freud\u2019s view that personality is fixed in early life. In his theory,Erikson emphasized the social relationships that are important at each stage of personality development, incontrast to Freud\u2019s emphasis on sex. Erikson identified eight stages, each of which represents a conflict ordevelopmental task (Table 11.2). The development of a healthy personality and a sense of competence dependon the successful completion of each task."

First, Jung, like Adler and Erikson, did notaccept that sexual drive was the primary motivator in a person\u2019s mental life. Second, although Jung agreedwith Freud\u2019s concept of a personal unconscious, he thought it to be incomplete. In addition to the personalunconscious, Jung focused on the collective unconscious.The collective unconscious is a universal version of the personal unconscious, holding mental patterns, ormemory traces, which are common to all of us (Jung, 1928). These ancestral memories, which Jung calledarchetypes, are represented by universal themes in various cultures, as expressed through literature, art, anddreams (Jung). Jung said that these themes reflect common experiences of people the world over, such asfacing death, becoming independent, and striving for mastery. Jung (1964) believed that through biology, eachperson is handed down the same themes and that the same types of symbols\u2014such as the hero, the maiden,the sage, and the trickster\u2014are present in the folklore and fairy tales of every culture. In Jung\u2019s view, the task ofintegrating these unconscious archetypal aspects of the self is part of the self-realization process in the secondhalf of life. With this orientation toward self-realization, Jung parted ways with Freud\u2019s belief that personality isdetermined solely by past events and anticipated the humanistic movement with its emphasis on self-actualization and orientation toward the future.Jung also proposed two attitudes or approaches toward life: extroversion and introversion (Jung, 1923) (Table11.3). These ideas are considered Jung\u2019s most important contributions to the field of personality psychology,as almost all models of personality now include these concepts. If you are an extrovert, then you are a personwho is energized by being outgoing and socially oriented: You derive your energy from being around others. Ifyou are an introvert, then you are a person who may be quiet and reserved, or you may be social, but yourenergy is derived from your inner psychic activity. Jung believed a balance between extroversion andintroversion best served the goal of self-realization.Introverts and ExtrovertsIntrovertExtrovertEnergized by being aloneEnergized by being with othersTABLE 11.3"

Accordingto Jung, we consciously create this persona; however, it is derived from both our conscious experiences andour collective unconscious. What is the purpose of the persona? Jung believed that it is a compromise betweenwho we really are (our true self) and what society expects us to be. We hide those parts of ourselves that are notaligned with society\u2019s expectations.LINK TO LEARNINGJung\u2019s view of extroverted and introverted types serves as a basis of the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI).This questionnaire describes a person\u2019s degree of introversion versus extroversion, thinking versus feeling,intuition versus sensation, and judging versus perceiving. Take this modified questionnaire based on the MBTI(http://openstax.org/l/myersbriggs) to learn more.CONNECT THE CONCEPTSAre Archetypes Genetically Based?Jung proposed that human responses to archetypes are similar to instinctual responses in animals. One criticism ofJung is that there is no evidence that archetypes are biologically based or similar to animal instincts (Roesler, 2012).Jung formulated his ideas about 100 years ago, and great advances have been made in the field of genetics sincethat time. We\u2019ve found that human babies are born with certain capacities, including the ability to acquire language.However, we\u2019ve also found that symbolic information (such as archetypes) is not encoded on the genome and thatbabies cannot decode symbolism, refuting the idea of a biological basis to archetypes. Rather than being seen aspurely biological, more recent research suggests that archetypes emerge directly from our experiences and arereflections of linguistic or cultural characteristics (Young-Eisendrath, 1995). Today, most Jungian scholars believethat the collective unconscious and archetypes are based on both innate and environmental influences, with thedifferences being in the role and degree of each (Sotirova-Kohli et al., 2013).Karen HorneyKaren Horney was one of the first women trained as a Freudian psychoanalyst. During the Great Depression,Horney moved from Germany to the United States, and subsequently moved away from Freud\u2019s teachings.

According to Horney, any jealousy is most likely culturally based, due to the greaterprivileges that men often have, meaning that the differences between men\u2019s and women\u2019s personalities areculturally based, not biologically based. She further suggested that men have womb envy, because they cannotgive birth.Horney\u2019s theories focused on the role of unconscious anxiety. She suggested that normal growth can beblocked by basic anxiety stemming from needs not being met, such as childhood experiences of lonelinessand/or isolation. How do children learn to handle this anxiety? Horney suggested three styles of coping (Table11.4). The first coping style, moving toward people, relies on affiliation and dependence. These childrenbecome dependent on their parents and other caregivers in an effort to receive attention and affection, whichprovides relief from anxiety (Burger, 2008). When these children grow up, they tend to use this same copingstrategy to deal with relationships, expressing an intense need for love and acceptance (Burger, 2008). Thesecond coping style, moving against people, relies on aggression and assertiveness. Children with this copingstyle find that fighting is the best way to deal with an unhappy home situation, and they deal with their feelingsof insecurity by bullying other children (Burger, 2008). As adults, people with this coping style tend to lash outwith hurtful comments and exploit others (Burger, 2008). The third coping style, moving away from people,centers on detachment and isolation. These children handle their anxiety by withdrawing from the world. Theyneed privacy and tend to be self-sufficient. When these children are adults, they continue to avoid such thingsas love and friendship, and they also tend to gravitate toward careers that require little interaction with others(Burger, 2008).Horney\u2019s Coping StylesCoping StyleDescriptionExampleMoving towardpeopleAffiliation anddependenceChild seeking positive attention and affection from parent; adult needingloveMoving againstpeopleAggression andmanipulationChild fighting or bullying other children; adult who is abrasive andverbally hurtful, or who exploits othersMoving awayfrom peopleDetachment andisolationTABLE 11.4Child withdrawn from the world and isolated; adult lonerHorney believed these three styles are ways in which people typically cope with day-to-day problems; however,the three coping styles can become neurotic strategies if they are used rigidly and compulsively, leading aperson to become alienated from others."

Instead,they view personality as significantly shaped by the reinforcements and consequences outside of theorganism. In other words, people behave in a consistent manner based on prior learning. B. F. Skinner, a strictbehaviorist, believed that environment was solely responsible for all behavior, including the enduring,consistent behavior patterns studied by personality theorists.As you may recall from your study on the psychology of learning, Skinner proposed that we demonstrateconsistent behavior patterns because we have developed certain response tendencies (Skinner, 1953). In otherwords, we learnto behave in particular ways. We increase the behaviors that lead to positive consequences,and we decrease the behaviors that lead to negative consequences. Skinner disagreed with Freud\u2019s idea thatpersonality is fixed in childhood. He argued that personality develops over our entire life, not only in the firstfew years. Our responses can change as we come across new situations; therefore, we can expect morevariability over time in personality than Freud would anticipate. For example, consider a young woman, Greta,a risk taker. She drives fast and participates in dangerous sports such as hang gliding and kiteboarding. Butafter she gets married and has children, the system of reinforcements and punishments in her environmentchanges. Speeding and extreme sports are no longer reinforced, so she no longer engages in those behaviors.In fact, Greta now describes herself as a cautious person.The Social-Cognitive PerspectiveAlbert Bandura agreed with Skinner that personality develops through learning. He disagreed, however, withSkinner\u2019s strict behaviorist approach to personality development, because he felt that thinking and reasoningare important components of learning. He presented a social-cognitive theory of personality that emphasizesboth learning and cognition as sources of individual differences in personality. In social-cognitive theory, theconcepts of reciprocal determinism, observational learning, and self-efficacy all play a part in personalitydevelopment.Reciprocal DeterminismIn contrast to Skinner\u2019s idea that the environment alone determines behavior, Bandura (1990) proposed theconcept of reciprocal determinism, in which cognitive processes, behavior, and context all interact, eachfactor influencing and being influenced by the others simultaneously (Figure 11.10). Cognitive processesreferto all characteristics previously learned, including beliefs, expectations, and personality characteristics.Behaviorrefers to anything that we do that may be rewarded or punished. Finally, the contextin which thebehavior occurs refers to the environment or situation, which includes rewarding/punishing stimuli.FIGURE 11.10 Bandura proposed the idea of reciprocal determinism: Our behavior, cognitive processes, andsituational context all influence each other.Consider, for example, that you\u2019re at a festival and one of the attractions is bungee jumping from a bridge. Doyou do it? In this example, the behavior is bungee jumping. Cognitive factors that might influence this behavior"

Finally, context refers to thereward structure for the behavior. According to reciprocal determinism, all of these factors are in play.Observational LearningBandura\u2019s key contribution to learning theory was the idea that much learning is vicarious. We learn byobserving someone else\u2019s behavior and its consequences, which Bandura called observational learning. He feltthat this type of learning also plays a part in the development of our personality. Just as we learn individualbehaviors, we learn new behavior patterns when we see them performed by other people or models. Drawingon the behaviorists\u2019 ideas about reinforcement, Bandura suggested that whether we choose to imitate amodel\u2019s behavior depends on whether we see the model reinforced or punished. Through observationallearning, we come to learn what behaviors are acceptable and rewarded in our culture, and we also learn toinhibit deviant or socially unacceptable behaviors by seeing what behaviors are punished.We can see the principles of reciprocal determinism at work in observational learning. For example, personalfactors determine which behaviors in the environment a person chooses to imitate, and those environmentalevents in turn are processed cognitively according to other personal factors. One person may experiencereceiving attention as reinforcing, and that person may be more inclined to imitate behaviors such as boastingwhen a model has been reinforced. For others, boasting may be viewed negatively, despite the attention thatmight result\u2014or receiving heightened attention may be perceived as being scrutinized. In either case, theperson may be less likely to imitate those behaviors even though the reasons for not doing so would bedifferent.Self-EfficacyBandura (1977, 1995) has studied a number of cognitive and personal factors that affect learning andpersonality development, and most recently has focused on the concept of self-efficacy. Self-efficacy is ourlevel of confidence in our own abilities, developed through our social experiences. Self-efficacy affects how weapproach challenges and reach goals. In observational learning, self-efficacy is a cognitive factor that affectswhich behaviors we choose to imitate as well as our success in performing those behaviors.People who have high self-efficacy believe that their goals are within reach, have a positive view of challengesseeing them as tasks to be mastered, develop a deep interest in and strong commitment to the activities inwhich they are involved, and quickly recover from setbacks. Conversely, people with low self-efficacy avoidchallenging tasks because they doubt their ability to be successful, tend to focus on failure and negativeoutcomes, and lose confidence in their abilities if they experience setbacks. Feelings of self-efficacy can bespecific to certain situations. For instance, a student might feel confident in her ability in English class butmuch less so in math class.Julian Rotter and Locus of ControlJulian Rotter (1966) proposed the concept of locus of control, another cognitive factor that affects learning andpersonality development. Distinct from self-efficacy, which involves our belief in our own abilities, locus ofcontrol refers to our beliefs about the power we have over our lives. In Rotter\u2019s view, people possess either aninternal or an external locus of control (Figure 11.11). Those of us with an internal locus of control (\u201cinternals\u201d)tend to believe that most of our outcomes are the direct result of our efforts. Those of us with an external locusof control (\u201cexternals\u201d) tend to believe that our outcomes are outside of our control. Externals see their lives asbeing controlled by other people, luck, or chance. For example, say you didn\u2019t spend much time studying foryour psychology test and went out to dinner with friends instead. When you receive your test score, you seethat you earned a D. If you possess an internal locus of control, you would most likely admit that you failedbecause you didn\u2019t spend enough time studying and decide to study more for the next test. On the other hand,if you possess an external locus of control, you might conclude that the test was too hard and not botherstudying for the next test, because you figure you will fail it anyway. Researchers have found that people withan internal locus of control perform better academically, achieve more in their careers, are more independent,"

Mischel surveyed several decades of empirical psychological literature regarding traitprediction of behavior, and his conclusion shook the foundations of personality psychology. Mischel found thatthe data did not support the central principle of the field\u2014that a person\u2019s personality traits are consistentacross situations. His report triggered a decades-long period of self-examination, known as the person-situation debate, among personality psychologists.Mischel suggested that perhaps we were looking for consistency in the wrong places. He found that althoughbehavior was inconsistent across different situations, it was much more consistent within situations\u2014so that aperson\u2019s behavior in one situation would likely be repeated in a similar one. And as you will see next regardinghis famous \u201cmarshmallow test,\u201d Mischel also found that behavior is consistent in equivalent situations acrosstime.One of Mischel\u2019s most notable contributions to personality psychology was his ideas on self-regulation.According to Lecci & Magnavita (2013), \u201cSelf-regulation is the process of identifying a goal or set of goals and,in pursuing these goals, using both internal (e.g., thoughts and affect) and external (e.g., responses of anythingor anyone in the environment) feedback to maximize goal attainment\u201d (p. 6.3). Self-regulation is also known aswill power. When we talk about will power, we tend to think of it as the ability to delay gratification. Forexample, Bettina\u2019s teenage son made strawberry cupcakes, and they looked delicious. However, Bettinaforfeited the pleasure of eating one, because she is training for a 5K race and wants to be fit and do well in therace. Would you be able to resist getting a small reward now in order to get a larger reward later? This is thequestion Mischel investigated in his now-classic marshmallow test.Mischel designed a study to assess self-regulation in young children. In the marshmallow study, Mischel andhis colleagues placed a preschool child in a room with one marshmallow on the table. The children were toldthey could either eat the marshmallow now, or wait until the researcher returned to the room, and then theycould have two marshmallows (Mischel, Ebbesen & Raskoff, 1972). This was repeated with hundreds ofpreschoolers. What Mischel and his team found was that young children differ in their degree of self-control.Mischel and his colleagues continued to follow this group of preschoolers through high school, and what doyou think they discovered? The children who had more self-control in preschool (the ones who waited for thebigger reward) were more successful in high school. They had higher SAT scores, had positive peerrelationships, and were less likely to have substance abuse issues; as adults, they also had more stablemarriages (Mischel, Shoda, & Rodriguez, 1989; Mischel et al., 2010). On the other hand, those children who hadpoor self-control in preschool (the ones who grabbed the one marshmallow) were not as successful in highschool, and they were found to have academic and behavioral problems. A more recent study using a largerand more representative sample found associations between early delay of gratification (Watts, Duncan, &"

However, researchers also found that theassociations were not as strong as those reported during Mischel's initial experiment and were quite sensitiveto situational factors such as early measures of cognitive capacity, family background, and home environment.This research suggests that consideration of situational factors is important to better understand behavior.LINK TO LEARNINGWatch Joachim de Posada's TEDTalk about the marshmallow test (http://openstax.org/l/TEDPosada) to learnmore and to see the test given to children in Colombia.Today, the debate is mostly resolved, and most psychologists consider both the situation and personal factorsin understanding behavior. For Mischel (1993), people are situation processors. The children in themarshmallow test each processed, or interpreted, the rewards structure of that situation in their own way.Mischel\u2019s approach to personality stresses the importance of both the situation and the way the personperceives the situation. Instead of behavior being determined by the situation, people use cognitive processesto interpret the situation and then behave in accordance with that interpretation."

It does not suggest that psychoanalytic, behaviorist, and other points of view are incorrect but arguesthat these perspectives do not recognize the depth and meaning of human experience, and fail to recognize theinnate capacity for self-directed change and transforming personal experiences. This perspective focuses onhow healthy people develop. One pioneering humanist, Abraham Maslow, studied people who he considered tobe healthy, creative, and productive, including Albert Einstein, Eleanor Roosevelt, Thomas Jefferson, AbrahamLincoln, and others. Maslow (1950, 1970) found that such people share similar characteristics, such as beingopen, creative, loving, spontaneous, compassionate, concerned for others, and accepting of themselves. Whenyou studied motivation, you learned about one of the best-known humanistic theories, Maslow's hierarchy ofneeds theory, in which Maslow proposes that human beings have certain needs in common and that theseneeds must be met in a certain order. The highest need is the need for self-actualization, which is theachievement of our fullest potential. Maslow differentiated between needs that motivate us to fulfill somethingthat is missing and needs that inspire us to grow. He believed that many emotional and behavioral concernsarise as a result of failing to meet these hierarchical needs.Another humanistic theorist was Carl Rogers. One of Rogers\u2019s main ideas about personality regards self-concept, our thoughts and feelings about ourselves. How would you respond to the question, \u201cWho am I?\u201d Youranswer can show how you see yourself. If your response is primarily positive, then you tend to feel good aboutwho you are, and you see the world as a safe and positive place. If your response is mainly negative, then youmay feel unhappy with who you are. Rogers further divided the self into two categories: the ideal self and thereal self. The ideal self is the person that you would like to be; the real self is the person you actually are.Rogers focused on the idea that we need to achieve consistency between these two selves. We experiencecongruence when our thoughts about our real self and ideal self are very similar\u2014in other words, when ourself-concept is accurate. High congruence leads to a greater sense of self-worth and a healthy, productive life.Parents can help their children achieve this by giving them unconditional positive regard, or unconditionallove. According to Rogers (1980), \u201cAs persons are accepted and prized, they tend to develop a more caringattitude towards themselves\u201d (p. 116). Conversely, when there is a great discrepancy between our ideal and"

Psychologists who favor the biological approach believe that inheritedpredispositions as well as physiological processes can be used to explain differences in our personalities(Burger, 2008).Evolutionary psychology relative to personality development looks at personality traits that are universal, aswell as differences across individuals. In this view, adaptive differences have evolved and then provide asurvival and reproductive advantage. Individual differences are important from an evolutionary viewpoint forseveral reasons. Certain individual differences, and the heritability of these characteristics, have been welldocumented. David Buss has identified several theories to explore this relationship between personality traitsand evolution, such as life-history theory, which looks at how people expend their time and energy (such as onbodily growth and maintenance, reproduction, or parenting). Another example is costly signaling theory,which examines the honesty and deception in the signals people send one another about their quality as amate or friend (Buss, 2009).In the field of behavioral genetics, the Minnesota Study of Twins Reared Apart\u2014a well-known study of thegenetic basis for personality\u2014conducted research with twins from 1979 to 1999. In studying 350 pairs oftwins, including pairs of identical and fraternal twins reared together and apart, researchers found thatidentical twins, whether raised together or apart, have very similar personalities (Bouchard, 1994; Bouchard,Lykken, McGue, Segal, & Tellegen, 1990; Segal, 2012). These findings suggest the heritability of somepersonality traits. Heritability refers to the proportion of difference among people that is attributed togenetics. Some of the traits that the study reported as having more than a 0.50 heritability ratio includeleadership, obedience to authority, a sense of well-being, alienation, resistance to stress, and fearfulness. Theimplication is that some aspects of our personalities are largely controlled by genetics; however, it\u2019s importantto point out that traits are not determined by a single gene, but by a combination of many genes, as well as byepigenetic factors that control whether the genes are expressed.Other research that has examined the link between personality and other factors has identified and studiedType A and Type B personalities, which you will learn more about in the chapter on Stress, Health, andLifestyle.LINK TO LEARNINGWatch this video about genetic makeup's influence on personality (http://openstax.org/l/persondna) to learnmore.TemperamentMost contemporary psychologists believe temperament has a biological basis due to its appearance very earlyin our lives (Rothbart, 2011). As you learned when you studied lifespan development, Thomas and Chess(1977) found that babies could be categorized into one of three temperaments: easy, difficult, or slow to warmup. However, environmental factors (family interactions, for example) and maturation can affect the ways inwhich children\u2019s personalities are expressed (Carter et al., 2008)."

Do you tend to be sociable or shy? Passive or aggressive? Optimistic orpessimistic? Moody or even-tempered? Early trait theorists tried to describe all human personality traits. Forexample, one trait theorist, Gordon Allport (Allport & Odbert, 1936), found 4,500 words in the English languagethat could describe people. He organized these personality traits into three categories: cardinal traits, centraltraits, and secondary traits. A cardinal trait is one that dominates your entire personality, and hence yourlife\u2014such as Ebenezer Scrooge\u2019s greed and Mother Theresa\u2019s altruism. Cardinal traits are not very common:Few people have personalities dominated by a single trait. Instead, our personalities typically are composed ofmultiple traits. Central traits are those that make up our personalities (such as loyal, kind, agreeable, friendly,sneaky, wild, and grouchy). Secondary traits are those that are not quite as obvious or as consistent as centraltraits. They are present under specific circumstances and include preferences and attitudes. For example, oneperson gets angry when people try to tickle him; another can only sleep on the left side of the bed; and yetanother always orders her salad dressing on the side. And you\u2014although not normally an anxious person\u2014feelnervous before making a speech in front of your English class.In an effort to make the list of traits more manageable, Raymond Cattell (1946, 1957) narrowed down the list toabout 171 traits. However, saying that a trait is either present or absent does not accurately reflect a person\u2019suniqueness, because all of our personalities are actually made up of the same traits; we differ only in thedegree to which each trait is expressed. Cattell (1957) identified 16 factors or dimensions of personality:warmth, reasoning, emotional stability, dominance, liveliness, rule-consciousness, social boldness, sensitivity,vigilance, abstractedness, privateness, apprehension, openness to change, self-reliance, perfectionism, andtension (Table 11.5). He developed a personality assessment based on these 16 factors, called the 16PF.Instead of a trait being present or absent, each dimension is scored over a continuum, from high to low. Forexample, your level of warmth describes how warm, caring, and nice to others you are. If you score low on thisindex, you tend to be more distant and cold. A high score on this index signifies you are supportive andcomforting.Personality Factors Measured by the 16PF QuestionnaireFactorLow ScoreHigh ScoreWarmthIntellectReserved, detachedOutgoing, supportiveConcrete thinkerAnalyticalEmotional stabilityMoody, irritableStable, calmAggressivenessDocile, submissiveControlling, dominantTABLE 11.5"

In the neuroticism/stability dimension, people highon neuroticism tend to be anxious; they tend to have an overactive sympathetic nervous system and, even withlow stress, their bodies and emotional state tend to go into a flight-or-fight reaction. In contrast, people high onstability tend to need more stimulation to activate their flight-or-fight reaction and are considered moreemotionally stable. Based on these two dimensions, the Eysencks\u2019 theory divides people into four quadrants.These quadrants are sometimes compared with the four temperaments described by the Greeks: melancholic,choleric, phlegmatic, and sanguine (Figure 11.13)."

In this dimension, people who are high on psychoticism tend to be independent thinkers, cold,nonconformists, impulsive, antisocial, and hostile, whereas people who are high on superego control tend tohave high impulse control\u2014they are more altruistic, empathetic, cooperative, and conventional (Eysenck,Eysenck & Barrett, 1985).While Cattell\u2019s 16 factors may be too broad, the Eysenck\u2019s two-factor system has been criticized for being toonarrow. Another personality theory, called the Five Factor Model, effectively hits a middle ground, with its fivefactors referred to as the Big Five personality factors. It is the most popular theory in personality psychologytoday and the most accurate approximation of the basic personality dimensions (Funder, 2001). The fivefactors are openness to experience, conscientiousness, extroversion, agreeableness, and neuroticism (Figure11.14). A helpful way to remember the factors is by using the mnemonic OCEAN.In the Five Factor Model, each person has each factor, but they occur along a spectrum. Openness toexperience is characterized by imagination, feelings, actions, and ideas. People who score high on this factortend to be curious and have a wide range of interests. Conscientiousness is characterized by competence, self-discipline, thoughtfulness, and achievement-striving (goal-directed behavior). People who score high on thisfactor are hardworking and dependable. Numerous studies have found a positive correlation betweenconscientiousness and academic success (Akomolafe, 2013; Chamorro-Premuzic & Furnham, 2008; Conrad &Patry, 2012; Noftle & Robins, 2007; Wagerman & Funder, 2007). Extroversion is characterized by sociability,assertiveness, excitement-seeking, and emotional expression. People who score high on this factor are usuallydescribed as outgoing and warm. Not surprisingly, people who score high on both extroversion and opennessare more likely to participate in adventure and risky sports due to their curious and excitement-seeking nature(Tok, 2011). The fourth factor is agreeableness, which is the tendency to be pleasant, cooperative, trustworthy,and good-natured. People who score low on agreeableness tend to be described as rude and uncooperative, yetone recent study reported that men who scored low on this factor actually earned more money than men whowere considered more agreeable (Judge, Livingston, & Hurst, 2012).

People high on neuroticism tend toexperience emotional instability and are characterized as angry, impulsive, and hostile.

In reality, most of us tend to liesomewhere midway along the continuum of each factor, rather than at polar ends. It\u2019s important to note thatthe Big Five factors are relatively stable over our lifespan, with some tendency for the factors to increase ordecrease slightly. Researchers have found that conscientiousness increases through young adulthood intomiddle age, as we become better able to manage our personal relationships and careers (Donnellan & Lucas,2008). Agreeableness also increases with age, peaking between 50 to 70 years (Terracciano, McCrae, Brant, &Costa, 2005). Neuroticism and extroversion tend to decline slightly with age (Donnellan & Lucas; Terraccianoet al.). Additionally, The Big Five factors have been shown to exist across ethnicities, cultures, and ages, andmay have substantial biological and genetic components (Jang, Livesley, & Vernon, 1996; Jang et al., 2006;McCrae & Costa, 1997; Schmitt et al., 2007).Another model of personality traits is the HEXACO model. HEXACO is an acronym for six broad traits: honesty-humility, emotionality, extraversion, agreeableness, conscientiousness, and openness to experience (Anglim &O\u2019Connor, 2018).

Theculture in which you live is one of the most important environmental factors that shapes your personality(Triandis & Suh, 2002). The term culture refers to all of the beliefs, customs, art, and traditions of a particularsociety. Culture is transmitted to people through language as well as through the modeling of culturallyacceptable and nonacceptable behaviors that are either rewarded or punished (Triandis & Suh, 2002). Withthese ideas in mind, personality psychologists have become interested in the role of culture in understandingpersonality. They ask whether personality traits are the same across cultures or if there are variations. Itappears that there are both universal and culture-specific aspects that account for variation in people\u2019spersonalities.Why might it be important to consider cultural influences on personality? Western ideas about personalitymay not be applicable to other cultures (Benet-Martinez & Oishi, 2008). In fact, there is evidence that thestrength of personality traits varies across cultures. Let\u2019s take a look at some of the Big Five factors(conscientiousness, neuroticism, openness, and extroversion) across cultures. As you will learn when youstudy social psychology, Asian cultures are more collectivist, and people in these cultures tend to be lessextroverted. People in Central and South American cultures tend to score higher on openness to experience,whereas Europeans score higher on neuroticism (Benet-Martinez & Karakitapoglu-Aygun, 2003).According to a study by Rentfrow and colleagues, there also seem to be regional personality differences withinthe United States (Figure 11.15). Researchers analyzed responses from over 1.5 million individuals in theUnited States and found that there are three distinct regional personality clusters: Cluster 1, which is in theUpper Midwest and Deep South, is dominated by people who fall into the \u201cfriendly and conventional\u201dpersonality; Cluster 2, which includes the West, is dominated by people who are more relaxed, emotionally"

People tend to befriendly and conventional in the Upper Midwest and Deep South; relaxed, emotionally stable, and creative in theWest; and stressed, irritable, and depressed in the Northeast (Rentfrow et al., 2013).One explanation for the regional differences is selective migration (Rentfrow et al., 2013). Selective migrationis the concept that people choose to move to places that are compatible with their personalities and needs. Forexample, a person high on the agreeable scale would likely want to live near family and friends, and wouldchoose to settle or remain in such an area. In contrast, someone high on openness would prefer to settle in aplace that is recognized as diverse and innovative (such as California). Further, Rentfrow, Jost, Gosling, & Potter(2009) noted an overlap between geographical regions and personality characteristics that goes beyond theoften-used explanations of religion, racial diversity, and education. Their research suggests that thepsychological profile of a region is closely related to that of its residents. They found that levels of opennessand conscientiousness in a state may predict voting patterns, indicating that there are correlations betweengeographic regions and personality differences between liberals and conservatives relating to political views,levels of economic vitality, and entrepreneurial rates.Personality in Individualist and Collectivist CulturesIndividualist cultures and collectivist cultures place emphasis on different basic values. People who live inindividualist cultures tend to believe that independence, competition, and personal achievement areimportant.

People who live in collectivist cultures value socialharmony, respectfulness, and group needs over individual needs. Individuals who live in countries in Asia,Africa, and South America score high on collectivism (Hofstede, 2001; Triandis, 1995). These values influencepersonality. For example, Yang (2006) found that people in individualist cultures displayed more personallyoriented personality traits, whereas people in collectivist cultures displayed more socially oriented personalitytraits. Frewer and Bleus (1991) conducted a study of the Eysenk Personality Inventory in a collectivist cultureusing Papua New Guinean university students. They found that the results of the personality inventory wereonly relevant when analyzed within the context of a collectivist society. Similarly, Dana (1986) suggested thatpersonality assessment services for Native Americans are often provided without a proper recognition ofculture-specific responses and a tribe-specific frame of reference. Assessors need to have more than a generalknowledge of history, tribal differences, contemporary culture on reservations, and levels of acculturation inorder to interpret psychological test responses with a minimal bias.Approaches to Studying Personality in a Cultural ContextThere are three approaches that can be used to study personality in a cultural context, the cultural-comparative approach; the indigenous approach; and the combined approach, which incorporates elements ofboth views. Since ideas about personality have a Western basis, the cultural-comparative approach seeks totest Western ideas about personality in other cultures to determine whether they can be generalized and ifthey have cultural validity (Cheung van de Vijver, & Leong, 2011). For example, recall from the previous sectionon the trait perspective that researchers used the cultural-comparative approach to test the universality ofMcCrae and Costa\u2019s Five Factor Model. They found applicability in numerous cultures around the world, withthe Big Five factors being stable in many cultures (McCrae & Costa, 1997; McCrae et al., 2005). The indigenousapproach came about in reaction to the dominance of Western approaches to the study of personality in non-Western settings (Cheung et al., 2011). Because Western-based personality assessments cannot fully capturethe personality constructs of other cultures, the indigenous model has led to the development of personalityassessment instruments that are based on constructs relevant to the culture being studied (Cheung et al.,2011). The third approach to cross-cultural studies of personality is the combined approach, which serves as abridge between Western and indigenous psychology as a way of understanding both universal and culturalvariations in personality (Cheung et al., 2011)."

Self-reportinventories are generally easy to administer and cost effective. There is also an increased likelihood of testtakers being inclined to answer in ways that are intentionally or unintentionally more socially desirable,exaggerated, biased, or misleading. For example, someone applying for a job will likely try to presentthemselves in a positive light, perhaps as an even better candidate than they actually are.FIGURE 11.16 If you\u2019ve ever taken a survey, you are probably familiar with Likert-type scale questions. Mostpersonality inventories employ these types of response scales.One of the most widely used personality inventories is the Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory(MMPI), first published in 1943, with 504 true/false questions, and updated to the MMPI-2 in 1989, with 567questions. The original MMPI was based on a small, limited sample, composed mostly of Minnesota farmersand psychiatric patients; the revised inventory was based on a more representative, national sample to allowfor better standardization. The MMPI-2 takes 1\u20132 hours to complete. Responses are scored to produce aclinical profile composed of 10 scales: hypochondriasis, depression, hysteria, psychopathic deviance (socialdeviance), masculinity versus femininity, paranoia, psychasthenia (obsessive/compulsive qualities),schizophrenia, hypomania, and social introversion. There is also a scale to ascertain risk factors for alcoholabuse. In 2008, the test was again revised, using more advanced methods, to the MMPI-2-RF. This versiontakes about one-half the time to complete and has only 338 questions (Figure 11.17). Despite the new test\u2019sadvantages, the MMPI-2 is more established and is still more widely used. Typically, the tests are administeredby computer. Although the MMPI was originally developed to assist in the clinical diagnosis of psychologicaldisorders, it is now also used for occupational screening, such as in law enforcement, and in college, career,and marital counseling (Ben-Porath & Tellegen, 2008).FIGURE 11.17 These true/false questions resemble the kinds of questions you would find on the MMPI."

        "data": "Page 388388 11 \u2022 PersonalityIn addition to clinical scales, the tests also have validity and reliability scales. (Recall the concepts of reliabilityand validity from your study of psychological research.) One of the validity scales, the Lie Scale (or \u201cL\u201d Scale),consists of 15 items and is used to ascertain whether the respondent is \u201cfaking good\u201d (underreportingpsychological problems to appear healthier). For example, if someone responds \u201cyes\u201d to a number ofunrealistically positive items such as \u201cI have never told a lie,\u201d they may be trying to \u201cfake good\u201d or appearbetter than they actually are.Reliability scales test an instrument\u2019s consistency over time, assuring that if you take the MMPI-2-RF today andthen again 5 years later, your two scores will be similar. Beutler, Nussbaum, and Meredith (1988) gave theMMPI to newly recruited police officers and then to the same police officers 2 years later. After 2 years on thejob, police officers\u2019 responses indicated an increased vulnerability to alcoholism, somatic symptoms (vague,unexplained physical complaints), and anxiety. When the test was given an additional 2 years later (4 yearsafter starting on the job), the results suggested high risk for alcohol-related difficulties.Projective TestsAnother method for assessment of personality is projective testing. This kind of test relies on one of thedefense mechanisms proposed by Freud\u2014projection\u2014as a way to assess unconscious processes. During thistype of testing, a series of ambiguous cards is shown to the person being tested, who then is encouraged toproject their feelings, impulses, and desires onto the cards\u2014by telling a story, interpreting an image, orcompleting a sentence. Many projective tests have undergone standardization procedures (for example, Exner,2002) and can be used to access whether someone has unusual thoughts or a high level of anxiety, or is likelyto become volatile. Some examples of projective tests are the Rorschach Inkblot Test, the ThematicApperception Test (TAT), the Contemporized-Themes Concerning Blacks test, the TEMAS (Tell-Me-A-Story),and the Rotter Incomplete Sentence Blank (RISB). Projective tests are less subject to intentional distortion; it ishard to fake \u201cgood\" because it is not obvious what a \"good\u201d answer is. Projective tests are more timeconsuming for the evaluator than self-report inventories. If an evaluator scores the Rorschach using the Exnerscoring system, the test is considered a valid and reliable measure. However, the validity of the other projectivetests is questionable, and the results are often not usable for court cases (Goldstein, n.d.).The Rorschach Inkblot Test was developed in 1921 by a Swiss psychologist named Hermann Rorschach(pronounced \u201cROAR-shock\u201d). It is a series of symmetrical inkblot cards that are presented to a client by apsychologist. Upon presentation of each card, the psychologist asks the client, \u201cWhat might this be?\u201d What thetest-taker sees reveals unconscious feelings and struggles (Piotrowski, 1987; Weiner, 2003). The Rorschachhas been standardized using the Exner system and is effective in measuring depression, psychosis, andanxiety.A second projective test is the Thematic Apperception Test (TAT), created in the 1930s by Henry Murray, anAmerican psychologist, and a psychoanalyst named Christiana Morgan. A person taking the TAT is shown8\u201312 ambiguous pictures and is asked to tell a story about each picture (Figure 11.18). The stories give insightinto their social world, revealing hopes, fears, interests, and goals. The storytelling format helps to lower aperson\u2019s resistance divulging unconscious personal details (Cramer, 2004). The TAT has been used in clinicalsettings to evaluate psychological disorders; more recently, it has been used in counseling settings to helpclients gain a better understanding of themselves and achieve personal growth. Standardization of testadministration is virtually nonexistent among clinicians, and the test tends to be modest to low on validity andreliability (Aronow, Weiss, & Rezinkoff, 2001; Lilienfeld, Wood, & Garb, 2000). Despite these shortcomings, theTAT has been one of the most widely used projective tests."

There are three forms of this test for usewith different age groups: the school form, the college form, and the adult form. The tests include 40incomplete sentences that people are asked to complete as quickly as possible (Figure 11.19). The averagetime for completing the test is approximately 20 minutes, as responses are only 1\u20132 words in length. This testis similar to a word association test, and like other types of projective tests, it is presumed that responses willreveal desires, fears, and struggles. The RISB is used in screening college students for adjustment problemsand in career counseling (Holaday, Smith, & Sherry, 2010; Rotter & Rafferty 1950).FIGURE 11.19 These incomplete sentences resemble the types of questions on the RISB. How would you completethese sentences?For many decades, these traditional projective tests have been used in cross-cultural personality assessments.However, it was found that test bias limited their usefulness (Hoy-Watkins & Jenkins-Moore, 2008). It isdifficult to assess the personalities and lifestyles of members of widely divergent ethnic/cultural groups usingpersonality instruments based on data from a single culture or race (Hoy-Watkins & Jenkins-Moore, 2008). Forexample, when the TAT was used with African-American test takers, the result was often shorter story lengthand low levels of cultural identification (Duzant, 2005). Therefore, it was vital to develop other personalityassessments that explored factors such as race, language, and level of acculturation (Hoy-Watkins & Jenkins-Moore, 2008). To address this need, Robert Williams developed the first culturally specific projective testdesigned to reflect the everyday life experiences of African Americans (Hoy-Watkins & Jenkins-Moore, 2008).The updated version of the instrument is the Contemporized-Themes Concerning Blacks Test (C-TCB)(Williams, 1972). The C-TCB contains 20 color images that show scenes of African-American lifestyles. Whenthe C-TCB was compared with the TAT for African Americans, it was found that use of the C-TCB led toincreased story length, higher degrees of positive feelings, and stronger identification with the C-TCB (Hoy,1997; Hoy-Watkins & Jenkins-Moore, 2008)."

Freud also said that personality developsthrough a series of psychosexual stages. In each stage, pleasure focuses on a specific erogenous zone.

Bandura also emphasized how we learn from watching others. He felt that this type of learningalso plays a part in the development of our personality. Bandura discussed the concept of self-efficacy, which isour level of confidence in our own abilities.

Zimmerman observed the boy dressed in a hoodie and pursued Martin. Zimmerman called thepolice to report a person acting suspiciously, which he had done on other occasions. According to the 911 calltranscript, Zimmerman said on the call, \"[expletive] punks. These [expletive], they always get away.\" The 911operator told Zimmerman not to follow the teen, as was also stated in the police neighborhood watchguidelines that had been provided to Zimmerman. A physical altercation ended with Zimmerman fatallyshooting Martin. Zimmerman claimed that he acted in self-defense. Martin was unarmed, and after his death,there was a nationwide outcry. A Florida jury found Zimmerman not guilty of second degree murder nor ofmanslaughter.There have also been tragic situations with deadly consequences in which police officers have shot innocentcivilians. In 2019, Atatiana Jefferson's neighbor used a non-emergency line to call the police becauseJefferson's front door was open in the late hours of the night. The police arrived and an officer went to the backof the yard. Jefferson, not knowing that the police had been called, reached into her purse and got out herlegally owned gun. The officer perceived a threat and fired upon Jefferson, killing her. Her 8-year-old nephew"

Essentially, people will change their behavior toalign with the social situation at hand. If we are in a new situation or are unsure how to behave, we will take ourcues from other individuals.The field of social psychology studies topics at both the intra- and interpersonal levels. Intrapersonal topics(those that pertain to the individual) include emotions and attitudes, the self, and social cognition (the ways inwhich we think about ourselves and others). Interpersonal topics (those that pertain to dyads and groups)include helping behavior (Figure 12.2), aggression, prejudice and discrimination, attraction and closerelationships, and group processes and intergroup relationships.FIGURE 12.2 Social psychology deals with all kinds of interactions between people, spanning a wide range of howwe connect: from moments of confrontation to moments of working together and helping others, as shown here.(credit: Sgt.

Subfields of psychology tend to focus on oneinfluence or behavior over others. Situationism is the view that our behavior and actions are determined byour immediate environment and surroundings. In contrast, dispositionism holds that our behavior isdetermined by internal factors (Heider, 1958). An internal factor is an attribute of a person and includespersonality traits and temperament. Social psychologists have tended to take the situationist perspective,whereas personality psychologists have promoted the dispositionist perspective. Modern approaches to socialpsychology, however, take both the situation and the individual into account when studying human behavior(Fiske, Gilbert, & Lindzey, 2010). In fact, the field of social-personality psychology has emerged to study thecomplex interaction of internal and situational factors that affect human behavior (Mischel, 1977; Richard,Bond, & Stokes-Zoota, 2003).Fundamental Attribution ErrorIn the United States, the predominant culture tends to favor a dispositional approach in explaining humanbehavior. Why do you think this is? We tend to think that people are in control of their own behaviors, and,therefore, any behavior change must be due to something internal, such as their personality, habits, ortemperament. According to some social psychologists, people tend to overemphasize internal factors asexplanations\u2014or attributions\u2014for the behavior of other people. They tend to assume that the behavior ofanother person is a traitof that person, and to underestimate the power of the situation on the behavior ofothers. They tend to fail to recognize when the behavior of another is due to situational variables, and thus tothe person\u2019s state. This erroneous assumption is called the fundamental attribution error (Ross, 1977; Riggio& Garcia, 2009). To better understand, imagine this scenario: Jamie returns home from work, and opens thefront door to a happy greeting from spouse Morgan who inquires how the day has been. Instead of returningthe spouse\u2019s kind greeting, Jamie yells, \u201cLeave me alone!\u201d Why did Jamie yell? How would someonecommitting the fundamental attribution error explain Jamie\u2019s behavior? The most common response is thatJamie is a mean, angry, or unfriendly person (traits). This is an internal or dispositional explanation. However,imagine that Jamie was just laid off from work due to company downsizing. Would your explanation for Jamie\u2019sbehavior change? Your revised explanation might be that Jamie was frustrated and disappointed about beinglaid off and was therefore in a bad mood (state). This is now an external or situational explanation for Jamie\u2019sbehavior.The fundamental attribution error is so powerful that people often overlook obvious situational influences onbehavior. A classic example was demonstrated in a series of experiments known as the quizmaster study (Ross,Amabile, & Steinmetz, 1977). Student participants were randomly assigned to play the role of a questioner (thequizmaster) or a contestant in a quiz game. Questioners developed difficult questions to which they knew theanswers, and they presented these questions to the contestants. The contestants answered the questionscorrectly only 4 out of 10 times (Figure 12.3). After the task, the questioners and contestants were asked to ratetheir own general knowledge compared to the average student. Questioners did not rate their generalknowledge higher than the contestants, but the contestants rated the questioners\u2019 intelligence higher thantheir own. In a second study, observers of the interaction also rated the questioner as having more generalknowledge than the contestant. The obvious influence on performance is the situation. The questioners wrotethe questions, so of course they had an advantage. Both the contestants and observers made an internalattribution for the performance. They concluded that the questioners must be more intelligent than thecontestants."

(credit: Steve Jurvetson)The halo effect refers to the tendency to let the overall impression of an individual color the way in which wefeel about their character. For instance, we might assume that people who are physically attractive are morelikely to be good people than less attractive individuals. Another example of how the halo effect might manifestwould involve assuming that someone whom we perceive to be outgoing or friendly has a better moralcharacter than someone who is not.As demonstrated in the examples above, the fundamental attribution error is considered a powerful influencein how we explain the behaviors of others. However, it should be noted that some researchers have suggestedthat the fundamental attribution error may not be as powerful as it is often portrayed. In fact, a recent reviewof more than 173 published studies suggests that several factors (e.g., high levels of idiosyncrasy of thecharacter and how well hypothetical events are explained) play a role in determining just how influential thefundamental attribution error is (Malle, 2006).Is the Fundamental Attribution Error a Universal Phenomenon?You may be able to think of examples of the fundamental attribution error in your life. Do people in all culturescommit the fundamental attribution error? Research suggests that they do not. People from an individualisticculture, that is, a culture that focuses on individual achievement and autonomy, have the greatest tendency tocommit the fundamental attribution error. Individualistic cultures, which tend to be found in westerncountries such as the United States, Canada, and the United Kingdom, promote a focus on the individual.Therefore, a person\u2019s disposition is thought to be the primary explanation for her behavior. In contrast, peoplefrom a collectivistic culture, that is, a culture that focuses on communal relationships with others, such asfamily, friends, and community (Figure 12.4), are less likely to commit the fundamental attribution error(Markus & Kitayama, 1991; Triandis, 2001).FIGURE 12.4 People from collectivistic cultures, such as some Asian cultures, are more likely to emphasizerelationships with others than to focus primarily on the individual. Activities such as (a) preparing a meal, (b)hanging out, and (c) playing a game engage people in a group.

This focus on others provides a broader perspective that takes into account bothsituational and cultural influences on behavior; thus, a more nuanced explanation of the causes of others\u2019behavior becomes more likely.

Japanese participants were much more likely to recognizeobjects that were presented when they occurred in the same context in which they were originally viewed.Manipulating the context in which object recall occurred had no such impact on American participants. Otherresearchers have shown similar differences across cultures. For example, Zhang, Fung, Stanley, Isaacowitz,and Zhang (2014) demonstrated differences in the ways that holistic thinking might develop between Chineseand American participants, and Ramesh and Gelfand (2010) demonstrated that job turnover rates are morerelated to the fit between a person and the organization in which they work in an Indian sample, but the fitbetween the person and their specific job was more predictive of turnover in an American sample.Actor-Observer BiasReturning to our earlier example, Jamie was laid off, but an observer would not know. So a na\u00efve observerwould tend to attribute Jamie\u2019s hostile behavior to Jamie\u2019s disposition rather than to the true, situational cause.Why do you think we underestimate the influence of the situation on the behaviors of others? One reason isthat we often don\u2019t have all the information we need to make a situational explanation for another person\u2019sbehavior. The only information we might have is what is observable. Due to this lack of information we have atendency to assume the behavior is due to a dispositional, or internal, factor. When it comes to explaining ourown behaviors, however, we have much more information available to us. If you came home from school orwork angry and yelled at your dog or a loved one, what would your explanation be? You might say you werevery tired or feeling unwell and needed quiet time\u2014a situational explanation. The actor-observer bias is thephenomenon of attributing other people\u2019s behavior to internal factors (fundamental attribution error) whileattributing our own behavior to situational forces (Jones & Nisbett, 1971; Nisbett, Caputo, Legant, & Marecek,1973; Choi & Nisbett, 1998). As actors of behavior, we have more information available to explain our ownbehavior. However as observers, we have less information available; therefore, we tend to default to adispositionist perspective.One study on the actor-observer bias investigated reasons male participants gave for why they liked theirgirlfriend (Nisbett et al., 1973). When asked why participants liked their own girlfriend, participants focusedon internal, dispositional qualities of their girlfriends (for example, her pleasant personality). The participants\u2019explanations rarely included causes internal to themselves, such as dispositional traits (for example, \u201cI needcompanionship.\u201d). In contrast, when speculating why a male friend likes his girlfriend, participants were"

This supports the idea that actors tend to providefew internal explanations but many situational explanations for their own behavior. In contrast, observers tendto provide more dispositional explanations for a friend\u2019s behavior (Figure 12.5).FIGURE 12.5 Actor-observer bias is evident when subjects explain their own reasons for liking a girlfriend versustheir impressions of others\u2019 reasons for liking a girlfriend.Self-Serving BiasWe can understand self-serving bias by digging more deeply into attribution, a belief about the cause of aresult. One model of attribution proposes three main dimensions: locus of control (internal versus external),stability (stable versus unstable), and controllability (controllable versus uncontrollable). In this context,stability refers to the extent in which the circumstances that result in a given outcome are changeable. Thecircumstances are considered stable if they are unlikely to change. Controllability refers to the extent to whichthe circumstances that are associated with a given outcome can be controlled. Obviously, those things that wehave the power to control would be labeled controllable (Weiner, 1979).Following an outcome, self-serving biases are those attributions that enable us to see ourselves in a favorablelight (for example, making internal attributions for success and external attributions for failures). When you dowell at a task, for example acing an exam, it is in your best interest to make a dispositional attribution for yourbehavior (\u201cI\u2019m smart,\u201d) instead of a situational one (\u201cThe exam was easy,\u201d). Self-serving bias is the tendency toexplain our successes as due to dispositional (internal) characteristics, but to explain our failures as due tosituational (external) factors. Again, this is culture dependent. This bias serves to protect self-esteem. You canimagine that if people always made situational attributions for their behavior, they would never be able to takecredit and feel good about their accomplishments.Consider the example of how we explain our favorite sports team\u2019s wins. Research shows that we makeinternal, stable, and controllable attributions for our team\u2019s victory (Figure 12.6) (Grove, Hanrahan, &McInman, 1991). For example, we might tell ourselves that our team is talented (internal), consistently workshard (stable), and uses effective strategies (controllable). In contrast, we are more likely to make external,unstable, and uncontrollable attributions when our favorite team loses. For example, we might tell ourselvesthat the other team has more experienced players or that the referees were unfair (external), the other teamplayed at home (unstable), and the cold weather affected our team\u2019s performance (uncontrollable)."

(credit: \"TheAHL\"/Flickr)Just-World HypothesisOne consequence of westerners\u2019 tendency to provide dispositional explanations for behavior is victim blame(Jost & Major, 2001). When people experience bad fortune, others tend to assume that they somehow areresponsible for their own fate. A common ideology, or worldview, in the United States is the just-worldhypothesis. The just-world hypothesis is the belief that people get the outcomes they deserve (Lerner & Miller,1978). In order to maintain the belief that the world is a fair place, people tend to think that good peopleexperience positive outcomes, and bad people experience negative outcomes (Jost, Banaji, & Nosek, 2004; Jost& Major, 2001). The ability to think of the world as a fair place, where people get what they deserve, allows us tofeel that the world is predictable and that we have some control over our life outcomes (Jost et al., 2004; Jost &Major, 2001). For example, if you want to experience positive outcomes, you just need to work hard to getahead in life.Can you think of a negative consequence of the just-world hypothesis? One negative consequence is people\u2019stendency to blame poor individuals for their plight. What common explanations are given for why people livein poverty? Have you heard statements such as, \u201cThe poor are lazy and just don\u2019t want to work\u201d or \u201cPoorpeople just want to live off the government\u201d? What types of explanations are these, dispositional or situational?These dispositional explanations are clear examples of the fundamental attribution error. Blaming poor peoplefor their poverty ignores situational factors that impact them, such as high unemployment rates, recession,poor educational opportunities, and the familial cycle of poverty (Figure 12.7). Other research shows thatpeople who hold just-world beliefs have negative attitudes toward people who are unemployed and peopleliving with AIDS (Sutton & Douglas, 2005). In the United States and other countries, victims of sexual assaultmay find themselves blamed for their abuse. Victim advocacy groups, such as Domestic Violence Ended(DOVE), attend court in support of victims to ensure that blame is directed at the perpetrators of sexualviolence, not the victims.FIGURE 12.7 People who hold just-world beliefs tend to blame the people in poverty for their circumstances,ignoring situational and cultural causes of poverty.

We have discussed situational perspectives and social psychology\u2019s emphasis on the ways in whicha person\u2019s environment, including culture and other social influences, affect behavior. In this section, weexamine situational forces that have a strong influence on human behavior including social roles, socialnorms, and scripts. We discuss how humans use the social environment as a source of information, or cues, onhow to behave. Situational influences on our behavior have important consequences, such as whether we willhelp a stranger in an emergency or how we would behave in an unfamiliar environment.Social RolesOne major social determinant of human behavior is our social roles. A social role is a pattern of behavior thatis expected of a person in a given setting or group (Hare, 2003). Each one of us has several social roles. Youmay be, at the same time, a student, a parent, an aspiring teacher, a son or daughter, a spouse, and a lifeguard.How do these social roles influence your behavior? Social roles are defined by culturally shared knowledge.That is, nearly everyone in a given culture knows what behavior is expected of a person in a given role. Forexample, what is the social role for a student? If you look around a college classroom you will likely seestudents engaging in studious behavior, taking notes, listening to the professor, reading the textbook, andsitting quietly at their desks (Figure 12.8). Of course you may see students deviating from the expectedstudious behavior such as texting on their phones or using Facebook on their laptops, but in all cases, thestudents that you observe are attending class\u2014a part of the social role of students.FIGURE 12.8 Being a student is just one of the many social roles you have. (credit: modification of work by \u201cRuralInstitute\u201d/Flickr)Social roles, and our related behavior, can vary across different settings. How do you behave when you areengaging in the role of a child attending a family function? Now imagine how you behave when you areengaged in the role of employee at your workplace. It is very likely that your behavior will be different. Perhapsyou are more relaxed and outgoing with your family, making jokes and doing silly things. But at your workplaceyou might speak more professionally, and although you may be friendly, you are also serious and focused ongetting the work completed. These are examples of how our social roles influence and often dictate ourbehavior to the extent that identity and personality can vary with context (that is, in different social groups)(Malloy, Albright, Kenny, Agatstein & Winquist, 1997)."

This shared knowledge comes from social norms. A social norm is a group\u2019sexpectation of what is appropriate and acceptable behavior for its members\u2014how they are supposed to behaveand think (Deutsch & Gerard, 1955; Berkowitz, 2004). How are we expected to act? What are we expected totalk about? What are we expected to wear? In our discussion of social roles we noted that colleges have socialnorms for students\u2019 behavior in the role of student and workplaces have social norms for employees\u2019 behaviorsin the role of employee. Social norms are everywhere including in families, gangs, and on social media outlets.What are some social norms on Instagram?CONNECT THE CONCEPTSTweens, Teens, and Social NormsMy 11-year-old daughter, Janelle, recently told me she needed shorts and shirts for the summer, and that shewanted me to take her to a store at the mall that is popular with preteens and teens to buy them. I have noticed thatmany girls have clothes from that store, so I tried teasing her. I said, \u201cAll the shirts say \u2018Aero\u2019 on the front. If you arewearing a shirt like that and you have a substitute teacher, and the other girls are all wearing that type of shirt, won\u2019tthe substitute teacher think you are all named \u2018Aero\u2019?\u201dMy daughter replied, in typical 11-year-old fashion, \u201cMom, you are not funny. Can we please go shopping?\u201dI tried a different tactic. I asked Janelle if having clothing from that particular store will make her popular. Shereplied, \u201cNo, it will not make me popular. It is what the popular kids wear. It will make me feel happier.\u201d How can alabel or name brand make someone feel happier? Think back to what you\u2019ve learned about lifespan development.What is it about pre-teens and young teens that make them want to fit in (Figure 12.9)? Does this change over time?Think back to your high school experience, or look around your college campus. What is the main name brandclothing you see? What messages do we get from the media about how to fit in?FIGURE 12.9 Young people struggle to become independent at the same time they are desperately trying to fit inwith their peers. (credit: Monica Arellano-Ongpin)ScriptsBecause of social roles, people tend to know what behavior is expected of them in specific, familiar settings. Ascript is a person\u2019s knowledge about the sequence of events expected in a specific setting (Schank & Abelson,1977). How do you act on the first day of school, when you walk into an elevator, or are at a restaurant?

To an American, saying \u201cpsst\u201d to a server might seem rude, yet to a Brazilian, trying to make eyecontact might not seem an effective strategy. Scripts are important sources of information to guide behavior ingiven situations.

In thesummer of 1971, an advertisement was placed in a California newspaper asking for male volunteers toparticipate in a study about the psychological effects of prison life. More than 70 men volunteered, and thesevolunteers then underwent psychological testing to eliminate candidates who had underlying psychiatricissues, medical issues, or a history of crime or drug abuse. The pool of volunteers was whittled down to 24healthy male college students. Each student was paid $15 per day (equivalent to about $80 today) and wasrandomly assigned to play the role of either a prisoner or a guard in the study. Based on what you have learnedabout research methods, why is it important that participants were randomly assigned?A mock prison was constructed in the basement of the psychology building at Stanford. Participants assignedto play the role of prisoners were \u201carrested\u201d at their homes by Palo Alto police officers, booked at a policestation, and subsequently taken to the mock prison. The experiment was scheduled to run for several weeks.To the surprise of the researchers, both the \u201cprisoners\u201d and \u201cguards\u201d assumed their roles with zeal. On thesecond day of the experiment, the guards forced the prisoners to strip, took their beds, and isolated theringleaders using solitary confinement. In a relatively short time, the guards came to harass the prisoners inan increasingly sadistic manner, through a complete lack of privacy, lack of basic comforts such as mattressesto sleep on, and through degrading chores and late-night counts.The prisoners, in turn, began to show signs of severe anxiety and hopelessness\u2014they began tolerating theguards\u2019 abuse. Even the Stanford professor who designed the study and was the head researcher, PhilipZimbardo, found himself acting as if the prison was real and his role, as prison supervisor, was real as well.After only six days, the experiment had to be ended due to the participants\u2019 deteriorating behavior. Zimbardoexplained,At this point it became clear that we had to end the study. We had created an overwhelmingly powerfulsituation\u2014a situation in which prisoners were withdrawing and behaving in pathological ways, and inwhich some of the guards were behaving sadistically. Even the \u201cgood\u201d guards felt helpless tointervene, and none of the guards quit while the study was in progress. Indeed, it should be noted thatno guard ever came late for his shift, called in sick, left early, or demanded extra pay for overtimework. (Zimbardo, 2013)The Stanford Prison Experiment has been used as a memorable demonstration of the incredible power thatsocial roles, norms, and scripts have in affecting human behavior. However, multiple aspects of the study havebeen subject to criticism since its inception. The nature of these criticisms range from ethical concerns toissues of generalizability (Bartels, Milovich, & Moussier, 2016; Griggs, 2014; Le Texier, 2019). One criticism isthat the way students were recruited for the experiment may have impacted the outcome (Carnahan &McFarland, 2007). Another criticism questions the conclusions that can be drawn from the study. Zimbardoappears to have provided specific guidelines of the types of behaviors that were expected of the guards(Zimbardo, 2007). Subsequent research suggests that such guidelines likely created an expectation of thetypes of behavior that Zimbardo reported observing in the Stanford Prison Experiment (Bartels, 2019), andthat given these expectations, the guards simply acted as they thought they were expected to act. It has alsobeen problematic that attempts to replicate aspects of the study have not been successful. For example, whenno guidelines were presented to the guards, researchers documented different outcomes than those observedby Zimbardo. (Reicher & Haslam, 2006).The Stanford Prison Experiment has some parallels with the abuse of prisoners of war by U.S. Army troops andCIA personnel at the Abu Ghraib prison in 2003 and 2004 during the Iraq War. The offenses at Abu Ghraib weredocumented by photographs of the abuse, some taken by the abusers themselves (Figure 12.10)."

Now weturn to how the power of the situation can influence our attitudes and beliefs. Attitude is our evaluation of aperson, an idea, or an object. We have attitudes for many things ranging from products that we might pick upin the supermarket to people around the world to political policies. Typically, attitudes are favorable orunfavorable: positive or negative (Eagly & Chaiken, 1993). And, they have three components: an affectivecomponent (feelings), a behavioral component (the effect of the attitude on behavior), and a cognitivecomponent (belief and knowledge) (Rosenberg & Hovland, 1960).For example, you may hold a positive attitude toward recycling. This attitude should result in positive feelingstoward recycling (such as \u201cIt makes me feel good to recycle\u201d or \u201cI enjoy knowing that I make a small differencein reducing the amount of waste that ends up in landfills\u201d). Certainly, this attitude should be reflected in ourbehavior: You actually recycle as often as you can. Finally, this attitude will be reflected in favorable thoughts(for example, \u201cRecycling is good for the environment\u201d or \u201cRecycling is the responsible thing to do\u201d).Our attitudes and beliefs are not only influenced by external forces, but also by internal influences that wecontrol. Like our behavior, our attitudes and thoughts are not always changed by situational pressures, but theycan be consciously changed by our own free will. In this section we discuss the conditions under which wewould want to change our own attitudes and beliefs.What is Cognitive Dissonance?Social psychologists have documented that feeling good about ourselves and maintaining positive self-esteemis a powerful motivator of human behavior (Tavris & Aronson, 2008). In the United States, members of thepredominant culture typically think very highly of themselves and view themselves as good people who areabove average on many desirable traits (Ehrlinger, Gilovich, & Ross, 2005).

Psychologist LeonFestinger (1957) defined cognitive dissonance as psychological discomfort arising from holding two or moreinconsistent attitudes, behaviors, or cognitions (thoughts, beliefs, or opinions). Festinger\u2019s theory of cognitivedissonance states that when we experience a conflict in our behaviors, attitudes, or beliefs that runs counter toour positive self-perceptions, we experience psychological discomfort (dissonance). For example, if you believesmoking is bad for your health but you continue to smoke, you experience conflict between your belief andbehavior (Figure 12.11).FIGURE 12.11 Cognitive dissonance is aroused by inconsistent beliefs and behaviors. Believing cigarettes are badfor your health, but smoking cigarettes anyway, can cause cognitive dissonance. To reduce cognitive dissonance,individuals can change their behavior, as in quitting smoking, or change their belief, such as discounting theevidence that smoking is harmful.

Additional research found that dissonance is not only psychologicallyuncomfortable but also can cause physiological arousal (Croyle & Cooper, 1983) and activate regions of thebrain important in emotions and cognitive functioning (van Veen, Krug, Schooler, & Carter, 2009).

We can reduce cognitive dissonance by bringing our cognitions, attitudes, andbehaviors in line\u2014that is, making them harmonious. This can be done in different ways, such as:\u2022 changing our discrepant behavior (e.g., stop smoking),\u2022 changing our cognitions through rationalization or denial (e.g., telling ourselves that health risks can bereduced by smoking filtered cigarettes),\u2022 adding a new cognition (e.g., \u201cSmoking suppresses my appetite so I don\u2019t become overweight, which isgood for my health.\u201d).A classic example of cognitive dissonance is Joaquin, a 20-year-old who enlists in the military. During bootcamp he is awakened at 5:00 a.m., is chronically sleep deprived, yelled at, covered in sand flea bites, physicallybruised and battered, and mentally exhausted (Figure 12.12). It gets worse. Recruits that make it to week 11 ofboot camp have to do 54 hours of continuous training.FIGURE 12.12 A person who has chosen a difficult path must deal with cognitive dissonance in addition to manyother discomforts. (credit: Tyler J. Bolken)Not surprisingly, Joaquin is miserable. No one likes to be miserable. In this type of situation, people canchange their beliefs, their attitudes, or their behaviors. The last option, a change of behaviors, is not availableto Joaquin. He has signed on to the military for four years, and he cannot legally leave.If Joaquin keeps thinking about how miserable he is, it is going to be a very long four years. He will be in aconstant state of cognitive dissonance. As an alternative to this misery, Joaquin can change his beliefs orattitudes. He can tell himself, \u201cI am becoming stronger, healthier, and sharper. I am learning discipline andhow to defend myself and my country. What I am doing is really important.\u201d If this is his belief, he will realizethat he is becoming stronger through his challenges. He then will feel better and not experience cognitivedissonance, which is an uncomfortable state.The Effect of InitiationThe military example demonstrates the observation that a difficult initiation into a group influences us to likethe group more. Another social psychology concept, justification of effort, suggests that we value goals andachievements that we put a lot of effort into. According to this theory, if something is difficult for us to achieve,we believe it is more worthwhile. For example, if you move to an apartment and spend hours assembling adresser you bought from Ikea, you will value that more than a fancier dresser someone else bought you. We donot want to have wasted time and effort to join a group that we eventually leave. A classic experiment byAronson and Mills (1959) demonstrated this justification of effort effect. College students volunteered to join acampus group that would meet regularly to discuss the psychology of sex. Participants were randomlyassigned to one of three conditions: no initiation, an easy initiation, and a difficult initiation into the group.After participating in the first discussion, which was deliberately made very boring, participants rated howmuch they liked the group. Participants who underwent a difficult initiation process to join the group rated thegroup more favorably than did participants with an easy initiation or no initiation (Figure 12.13)."

Students in the difficultinitiation condition liked the group more than students in other conditions due to the justification of effort.Similar effects can be seen in a more recent study of how student effort affects course evaluations. Heckert,Latier, Ringwald-Burton, and Drazen (2006) surveyed 463 undergraduates enrolled in courses at a midwesternuniversity about the amount of effort that their courses required of them. In addition, the students were alsoasked to evaluate various aspects of the course. Given what you\u2019ve just read, it will come as no surprise thatthose courses that were associated with the highest level of effort were evaluated as being more valuable thanthose that did not. Furthermore, students indicated that they learned more in courses that required moreeffort, regardless of the grades that they received in those courses (Heckert et al., 2006).Besides the classic military example and group initiation, can you think of other examples of cognitivedissonance? Here is one: Maria and Marco live in Fairfield County, Connecticut, which is one of the wealthiestareas in the United States and has a very high cost of living. Maria telecommutes from home and Marco doesnot work outside of the home. They rent a very small house for more than $3000 a month. Marco shops atconsignment stores for clothes and economizes when possible. They complain that they never have any moneyand that they cannot buy anything new. When asked why they do not move to a less expensive location, sinceMaria telecommutes, they respond that Fairfield County is beautiful, they love the beaches, and they feelcomfortable there. How does the theory of cognitive dissonance apply to Maria and Marco\u2019s choices?PersuasionIn the previous section we discussed that the motivation to reduce cognitive dissonance leads us to change ourattitudes, behaviors, and/or cognitions to make them consonant. Persuasion is the process of changing ourattitude toward something based on some kind of communication. Much of the persuasion we experiencecomes from outside forces. How do people convince others to change their attitudes, beliefs, and behaviors(Figure 12.14)? What communications do you receive that attempt to persuade you to change your attitudes,beliefs, and behaviors?"

Persuasion is not limited to formaladvertising; we are confronted with it throughout our everyday world. (credit: Robert Couse-Baker)A subfield of social psychology studies persuasion and social influence, providing us with a plethora ofinformation on how humans can be persuaded by others.Yale Attitude Change ApproachThe topic of persuasion has been one of the most extensively researched areas in social psychology (Fiske etal., 2010). During the Second World War, Carl Hovland extensively researched persuasion for the U.S. Army.After the war, Hovland continued his exploration of persuasion at Yale University. Out of this work came amodel called the Yale attitude change approach, which describes the conditions under which people tend tochange their attitudes. Hovland demonstrated that certain features of the source of a persuasive message, thecontent of the message, and the characteristics of the audience will influence the persuasiveness of a message(Hovland, Janis, & Kelley, 1953).Features of the source of the persuasive message include the credibility of the speaker (Hovland & Weiss,1951) and the physical attractiveness of the speaker (Eagly & Chaiken, 1975; Petty, Wegener, & Fabrigar, 1997).Thus, speakers who are credible, or have expertise on the topic, and who are deemed as trustworthy are morepersuasive than less credible speakers. Similarly, more attractive speakers are more persuasive than lessattractive speakers. The use of famous actors and athletes to advertise products on television and in printrelies on this principle. The immediate and long term impact of the persuasion also depends, however, on thecredibility of the messenger (Kumkale & Albarrac\u00edn, 2004).Features of the message itself that affect persuasion include subtlety (the quality of being important, but notobvious) (Petty & Cacioppo, 1986; Walster & Festinger, 1962); sidedness (that is, having more than one side)(Crowley & Hoyer, 1994; Igou & Bless, 2003; Lumsdaine & Janis, 1953); timing (Haugtvedt & Wegener, 1994;Miller & Campbell, 1959), and whether both sides are presented. Messages that are more subtle are morepersuasive than direct messages. Arguments that occur first, such as in a debate, are more influential ifmessages are given back-to-back. However, if there is a delay after the first message, and before the audienceneeds to make a decision, the last message presented will tend to be more persuasive (Miller & Campbell,1959).Features of the audience that affect persuasion are attention (Albarrac\u00edn & Wyer, 2001; Festinger & Maccoby,1964), intelligence, self-esteem (Rhodes & Wood, 1992), and age (Krosnick & Alwin, 1989). In order to bepersuaded, audience members must be paying attention. People with lower intelligence are more easilypersuaded than people with higher intelligence; whereas people with moderate self-esteem are more easilypersuaded than people with higher or lower self-esteem (Rhodes & Wood, 1992). Finally, younger adults aged18\u201325 are more persuadable than older adults."

The elaboration likelihood model considers the variables of the attitudechange approach\u2014that is, features of the source of the persuasive message, contents of the message, andcharacteristics of the audience are used to determine when attitude change will occur. According to theelaboration likelihood model of persuasion, there are two main routes that play a role in delivering apersuasive message: central and peripheral (Figure 12.15).FIGURE 12.15 Persuasion can take one of two paths, and the durability of the end result depends on the path.The central route is logic driven and uses data and facts to convince people of an argument\u2019s worthiness. Forexample, a car company seeking to persuade you to purchase their model will emphasize the car\u2019s safetyfeatures and fuel economy. This is a direct route to persuasion that focuses on the quality of the information. Inorder for the central route of persuasion to be effective in changing attitudes, thoughts, and behaviors, theargument must be strong and, if successful, will result in lasting attitude change.The central route to persuasion works best when the target of persuasion, or the audience, is analytical andwilling to engage in processing of the information. From an advertiser\u2019s perspective, what products would bebest sold using the central route to persuasion? What audience would most likely be influenced to buy theproduct? One example is buying a computer. It is likely, for example, that small business owners might beespecially influenced by the focus on the computer\u2019s quality and features such as processing speed andmemory capacity.The peripheral route is an indirect route that uses peripheral cues to associate positivity with the message(Petty & Cacioppo, 1986). Instead of focusing on the facts and a product\u2019s quality, the peripheral route relies onassociation with positive characteristics such as positive emotions and celebrity endorsement. For example,having a popular athlete advertise athletic shoes is a common method used to encourage young adults topurchase the shoes. This route to attitude change does not require much effort or information processing. Thismethod of persuasion may promote positivity toward the message or product, but it typically results in lesspermanent attitude or behavior change. The audience does not need to be analytical or motivated to processthe message. In fact, a peripheral route to persuasion may not even be noticed by the audience, for example inthe strategy of product placement. Product placement refers to putting a product with a clear brand name orbrand identity in a TV show or movie to promote the product (Gupta & Lord, 1998). For example, one season ofthe reality series American Idolprominently showed the panel of judges drinking out of cups that displayedthe Coca-Cola logo. What other products would be best sold using the peripheral route to persuasion? Anotherexample is clothing: A retailer may focus on celebrities that are wearing the same style of clothing.Foot-in-the-door TechniqueResearchers have tested many persuasion strategies that are effective in selling products and changing"

One effective strategy is the foot-in-the-door technique (Cialdini, 2001;Pliner, Hart, Kohl, & Saari, 1974). Using the foot-in-the-door technique, the persuader gets a person to agreeto bestow a small favor or to buy a small item, only to later request a larger favor or purchase of a bigger item.The foot-in-the-door technique was demonstrated in a study by Freedman and Fraser (1966) in whichparticipants who agreed to a post small sign in their yard or sign a petition were more likely to agree to put alarge sign in their yard than people who declined the first request (Figure 12.16). Research on this techniquealso illustrates the principle of consistency (Cialdini, 2001): Our past behavior often directs our futurebehavior, and we have a desire to maintain consistency once we have committed to a behavior.FIGURE 12.16 With the foot-in-the-door technique, getting someone to agree to a small request such as (a)wearing a campaign button can make them more likely to agree to a larger request, such as (b) putting campaignssigns in your yard. (credit a: modification of work by Joe Crawford; credit b: modification of work by\"shutterblog\"/Flickr)A common application of foot-in-the-door is when teens ask their parents for a small permission (for example,extending curfew by a half hour) and then asking them for something larger. Having granted the smallerrequest increases the likelihood that parents will acquiesce with the later, larger request.How would a store owner use the foot-in-the-door technique to sell you an expensive product? For example,say that you are buying the latest model smartphone, and the salesperson suggests you purchase the best dataplan. You agree to this. The salesperson then suggests a bigger purchase\u2014the three-year extended warranty.After agreeing to the smaller request, you are more likely to also agree to the larger request. You may haveencountered this if you have bought a car. When salespeople realize that a buyer intends to purchase a certainmodel, they might try to get the customer to pay for many or most available options on the car. Anotherexample of the foot-in-the-door technique would be applied to an individual in the market for a used car whodecides to buy a fully loaded new car. Why? Because the salesperson convinced the buyer that they need a carthat has all of the safety features that were not available in the used car."

In one study, a group of participants was shown a series of printed linesegments of different lengths: a, b, and c (Figure 12.17). Participants were then shown a fourth line segment: x.They were asked to identify which line segment from the first group (a, b, or c) most closely resembled thefourth line segment in length.FIGURE 12.17 These line segments illustrate the judgment task in Asch\u2019s conformity study. Which line on theright\u2014a, b, or c\u2014is the same length as line x on the left?Each group of participants had only one true, na\u00efve subject. The remaining members of the group wereconfederates of the researcher. A confederate is a person who is aware of the experiment and works for theresearcher. Confederates are used to manipulate social situations as part of the research design, and the true,na\u00efve participants believe that confederates are, like them, uninformed participants in the experiment. InAsch\u2019s study, the confederates identified a line segment that was obviously shorter than the target line\u2014awrong answer. The na\u00efve participant then had to identify aloud the line segment that best matched the targetline segment.How often do you think the true participant aligned with the confederates\u2019 response? That is, how often do youthink the group influenced the participant, and the participant gave the wrong answer? Asch (1955) found that76% of participants conformed to group pressure at least once by indicating the incorrect line. Conformity isthe change in a person\u2019s behavior to go along with the group, even if he does not agree with the group. Whywould people give the wrong answer? What factors would increase or decrease someone giving in orconforming to group pressure?The Asch effect is the influence of the group majority on an individual\u2019s judgment.What factors make a person more likely to yield to group pressure? Research shows that the size of themajority, the presence of another dissenter, and the public or relatively private nature of responses are keyinfluences on conformity.\u2022 The size of the majority: The greater the number of people in the majority, the more likely an individualwill conform. There is, however, an upper limit: a point where adding more members does not increaseconformity. In Asch\u2019s study, conformity increased with the number of people in the majority\u2014up to sevenindividuals. At numbers beyond seven, conformity leveled off and decreased slightly (Asch, 1955).\u2022 The presence of another dissenter: If there is at least one dissenter, conformity rates drop to near zero(Asch, 1955).\u2022 The public or private nature of the responses: When responses are made publicly (in front of others),conformity is more likely; however, when responses are made privately (e.g., writing down the response),conformity is less likely (Deutsch & Gerard, 1955).The finding that conformity is more likely to occur when responses are public than when they are private is the"

The Ascheffect can be easily seen in children when they have to publicly vote for something. For example, if the teacherasks whether the children would rather have extra recess, no homework, or candy, once a few children vote,the rest will comply and go with the majority. In a different classroom, the majority might vote differently, andmost of the children would comply with that majority. When someone\u2019s vote changes if it is made in publicversus private, this is known as compliance. Compliance can be a form of conformity. Compliance is goingalong with a request or demand, even if you do not agree with the request. In Asch\u2019s studies, the participantscomplied by giving the wrong answers, but privately did not accept that the obvious wrong answers werecorrect.FIGURE 12.18 Voting for government officials in the United States is private to reduce the pressure of conformity.(credit: Nicole Klauss)Now that you have learned about the Asch line experiments, why do you think the participants conformed?The correct answer to the line segment question was obvious, and it was an easy task. Researchers havecategorized the motivation to conform into two types: normative social influence and informational socialinfluence (Deutsch & Gerard, 1955).In normative social influence, people conform to the group norm to fit in, to feel good, and to be accepted bythe group. However, with informational social influence, people conform because they believe the group iscompetent and has the correct information, particularly when the task or situation is ambiguous. What type ofsocial influence was operating in the Asch conformity studies? Since the line judgment task was unambiguous,participants did not need to rely on the group for information. Instead, participants complied to fit in andavoid ridicule, an instance of normative social influence.An example of informational social influence may be what to do in an emergency situation. Imagine that youare in a movie theater watching a film and what seems to be smoke comes in the theater from under theemergency exit door. You are not certain that it is smoke\u2014it might be a special effect for the movie, such as afog machine. When you are uncertain you will tend to look at the behavior of others in the theater. If otherpeople show concern and get up to leave, you are likely to do the same. However, if others seem unconcerned,you are likely to stay put and continue watching the movie (Figure 12.19)."

Many students say they would notconform, that the study is outdated, and that people nowadays are more independent. To some extent this maybe true. Research suggests that overall rates of conformity may have reduced since the time of Asch\u2019s research.Furthermore, efforts to replicate Asch\u2019s study have made it clear that many factors determine how likely it isthat someone will demonstrate conformity to the group. These factors include the participant\u2019s age, gender,and socio-cultural background (Bond & Smith, 1996; Larsen, 1990; Walker & Andrade, 1996).LINK TO LEARNINGWatch this video of a replication of the Asch experiment (http://openstax.org/l/Asch2) to learn more.Stanley Milgram\u2019s ExperimentConformity is one effect of the influence of others on our thoughts, feelings, and behaviors. Another form ofsocial influence is obedience to authority. Obedience is the change of an individual\u2019s behavior to comply with ademand by an authority figure. People often comply with the request because they are concerned about aconsequence if they do not comply. To demonstrate this phenomenon, we review another classic socialpsychology experiment.Stanley Milgram was a social psychology professor at Yale who was influenced by the trial of Adolf Eichmann, aNazi war criminal. Eichmann\u2019s defense for the atrocities he committed was that he was \u201cjust following orders.\u201dMilgram (1963) wanted to test the validity of this defense, so he designed an experiment and initially recruited40 men for his experiment. The volunteer participants were led to believe that they were participating in astudy to improve learning and memory. The participants were told that they were to teach other students(learners) correct answers to a series of test items. The participants were shown how to use a device that theywere told delivered electric shocks of different intensities to the learners. The participants were told to shockthe learners if they gave a wrong answer to a test item\u2014that the shock would help them to learn. Theparticipants believed they gave the learners shocks, which increased in 15-volt increments, all the way up to450 volts. The participants did not know that the learners were confederates and that the confederates did notactually receive shocks.In response to a string of incorrect answers from the learners, the participants obediently and repeatedlyshocked them. The confederate learners cried out for help, begged the participant teachers to stop, and evencomplained of heart trouble. Yet, when the researcher told the participant-teachers to continue the shock, 65%of the participants continued the shock to the maximum voltage and to the point that the learner becameunresponsive (Figure 12.20). What makes someone obey authority to the point of potentially causing seriousharm to another person?"

Two out ofthree (65%) participants continued to administer shocks to an unresponsive learner.Several variations of the original Milgram experiment were conducted to test the boundaries of obedience.When certain features of the situation were changed, participants were less likely to continue to deliver shocks(Milgram, 1965). For example, when the setting of the experiment was moved to an off-campus office building,the percentage of participants who delivered the highest shock dropped to 48%. When the learner was in thesame room as the teacher, the highest shock rate dropped to 40%. When the teachers\u2019 and learners\u2019 handswere touching, the highest shock rate dropped to 30%. When the researcher gave the orders by phone, the ratedropped to 23%. These variations show that when the humanity of the person being shocked was increased,obedience decreased. Similarly, when the authority of the experimenter decreased, so did obedience.This case is still very applicable today. What does a person do if an authority figure orders something done?What if the person believes it is incorrect, or worse, unethical? In a study by Martin and Bull (2008), midwivesprivately filled out a questionnaire regarding best practices and expectations in delivering a baby. Then, amore senior midwife and supervisor asked the junior midwives to do something they had previously statedthey were opposed to. Most of the junior midwives were obedient to authority, going against their own beliefs.Burger (2009) partially replicated this study. He found among a multicultural sample of women and men thattheir levels of obedience matched Milgram's research. Doli\u0144ski et al. (2017) performed a replication ofBurger's work in Poland and controlled for the gender of both participants and learners, and once again,results that were consistent with Milgram's original work were observed.GroupthinkWhen in group settings, we are often influenced by the thoughts, feelings, and behaviors of people around us.Whether it is due to normative or informational social influence, groups have power to influence individuals.Another phenomenon of group conformity is groupthink. Groupthink is the modification of the opinions ofmembers of a group to align with what they believe is the group consensus (Janis, 1972). In group situations,the group often takes action that individuals would not perform outside the group setting because groupsmake more extreme decisions than individuals do. Moreover, groupthink can hinder opposing trains ofthought. This elimination of diverse opinions contributes to faulty decision by the group.Groupthink in the U.S. GovernmentThere have been several instances of groupthink in the U.S. government.

This invasion occurred because a smallgroup of advisors and former President George W. Bush were convinced that Iraq represented a significantterrorism threat with a large stockpile of weapons of mass destruction at its disposal. Although some of theseindividuals may have had some doubts about the credibility of the information available to them at the time, inthe end, the group arrived at a consensus that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction and represented asignificant threat to national security. It later came to light that Iraq did not have weapons of mass destruction,but not until the invasion was well underway. As a result, 6000 American soldiers were killed and many morecivilians died. How did the Bush administration arrive at their conclusions? View this video of Colin Powell, 10years after his famous United Nations speech, discussing the information he had at the time(https://www.openstax.org/l/GroupThink) that his decisions were based on. (\"CNN Official Interview: ColinPowell now regrets UN speech about WMDs,\" 2010).Do you see evidence of groupthink?Why does groupthink occur? There are several causes of groupthink, which makes it preventable. When thegroup is highly cohesive, or has a strong sense of connection, maintaining group harmony may become moreimportant to the group than making sound decisions. If the group leader is directive and makes his opinionsknown, this may discourage group members from disagreeing with the leader. If the group is isolated fromhearing alternative or new viewpoints, groupthink may be more likely. How do you know when groupthink isoccurring?There are several symptoms of groupthink including the following:\u2022 perceiving the group as invulnerable or invincible\u2014believing it can do no wrong\u2022 believing the group is morally correct\u2022 self-censorship by group members, such as withholding information to avoid disrupting the groupconsensusthe quashing of dissenting group members\u2019 opinionsthe shielding of the group leader from dissenting views\u2022\u2022\u2022 perceiving an illusion of unanimity among group members\u2022 holding stereotypes or negative attitudes toward the out-group or others\u2019 with differing viewpoints (Janis,1972)Given the causes and symptoms of groupthink, how can it be avoided? There are several strategies that canimprove group decision making including seeking outside opinions, voting in private, having the leaderwithhold position statements until all group members have voiced their views, conducting research on allviewpoints, weighing the costs and benefits of all options, and developing a contingency plan (Janis, 1972;Mitchell & Eckstein, 2009).Group PolarizationAnother phenomenon that occurs within group settings is group polarization. Group polarization (Teger &Pruitt, 1967) is the strengthening of an original group attitude after the discussion of views within a group.That is, if a group initially favors a viewpoint, after discussion the group consensus is likely a strongerendorsement of the viewpoint. Conversely, if the group was initially opposed to a viewpoint, group discussionwould likely lead to stronger opposition. Group polarization explains many actions taken by groups that wouldnot be undertaken by individuals. Group polarization can be observed at political conventions, when platformsof the party are supported by individuals who, when not in a group, would decline to support them. Recently,some theorists have argued that group polarization may be partly responsible for the extreme politicalpartisanship that seems ubiquitous in modern society. Given that people can self-select media outlets that aremost consistent with their own political views, they are less likely to encounter opposing viewpoints. Overtime, this leads to a strengthening of their own perspective and of hostile attitudes and behaviors towards"

Remarkably, political polarization leads to open levels of discriminationthat are on par with, or perhaps exceed, racial discrimination (Iyengar & Westwood, 2015). A more everydayexample is a group\u2019s discussion of how attractive someone is. Does your opinion change if you find someoneattractive, but your friends do not agree? If your friends vociferously agree, might you then find this personeven more attractive?Social traps refer to situations that arise when individuals or groups of individuals behave in ways that are notin their best interest and that may have negative, long-term consequences. However, once established, a socialtrap is very difficult to escape. For example, following World War II, the United States and the former SovietUnion engaged in a nuclear arms race. While the presence of nuclear weapons is not in either party's bestinterest, once the arms race began, each country felt the need to continue producing nuclear weapons toprotect itself from the other.Social LoafingImagine you were just assigned a group project with other students whom you barely know. Everyone in yourgroup will get the same grade. Are you the type who will do most of the work, even though the final grade willbe shared? Or are you more likely to do less work because you know others will pick up the slack? Socialloafing involves a reduction in individual output on tasks where contributions are pooled. Because eachindividual's efforts are not evaluated, individuals can become less motivated to perform well. Karau andWilliams (1993) and Simms and Nichols (2014) reviewed the research on social loafing and discerned when itwas least likely to happen. The researchers noted that social loafing could be alleviated if, among othersituations, individuals knew their work would be assessed by a manager (in a workplace setting) or instructor(in a classroom setting), or if a manager or instructor required group members to complete self-evaluations.The likelihood of social loafing in student work groups increases as the size of the group increases (Shepperd &Taylor, 1999). According to Kamau and Williams (1993), college students were the population most likely toengage in social loafing. Their study also found that women and participants from collectivistic cultures wereless likely to engage in social loafing, explaining that their group orientation may account for this.College students could work around social loafing or \u201cfree-riding\u201d by suggesting to their professors use of aflocking method to form groups. Harding (2018) compared groups of students who had self-selected intogroups for class to those who had been formed by flocking, which involves assigning students to groups whohave similar schedules and motivations. Not only did she find that students reported less \u201cfree riding,\u201d but thatthey also did better in the group assignments compared to those whose groups were self-selected.Interestingly, the opposite of social loafing occurs when the task is complex and difficult (Bond & Titus, 1983;Geen, 1989). In a group setting, such as the student work group, if your individual performance cannot beevaluated, there is less pressure for you to do well, and thus less anxiety or physiological arousal (Latan\u00e9,Williams, & Harkens, 1979). This puts you in a relaxed state in which you can perform your best, if you choose(Zajonc, 1965). If the task is a difficult one, many people feel motivated and believe that their group needs theirinput to do well on a challenging project (Jackson & Williams, 1985).DeindividuationAnother way that being part of a group can affect behavior is exhibited in instances in which deindividuationoccurs. Deindividuation refers to situations in which a person may feel a sense of anonymity and therefore areduction in accountability and sense of self when among others. Deindividuation is often pointed to in casesin which mob or riot-like behaviors occur (Zimbardo, 1969), but research on the subject and the role thatdeindividuation plays in such behaviors has resulted in inconsistent results (as discussed in Granstr\u00f6m, Guv\u00e5,Hylander, & Rosander, 2009).Table 12.2 summarizes the types of social influence you have learned about in this chapter."

(credit b: modification of workby United States Farm Security Administration)Understanding Prejudice and DiscriminationAs we discussed in the opening story of Trayvon Martin, humans are very diverse and although we share manysimilarities, we also have many differences. The social groups we belong to help form our identities (Tajfel,1974). These differences may be difficult for some people to reconcile, which may lead to prejudice towardpeople who are different. Prejudice is a negative attitude and feeling toward an individual based solely onone\u2019s membership in a particular social group (Allport, 1954; Brown, 2010). Prejudice is common againstpeople who are members of an unfamiliar cultural group. Thus, certain types of education, contact,interactions, and building relationships with members of different cultural groups can reduce the tendencytoward prejudice. In fact, simply imagining interacting with members of different cultural groups might affectprejudice. Indeed, when experimental participants were asked to imagine themselves positively interactingwith someone from a different group, this led to an increased positive attitude toward the other group and anincrease in positive traits associated with the other group. Furthermore, imagined social interaction canreduce anxiety associated with inter-group interactions (Crisp & Turner, 2009). What are some examples ofsocial groups that you belong to that contribute to your identity? Social groups can include gender, race,ethnicity, nationality, social class, religion, sexual orientation, profession, and many more. And, as is true forsocial roles, you can simultaneously be a member of more than one social group. An example of prejudice ishaving a negative attitude toward people who are not born in the United States. Although people holding thisprejudiced attitude do not know all people who were not born in the United States, they dislike them due totheir status as foreigners.Can you think of a prejudiced attitude you have held toward a group of people? How did your prejudicedevelop? Prejudice often begins in the form of a stereotype\u2014that is, a specific belief or assumption aboutindividuals based solely on their membership in a group, regardless of their individual characteristics.Stereotypes become overgeneralized and applied to all members of a group. For example, someone holdingprejudiced attitudes toward older adults, may believe that older adults are slow and incompetent (Cuddy,Norton, & Fiske, 2005; Nelson, 2004). We cannot possibly know each individual person of advanced age toknow that all older adults are slow and incompetent. Therefore, this negative belief is overgeneralized to allmembers of the group, even though many of the individual group members may in fact be spry and intelligent.Another example of a well-known stereotype involves beliefs about racial differences among athletes. AsHodge, Burden, Robinson, and Bennett (2008) point out, Black athletes are often believed to be more athletic,yet less intelligent, than their White counterparts. These beliefs persist despite a number of high profileexamples to the contrary. Sadly, such beliefs often influence how these athletes are treated by others and howthey view themselves and their own capabilities. Whether or not you agree with a stereotype, stereotypes aregenerally well-known within a given culture (Devine, 1989).Sometimes people will act on their prejudiced attitudes toward a group of people, and this behavior is knownas discrimination. Discrimination is negative action toward an individual as a result of one\u2019s membership in aparticular group (Allport, 1954; Dovidio & Gaertner, 2004). As a result of holding negative beliefs (stereotypes)and negative attitudes (prejudice) about a particular group, people often treat the target of prejudice poorly,such as excluding older adults from their circle of friends. In this way, discrimination is a form of oppression.An example of a psychologist experiencing gender discrimination is found in the life and studies of MaryWhiton Calkins. Calkins was given special permission to attend graduate seminars at Harvard (at that time inthe late 1880s, Harvard did not accept women) and at one point was the sole student of the famouspsychologist William James. She passed all the requirements needed for a PhD and was described bypsychologist Hugo M\u00fcnsterberg as \u201cone of the strongest professors of psychology in this country.\u201d However,Harvard refused to grant Calkins a PhD because she was a woman (Harvard University, 2019).

However, it is important to also point out thatpeople can hold positive thoughts, feelings, and behaviors toward individuals based on group membership; forexample, they would show preferential treatment for people who are like themselves\u2014that is, who share thesame gender, race, or favorite sports team.LINK TO LEARNINGWatch this video of a social experiment conducted in a park (http://openstax.org/l/racismexp) thatdemonstrates the concepts of prejudice, stereotypes, and discrimination. In the video, three people try to steala bike out in the open. The race and gender of the thief is varied: a White male teenager, a Black male teenager,and a White female. Does anyone try to stop them? The treatment of the teenagers in the video demonstratesthe concept of racism.Prejudice and DiscriminationWhen we meet strangers we automatically process three pieces of information about them: their race, gender,and age (Ito & Urland, 2003). Why are these aspects of an unfamiliar person so important? Why don\u2019t weinstead notice whether their eyes are friendly, whether they are smiling, their height, the type of clothes theyare wearing? Although these secondary characteristics are important in forming a first impression of astranger, the social categories of race, gender, and age provide a wealth of information about an individual.This information, however, often is based on stereotypes. We may have different expectations of strangersdepending on their race, gender, and age.

For example, Black people are significantly more likely tohave their vehicles searched during traffic stops than White people, particularly when Black people are drivingin predominately White neighborhoods, a phenomenon often termed \u201cDWB\u201d or \u201cdriving while Black\u201d (Rojek,Rosenfeld, & Decker, 2012).Mexican Americans and other Latino groups also are targets of racism from the police and other members ofthe community. For example, when purchasing items with a personal check, Latino shoppers are more likelythan White shoppers to be asked to show formal identification (Dovidio et al., 2010).In one case of alleged harassment by the police, several East Haven, Connecticut, police officers were arrestedon federal charges due to reportedly continued harassment and brutalization of Latinos. When the accusationscame out, the mayor of East Haven was asked, \u201cWhat are you doing for the Latino community today?\u201d TheMayor responded, \u201cI might have tacos when I go home, I\u2019m not quite sure yet\u201d (\u201cEast Haven Mayor,\u201d 2012). Thisstatement undermines the important issue of racial profiling and police harassment of Latinos, while belittlingLatino culture by emphasizing an interest in a food product stereotypically associated with Latinos.Racism is prevalent toward many other groups in the United States including Native Americans, ArabAmericans, Jewish Americans, and Asian Americans. Have you experienced or witnessed racism toward any ofthese racial or ethnic groups? Are you aware of racism in your community?One reason modern forms of racism, and prejudice in general, are hard to detect is related to the dual attitudesmodel (Wilson, Lindsey, & Schooler, 2000). Humans have two forms of attitudes: explicit attitudes, which areconscious and controllable, and implicit attitudes, which are unconscious and uncontrollable (Devine, 1989;Olson & Fazio, 2003). Because holding egalitarian views is socially desirable (Plant & Devine, 1998), mostpeople do not show extreme racial bias or other prejudices on measures of their explicit attitudes. However,measures of implicit attitudes often show evidence of mild to strong racial bias or other prejudices (Greenwald,McGee, & Schwartz, 1998; Olson & Fazio, 2003).SexismSexism is prejudice and discrimination toward individuals based on their sex. Typically, sexism takes the formof men holding biases against women, but anyone can show sexism toward their own or the other sex. Likeracism, sexism may be subtle and difficult to detect. Common forms of sexism in modern society includegender role expectations, such as expecting women to be the caretakers of the household. Sexism also includespeople\u2019s expectations for how members of a gender group should behave. For example, women are expected tobe friendly, passive, and nurturing, and when women behave in an unfriendly, assertive, or neglectful mannerthey often are disliked for violating their gender role (Rudman, 1998). Research by Laurie Rudman (1998) findsthat when female job applicants self-promote, they are likely to be viewed as competent, but they may bedisliked and are less likely to be hired because they violated gender expectations for modesty. In this way,women are sometimes blamed for wage and employment inequality, but they would be viewed negatively fortrying to overcome them, a phenomenon sometimes referred to as the double bind. Sexism can exist on asocietal level such as in hiring, employment opportunities, and education. Women are less likely to be hired orpromoted in male-dominated professions such as engineering, aviation, and construction (Figure 12.22) (Blau,Ferber, & Winkler, 2010; Ceci & Williams, 2011). Have you ever experienced or witnessed sexism? Think aboutyour family members\u2019 jobs or careers. Why do you think there are differences in the jobs women and menhave, such as more women nurses but more male surgeons (Betz, 2008)?"

(credit: \"The National Guard\"/Flickr)AgeismPeople often form judgments and hold expectations about people based on their age. These judgments andexpectations can lead to ageism, or prejudice and discrimination toward individuals based solely on their age.Think of expectations you hold for older adults. How could someone\u2019s expectations influence the feelings theyhold toward individuals from older age groups? Ageism is widespread in U.S. culture (Nosek, 2005), and acommon ageist attitude toward older adults is that they are incompetent, physically weak, and slow(Greenberg, Schimel, & Martens, 2002) and some people consider older adults less attractive. Chang, Kannoth,Levy, Wang, Lee, and Levy (2020) reported on relationships between ageism and health outcomes over a40-year-plus period from countries around the world. Across 11 health domains, people over 50 were likely toexperience ageism most often in the form of being denied access to health services and work opportunities.Some cultures, however, including some Asian, Latino, and African American cultures, both outside and withinthe United States afford older adults respect and honor.Typically, ageism occurs against older adults, but ageism also can occur toward younger adults. Whatexpectations do you hold toward younger people? Does society expect younger adults to be immature andirresponsible? Are younger generations seen as having it too easy or having weaker characters than oldergenerations? Raymer, Reed, Spiegel, and Purvanova (2017) examined ageism against younger workers. Theyfound that older workers endorsed negative stereotypes of younger workers, believing that they had more workdeficit characteristics (including perceptions of incompetence). How might these forms of ageism affect ayounger and older adult who are applying for a sales clerk position?Homophobia and TransphobiaAnother form of prejudice is homophobia: an umbrella term referring to prejudice and discrimination ofindividuals based solely on their sexual orientation, which is often applied to bisexual, lesbian, gay, and othernon-heterosexual people. Transphobia is the hatred or fear of those who are perceived to break or blurstereotypical gender roles, often expressed as stereotyping, discrimination, harassment and/or violence. Likeageism, homophobia is a widespread prejudice in U.S. society that is tolerated by many people (Herek &McLemore, 2013; Nosek, 2005). Negative feelings often result in discrimination, such as the exclusion oflesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and queer (LGBTQ+) people from social groups and the avoidance ofLGBTQ+ neighbors and co-workers. This discrimination also extends to employers deliberately declining tohire qualified LGBTQ+ job applicants, a practice officially outlawed by a 2020 Surpreme Court decision butwhich remains a significant issue. Have you experienced or witnessed homophobia? If so, what stereotypes,prejudiced attitudes, and discrimination were evident?"

In some cases, peoplehave been tortured and/or murdered simply because they were not straight. This passionate response has ledsome researchers to question what motives might exist for homophobic people. Adams, Wright, & Lohr (1996)conducted a study investigating this issue and their results were quite an eye-opener.In this experiment, male college students were given a scale that assessed how homophobic they were; thosewith extreme scores were recruited to participate in the experiment. In the end, 64 men agreed to participateand were split into 2 groups: homophobic men and nonhomophobic men. Both groups of men were fitted with apenile plethysmograph, an instrument that measures changes in blood flow to the penis and serves as anobjective measurement of sexual arousal.All men were shown segments of sexually explicit videos. One of these videos involved a sexual interactionbetween a man and a woman (straight clip). One video displayed two females engaged in a sexual interaction(lesbian clip), and the final video displayed two men engaged in a sexual interaction (gay clip). Changes in peniletumescence (a measure of physiological genital arousal) were recorded during all three clips, and a subjectivemeasurement of sexual arousal was also obtained. While both groups of men became sexually aroused to thestraight and lesbian video clips, only those men who were identified as homophobic showed sexual arousal tothe gay male video clip. While all men reported that their erections indicated arousal for the straight and lesbianclips, the homophobic men indicated that they were not sexually aroused (despite their erections) to the gayclips. Adams et al. (1996) suggest that these findings may indicate that homophobia is related to gay arousal thatthe homophobic individuals either deny or are unaware.Why Do Prejudice and Discrimination Exist?Prejudice and discrimination persist in society due to social learning and conformity to social norms. Childrenlearn prejudiced attitudes and beliefs from society: their parents, teachers, friends, the media, and othersources of socialization, such as social media (O\u2019Keeffe & Clarke-Pearson, 2011). If certain types of prejudiceand discrimination are acceptable in a society, there may be normative pressures to conform and share thoseprejudiced beliefs, attitudes, and behaviors. For example, public and private schools are still somewhatsegregated by social class. Historically, only children from wealthy families could afford to attend privateschools, whereas children from middle- and low-income families typically attended public schools. If a childfrom a low-income family received a merit scholarship to attend a private school, how might the child betreated by classmates? Can you recall a time when you held prejudiced attitudes or beliefs or acted in adiscriminatory manner because your group of friends expected you to?Stereotypes and Self-Fulfilling ProphecyWhen we hold a stereotype about a person, we have expectations that they will fulfill that stereotype. A self-fulfilling prophecy is an expectation held by a person that alters their behavior in a way that tends to make ittrue. When we hold stereotypes about a person, we tend to treat the person according to our expectations. Thistreatment can influence the person to act according to our stereotypic expectations, thus confirming ourstereotypic beliefs. Research by Rosenthal and Jacobson (1968) found that disadvantaged students whoseteachers expected them to perform well had higher grades than disadvantaged students whose teachersexpected them to do poorly.Consider this example of cause and effect in a self-fulfilling prophecy: If an employer expects an openly gay jobapplicant to be incompetent, the potential employer might treat the applicant negatively during the interviewby engaging in less conversation, making little eye contact, and generally behaving coldly toward the applicant"

In turn, the job applicant will perceive that the potential employerdislikes him, and he will respond by giving shorter responses to interview questions, making less eye contact,and generally disengaging from the interview. After the interview, the employer will reflect on the applicant\u2019sbehavior, which seemed cold and distant, and the employer will conclude, based on the applicant\u2019s poorperformance during the interview, that the applicant was in fact incompetent. Thus, the employer\u2019sstereotype\u2014gay people are incompetent and do not make good employees\u2014is reinforced. Do you think this jobapplicant is likely to be hired? Treating individuals according to stereotypic beliefs can lead to prejudice anddiscrimination.Another dynamic that can reinforce stereotypes is confirmation bias. When interacting with the target of ourprejudice, we tend to pay attention to information that is consistent with our stereotypic expectations andignore information that is inconsistent with our expectations. In this process, known as confirmation bias, weseek out information that supports our stereotypes and ignore information that is inconsistent with ourstereotypes (Wason & Johnson-Laird, 1972). In the job interview example, the employer may not have noticedthat the job applicant was friendly and engaging, and that he provided competent responses to the interviewquestions in the beginning of the interview. Instead, the employer focused on the job applicant\u2019s performancein the later part of the interview, after the applicant changed his demeanor and behavior to match theinterviewer\u2019s negative treatment. Have you ever fallen prey to the self-fulfilling prophecy or confirmation bias,either as the source or target of such bias? How might we stop the cycle of the self-fulfilling prophecy?In-Groups and Out-GroupsAs discussed previously in this section, we all belong to a gender, race, age, and social economic group. Thesegroups provide a powerful source of our identity and self-esteem (Tajfel & Turner, 1979). These groups serve asour in-groups. An in-group is a group that we identify with or see ourselves as belonging to. A group that wedon\u2019t belong to, or an out-group, is a group that we view as fundamentally different from us. For example, ifyou are a woman, your gender in-group includes all women, and your gender out-group includes all men(Figure 12.23). People often view gender groups as being fundamentally different from each other inpersonality traits, characteristics, social roles, and interests. Because we often feel a strong sense of belongingand emotional connection to our in-groups, we develop in-group bias: a preference for our own group overother groups. This in-group bias can result in prejudice and discrimination because the out-group isperceived as different and is less preferred than our in-group.FIGURE 12.23 These children are very young, but they are already aware of their gender in-group and out-group.(credit: modification of work by \"Reiner Kraft\"/Flickr)Despite the group dynamics that seem only to push groups toward conflict, there are forces that promotereconciliation between groups: the expression of empathy, of acknowledgment of past suffering on both sides,and the halt of destructive behaviors."

People can work together to achieve great things,such as helping each other in difficult times: consider how educators and healthcare workers went to greatlengths to help others during the COVID-19 pandemic. People also can do great harm to one another, such asconforming to group norms that are immoral and obeying authority to the point of murder: consider the massconformity of Nazis during WWII. In this section we will discuss a negative side of humanbehavior\u2014aggression.A number of researchers have explored ways to reduce prejudice. One of the earliest was a study by Sherif et al.(1961) known as the Robbers Cave experiment. They found that when two opposing groups at a camp workedtogether toward a common goal, prejudicial attitudes between the groups decreased (Gaertner, Dovidio,Banker, Houlette, Johnson, & McGlynn, 2000). Focusing on superordinate goals was the key to attitude changein the research. Another study examined the jigsaw classroom, a technique designed by Aronson andBridgeman in an effort to increase success in desegregated classrooms. In this technique, students work on anassignment in groups inclusive of various races and abilities. They are assigned tasks within their group, thencollaborate with peers from other groups who were assigned the same task, and then report back to theiroriginal group. Walker and Crogan (1998) noted that the jigsaw classroom reduced potential for prejudice inAustralia, as diverse students worked together on projects needing all of the pieces to succeed. This researchsuggests that anything that can allow individuals to work together toward common goals can decreaseprejudicial attitudes. Obviously, the application of such strategies in real-world settings would enhanceopportunities for conflict resolution.AggressionHumans engage in aggression when they seek to cause harm or pain to another person. Aggression takes twoforms depending on one\u2019s motives: hostile or instrumental. Hostile aggression is motivated by feelings ofanger with intent to cause pain; a fight in a bar with a stranger is an example of hostile aggression. In contrast,instrumental aggression is motivated by achieving a goal and does not necessarily involve intent to causepain (Berkowitz, 1993); a contract killer who murders for hire displays instrumental aggression.There are many different theories as to why aggression exists. Some researchers argue that aggression servesan evolutionary function (Buss, 2004). Men are more likely than women to show aggression (Wilson & Daly,1985). From the perspective of evolutionary psychology, human male aggression, like that in nonhumanprimates, likely serves to display dominance over other males, both to protect a mate and to perpetuate themale\u2019s genes (Figure 12.24). Sexual jealousy is part of male aggression; males endeavor to make sure theirmates are not copulating with other males, thus ensuring their own paternity of the female\u2019s offspring.Although aggression provides an obvious evolutionary advantage for men, women also engage in aggression.Women typically display more indirect forms of aggression, with their aggression serving as a means to an end(Dodge & Schwartz, 1997). For example, women may express their aggression covertly by communication that"

Another theory that explains one of the functions of humanaggression is frustration aggression theory (Dollard, Doob, Miller, Mowrer, & Sears, 1939). This theory statesthat when humans are prevented from achieving an important goal, they become frustrated and aggressive.FIGURE 12.24 Human males and nonhuman male primates endeavor to gain and display dominance over othermales, as demonstrated in the behavior of these monkeys. (credit: \u201cArcadiu\u0161\u201d/Flickr)BullyingAnother form of aggression is bullying. As you learn in your study of child development, socializing andplaying with other children is beneficial for children\u2019s psychological development. However, as you may haveexperienced as a child, not all play behavior has positive outcomes. Some children are aggressive and want toplay roughly. Other children are selfish and do not want to share toys. One form of negative social interactionsamong children that has become a national concern is bullying. Bullying is repeated negative treatment ofanother person, often an adolescent, over time (Olweus, 1993). A one-time incident in which one child hitsanother child on the playground would not be considered bullying: Bullying is repeated behavior. The negativetreatment typical in bullying is the attempt to inflict harm, injury, or humiliation, and bullying can includephysical or verbal attacks. However, bullying doesn\u2019t have to be physical or verbal, it can be psychological.Research finds gender differences in how girls and boys bully others (American Psychological Association,2010; Olweus, 1993). Boys tend to engage in direct, physical aggression such as physically harming others.Girls tend to engage in indirect, social forms of aggression such as spreading rumors, ignoring, or sociallyisolating others. Based on what you have learned about child development and social roles, why do you thinkboys and girls display different types of bullying behavior?Bullying involves three parties: the bully, the victim, and witnesses or bystanders. The act of bullying involvesan imbalance of power with the bully holding more power\u2014physically, emotionally, and/or socially over thevictim. The experience of bullying can be positive for the bully, who may enjoy a boost to self-esteem. However,there are several negative consequences of bullying for the victim, and also for the bystanders. How do youthink bullying negatively impacts adolescents? Being the victim of bullying is associated with decreasedmental health, including experiencing anxiety and depression (APA, 2010). Victims of bullying mayunderperform in schoolwork (Bowen, 2011). Bullying also can result in the victim dying by suicide (APA,2010). How might bullying negatively affect witnesses?Although there is not one single personality profile for who becomes a bully and who becomes a victim ofbullying (APA, 2010), researchers have identified some patterns in children who are at a greater risk of beingbullied (Olweus, 1993):\u2022 Children who are emotionally reactive are at a greater risk for being bullied. Bullies may be attracted tochildren who get upset easily because the bully can quickly get an emotional reaction from them.\u2022 Children who are different from others are likely to be targeted for bullying. Children who are overweight,cognitively impaired, or racially or ethnically different from their peer group may be at higher risk.\u2022 Gay, lesbian, bisexual, and transgender teens are at very high risk of being bullied and hurt due to theirsexual orientation."

Cyberbullying, like bullying, is repeated behavior that is intended to cause psychological oremotional harm to another person. What is unique about cyberbullying is that it is typically covert, concealed,done in private, and the bully can remain anonymous. This anonymity gives the bully power, and the victimmay feel helpless, unable to escape the harassment, and unable to retaliate (Spears, Slee, Owens, & Johnson,2009). About one in three middle and high school students report that they have experienced cyberbullying(Patchin, 2016; Patchin, 2019), with some studies indicating that nearly three in five teens have experiencedsome type of online abusive behavior such as non-repeated name-calling or being sent unsolicited links orimages (Anderson, 2018).Cyberbullying can take many forms, including harassing a victim by spreading rumors, creating a websitedefaming the victim, threatening the victim, or teasing the victim (Spears et al., 2009). Overall, LGBTQ youthare targeted at a higher rate than heterosexual and cisgender youth, and members of minority populationsoverall are more likely to be cyberbullying victims (Hinjuda & Patchin, 2020). In terms of gender, experiencesvary in terms of both the prevelance and types of cyberbullying experienced and perpetrated. In cyberbullying,it is more common for girls to be the bullies and victims. Interestingly, girls who become cyberbullies oftenhave been the victims of cyberbullying at one time (Vandebosch & Van Cleemput, 2009). Girls were more likelyto say someone spread rumors about them online while boys were more likely to say that someone threatenedto hurt them online (Patchin, 2019). The effects of cyberbullying are just as harmful as traditional bullying andinclude the victim feeling frustration, anger, sadness, helplessness, powerlessness, and fear. Victims will alsoexperience lower self-esteem (Hoff & Mitchell, 2009; Spears et al., 2009). Furthermore, recent researchsuggests that both cyberbullying victims and perpetrators are more likely to experience suicidal ideation, andthey are more likely to attempt suicide than individuals who have no experience with cyberbullying (John,2019). Cyberbullying is a form of aggression and, depending on the messages and methods, can be consideredharassment, stalking, or assault\u2014all subject to prosecution. Finally, while much of the concern and researchregarding cyberbullying centers on adolescents, adults (particularly college students) are frequent victims andperpetrators. What features of technology make cyberbullying easier and perhaps more accessible to youngadults? What can parents, teachers, and social networking websites do to prevent cyberbullying?FIGURE 12.25 Cyberbullying can create a feeling of powerlessness and inescapability because victimization is notconstrained to physical locations. Many victims report being harassed across multiple platforms or formats at thesame time. (credit: Steven Depolo)The Bystander EffectThe discussion of bullying highlights the problem of witnesses not intervening to help a victim. ResearchersLatan\u00e9 and Darley (1968) described a phenomenon called the bystander effect. The bystander effect is aphenomenon in which a witness or bystander does not volunteer to help a victim or person in distress. Instead,they just watch what is happening. Social psychologists hold that we make these decisions based on the socialsituation, not our own personality variables. The impetus behind the bystander effect was the murder of ayoung woman named Kitty Genovese in 1964. The story of her tragic death took on a life of its own when it wasreported that none of her neighbors helped her or called the police when she was being attacked. However,"

Not only did bystanders indeed intervene in her murder (one man whoshouted at the killer, a woman who said she called the police, and a friend who comforted her in her lastmoments), but other bystanders intervened in the capture of the murderer. Social psychologists claim thatdiffusion of responsibility is the likely explanation. Diffusion of responsibility is the tendency for no one in agroup to help because the responsibility to help is spread throughout the group (Bandura, 1999). Becausethere were many witnesses to the attack on Genovese, as evidenced by the number of lit apartment windows inthe building, individuals assumed someone else must have already called the police. The responsibility to callthe police was diffused across the number of witnesses to the crime. Have you ever passed an accident on thefreeway and assumed that a victim or certainly another motorist has already reported the accident? In general,the greater the number of bystanders, the less likely any one person will help."

What makes people like each other? With whom are we friends?Whom do we date? Researchers have documented several features of the situation that influence whether weform relationships with others. There are also universal traits that humans find attractive in others. In thissection we discuss conditions that make forming relationships more likely, what we look for in friendships andromantic relationships, the different types of love, and a theory explaining how our relationships are formed,maintained, and terminated.Prosocial Behavior and AltruismDo you voluntarily help others? Voluntary behavior with the intent to help other people is called prosocialbehavior. Why do people help other people? Is personal benefit such as feeling good about oneself the onlyreason people help one another? Research suggests there are many other reasons. Altruism is people\u2019s desireto help others even if the costs outweigh the benefits of helping. In fact, people acting in altruistic ways maydisregard the personal costs associated with helping (Figure 12.26). For example, news accounts of the 9/11terrorist attacks on the World Trade Center in New York reported an employee in the first tower helped his co-workers make it to the exit stairwell. After helping a co-worker to safety he went back in the burning buildingto help additional co-workers. In this case the costs of helping were great, and the hero lost his life in thedestruction (Stewart, 2002)."

(credit: Don Halasy)Some researchers suggest that altruism operates on empathy. Empathy is the capacity to understand anotherperson\u2019s perspective, to feel what they feel. An empathetic person makes an emotional connection with othersand feels compelled to help (Batson, 1991). Other researchers argue that altruism is a form of selfless helpingthat is not motivated by benefits or feeling good about oneself. Certainly, after helping, people feel good aboutthemselves, but some researchers argue that this is a consequence of altruism, not a cause. Other researchersargue that helping is always self-serving because our egos are involved, and we receive benefits from helping(Cialdini, Brown, Lewis, Luce, & Neuberg 1997). It is challenging to determine experimentally the truemotivation for helping, whether it is largely self-serving (egoism) or selfless (altruism). Thus, a debate onwhether pure altruism exists continues.LINK TO LEARNINGSee this excerpt from the popular TV series Friendsin which egoism versus altruism is debated(http://openstax.org/l/friendsclip) to learn more.Forming RelationshipsWhat do you think is the single most influential factor in determining with whom you become friends andwhom you form romantic relationships? You might be surprised to learn that the answer is simple: the peoplewith whom you have the most contact. This most important factor is proximity. You are more likely to befriends with people you have regular contact with. For example, there are decades of research that shows thatyou are more likely to become friends with people who live in your dorm, your apartment building, or yourimmediate neighborhood than with people who live farther away (Festinger, Schachler, & Back, 1950). It issimply easier to form relationships with people you see often because you have the opportunity to get to knowthem.Similarity is another factor that influences who we form relationships with. We are more likely to becomefriends or lovers with someone who is similar to us in background, attitudes, and lifestyle. In fact, there is noevidence that opposites attract. Rather, we are attracted to people who are most like us (Figure 12.27)(McPherson, Smith-Lovin, & Cook, 2001). Why do you think we are attracted to people who are similar to us?Sharing things in common will certainly make it easy to get along with others and form connections. When youand another person share similar music taste, hobbies, food preferences, and so on, deciding what to do withyour time together might be easy. Homophily is the tendency for people to form social networks, includingfriendships, marriage, business relationships, and many other types of relationships, with others who are"

This can bequite obvious in a ceremony such as a wedding, and more subtle (but no less significant) in the day-to-day workingsof a relationship. (credit: modification of work by Shiraz Chanawala)But, homophily limits our exposure to diversity (McPherson et al., 2001). By forming relationships only withpeople who are similar to us, we will have homogenous groups and will not be exposed to different points ofview. In other words, because we are likely to spend time with those who are most like ourselves, we will havelimited exposure to those who are different than ourselves, including people of different races, ethnicities,social-economic status, and life situations.Once we form relationships with people, we desire reciprocity. Reciprocity is the give and take inrelationships. We contribute to relationships, but we expect to receive benefits as well. That is, we want ourrelationships to be a two way street. We are more likely to like and engage with people who like us back. Self-disclosure is part of the two way street. Self-disclosure is the sharing of personal information (Laurenceau,Barrett, & Pietromonaco, 1998). We form more intimate connections with people with whom we discloseimportant information about ourselves. Indeed, self-disclosure is a characteristic of healthy intimaterelationships, as long as the information disclosed is consistent with our own views (Cozby, 1973).AttractionWe have discussed how proximity and similarity lead to the formation of relationships, and that reciprocityand self-disclosure are important for relationship maintenance. But, what features of a person do we findattractive? We don\u2019t form relationships with everyone that lives or works near us, so how is it that we decidewhich specific individuals we will select as friends and lovers?Researchers have documented several characteristics that humans find attractive. First we look for friends andlovers who are physically attractive. People differ in what they consider attractive, and attractiveness isculturally influenced. Research, however, suggests that some universally attractive features in women includelarge eyes, high cheekbones, a narrow jaw line, a slender build (Buss, 1989), and a lower waist-to-hip ratio(Singh, 1993). For men, attractive traits include being tall, having broad shoulders, and a narrow waist (Buss,1989). Both men and women with high levels of facial and body symmetry are generally considered moreattractive than asymmetric individuals (Fink, Neave, Manning, & Grammer, 2006; Penton-Voak et al., 2001;Rikowski & Grammer, 1999). Social traits that people find attractive in potential female mates include warmth,affection, and social skills; in males, the attractive traits include achievement, leadership qualities, and jobskills (Regan & Berscheid, 1997). Although humans want mates who are physically attractive, this does notmean that we look for the most attractive person possible. In fact, this observation has led some to proposewhat is known as the matching hypothesis which asserts that people tend to pick someone they view as theirequal in physical attractiveness and social desirability (Taylor, Fiore, Mendelsohn, & Cheshire, 2011). Forexample, you and most people you know likely would say that a very attractive movie star is out of your league."

People weigh a potential partner\u2019s attractiveness against the likelihood of successwith that person. If you think you are particularly unattractive (even if you are not), you likely will seekpartners that are fairly unattractive (that is, unattractive in physical appearance or in behavior).Sternberg\u2019s Triangular Theory of LoveWe typically love the people with whom we form relationships, but the type of love we have for our family,friends, and lovers differs. Robert Sternberg (1986) proposed that there are three components of love:intimacy, passion, and commitment. These three components form a triangle that defines multiple types oflove: this is known as Sternberg\u2019s triangular theory of love (Figure 12.28). Intimacy is the sharing of detailsand intimate thoughts and emotions. Passion is the physical attraction\u2014the flame in the fire. Commitment isstanding by the person\u2014the \u201cin sickness and health\u201d part of the relationship.FIGURE 12.28 According to Sternberg\u2019s triangular theory of love, seven types of love can be described fromcombinations of three components: intimacy, passion, and commitment. (credit: modification of work by\u201cLnesa\u201d/Wikimedia Commons)Sternberg (1986) states that a healthy relationship will have all three components of love\u2014intimacy, passion,and commitment\u2014which is described as consummate love (Figure 12.29). However, different aspects of lovemight be more prevalent at different life stages. Other forms of love include liking, which is defined as havingintimacy but no passion or commitment. Infatuation is the presence of passion without intimacy orcommitment. Empty love is having commitment without intimacy or passion. Companionate love, which ischaracteristic of close friendships and family relationships, consists of intimacy and commitment but nopassion. Romantic love is defined by having passion and intimacy, but no commitment. Finally, fatuous love isdefined by having passion and commitment, but no intimacy, such as a long term sexual love affair. Can youdescribe other examples of relationships that fit these different types of love?"

(credit: Carloxito/Wikimedia)Social Exchange TheoryWe have discussed why we form relationships, what attracts us to others, and different types of love. But whatdetermines whether we are satisfied with and stay in a relationship? One theory that provides an explanationis social exchange theory. According to social exchange theory, we act as na\u00efve economists in keeping a tallyof the ratio of costs and benefits of forming and maintaining a relationship with others (Figure 12.30) (Rusbult& Van Lange, 2003).FIGURE 12.30 Acting like na\u00efve economists, people may keep track of the costs and benefits of maintaining arelationship. Typically, only those relationships in which the benefits outweigh the costs will be maintained.People are motivated to maximize the benefits of social exchanges, or relationships, and minimize the costs.People prefer to have more benefits than costs, or to have nearly equal costs and benefits, but most people aredissatisfied if their social exchanges create more costs than benefits. Let\u2019s discuss an example. If you have everdecided to commit to a romantic relationship, you probably considered the advantages and disadvantages ofyour decision. What are the benefits of being in a committed romantic relationship? You may have consideredhaving companionship, intimacy, and passion, but also being comfortable with a person you know well. Whatare the costs of being in a committed romantic relationship? You may think that over time boredom from beingwith only one person may set in; moreover, it may be expensive to share activities such as attending moviesand going to dinner. However, the benefits of dating your romantic partner presumably outweigh the costs, oryou wouldn\u2019t continue the relationship."

        "data": "Social psychology is the subfield of psychology that studies the power of the situation to influence individuals\u2019thoughts, feelings, and behaviors. Psychologists categorize the causes of human behavior as those due tointernal factors, such as personality, or those due to external factors, such as cultural and other socialinfluences. Behavior is better explained, however, by using both approaches. Lay people tend to over-rely ondispositional explanations for behavior and ignore the power of situational influences, a perspective called thefundamental attribution error. People from individualistic cultures are more likely to display this bias versuspeople from collectivistic cultures. Our explanations for our own and others behaviors can be biased due to nothaving enough information about others\u2019 motivations for behaviors and by providing explanations that bolsterour self-esteem."

In order to know how to act in agiven situation, we have shared cultural knowledge of how to behave depending on our role in society. Socialnorms dictate the behavior that is appropriate or inappropriate for each role. Each social role has scripts thathelp humans learn the sequence of appropriate behaviors in a given setting. The famous Stanford prisonexperiment is an example of how the power of the situation can dictate the social roles, norms, and scripts wefollow in a given situation, even if this behavior is contrary to our typical behavior."

An internal form of attitude change is cognitive dissonance or the tension we experience when ourthoughts, feelings, and behaviors are in conflict. In order to reduce dissonance, individuals can change theirbehavior, attitudes, or cognitions, or add a new cognition. External forces of persuasion include advertising;the features of advertising that influence our behaviors include the source, message, and audience. There aretwo primary routes to persuasion. The central route to persuasion uses facts and information to persuadepotential consumers. The peripheral route uses positive association with cues such as beauty, fame, andpositive emotions."

        "data": "The power of the situation can lead people to conform, or go along with the group, even in the face ofinaccurate information. Conformity to group norms is driven by two motivations, the desire to fit in and beliked and the desire to be accurate and gain information from the group. Authority figures also have influenceover our behaviors, and many people become obedient and follow orders even if the orders are contrary totheir personal values. Conformity to group pressures can also result in groupthink, or the faulty decision-making process that results from cohesive group members trying to maintain group harmony. Groupsituations can improve human behavior through facilitating performance on easy tasks, but inhibitingperformance on difficult tasks. The presence of others can also lead to social loafing when individual effortscannot be evaluated."

Prejudice, or negative feelings and evaluations, is common when people are from a different socialgroup (i.e., out-group). Negative attitudes toward out-groups can lead to discrimination. Prejudice anddiscrimination against others can be based on gender, race, ethnicity, social class, sexual orientation, or avariety of other social identities. In-group\u2019s who feel threatened may blame the out-groups for their plight, thususing the out-group as a scapegoat for their frustration."

Forming relationships with others is a necessity for social beings. We typically form relationships withpeople who are close to us in proximity and people with whom we share similarities. We expect reciprocity andself-disclosure in our relationships. We also want to form relationships with people who are physicallyattractive, though standards for attractiveness vary by culture and gender. There are many types of love thatare determined by various combinations of intimacy, passion, and commitment; consummate love, which isthe ideal form of love, contains all three components. When determining satisfaction and whether to maintaina relationship, individuals often use a social exchange approach and weigh the costs and benefits of formingand maintaining a relationship.Review Questions1.

Then-Deputy Commissioner Grace Kim wrote a letter to Social Securityemployees explaining the reasons the program was ending and cited an increased workload and a backlog ofcases as reasons for ending the pilot program. This change in the telework policy came on the heels of anegotiation between the American Federal Government Employee Union and the Social SecurityAdministration, a negotiation that had to be brokered by the Federal Services Impasse Panel (a third-partyfederal organization developed specifically to arbitrate in situations where negotiations between unionofficials and federal organizations break down and progress halts between the organization and the unionrepresentatives) (Wagner, 2019a).The May 2019 decision by the panel gave Social Security Agency managers the ability to limit or restricttelework for employees using their discretion to ensure that all tasks were being completed and wait timeswere normal. One of the biggest reasons cited for this was that the organization was able to provide evidencethat after the implementation of a telework program, the average wait time for individuals temporarilyincreased, causing a backlog of work to be completed at a later date. Although the Social SecurityAdministration pushed the official end date for all telework in the agency to March of 2020, the program wasofficially ended. In the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic, Congress requested a review of the telework policyand raised questions about whether it should be revived to serve as a preventative measure for reducing andslowing the spread of the virus (Wagner, 2019b). Could this allow employees to continue working while notcoming to the workplace in order to help prevent the spread of illness? What were the benefits versus the costsof implementing a telework policy again for employees as the spread of the virus continued? What didprevious research show related to the positive and negative benefits to the organization and the employeeswith respect to telework?"

Sleeping was the only other activity they spentmore time on with an average of about 43\u201362 hours per week. The workday is a significant portion of workers\u2019time and energy. It impacts their lives and their family\u2019s lives in positive and negative physical andpsychological ways. Industrial and organizational (I-O) psychology is a branch of psychology that studieshow human behavior and psychology affect work and how they are affected by work.Industrial and organizational psychologists work in four main contexts: academia, government, consultingfirms, and business. Most I-O psychologists have a master\u2019s or doctorate degree. The field of I-O psychology canbe divided into three broad areas (Figure 13.2 and Figure 13.3): industrial, organizational, and human factors.Industrial psychology is concerned with describing job requirements and assessing individuals for theirability to meet those requirements. In addition, once employees are hired, industrial psychology studies anddevelops ways to train, evaluate, and respond to those evaluations. As a consequence of its concern forcandidate characteristics, industrial psychology must also consider issues of legality regarding discriminationin hiring. Organizational psychology is a discipline interested in how the relationships among employeesaffect those employees and the performance of a business. This includes studying worker satisfaction,motivation, and commitment. This field also studies management, leadership, and organizational culture, aswell as how an organization\u2019s structures, management and leadership styles, social norms, and roleexpectations affect individual behavior. As a result of its interest in worker wellbeing and relationships,organizational psychology also considers the subjects of harassment, including sexual harassment, andworkplace violence. Human factors psychology is the study of how workers interact with the tools of work andhow to design those tools to optimize workers\u2019 productivity, safety, and health. These studies can involveinteractions as straightforward as the fit of a desk, chair, and computer to a human having to sit on the chair atthe desk using the computer for several hours each day. They can also include the examination of how humansinteract with complex displays and their ability to interpret them accurately and quickly. In Europe, this field isreferred to as ergonomics.FIGURE 13.2 (a) Industrial psychology focuses on hiring and maintaining employees.

(credit \"ball chair\": modificationof work by Chris Rosario; credit \"standing desk\": modification of work by \"juhansonin_Flickr\"/Flickr; credit \"cycledesk\": modification of work by \"Benny Wong_Flickr\"/Flickr)Occupational health psychology (OHP) deals with the stress, diseases, and disorders that can affect employeesas a result of the workplace. As such, the field is informed by research from the medical, biological,psychological, organizational, human factors, human resources, and industrial fields. Individuals in this fieldseek to examine the ways in which the organization affects the quality of work life for an employee and theresponses that employees have towards their organization or as a result of their organization\u2019s influence onthem. The responses for employees are not limited to the workplace as there may be some spillover into theirpersonal lives outside of work, especially if there is not good work-life balance. The ultimate goal of anoccupational health psychologist is to improve the overall health and well-being of an individual, and, as aresult, increase the overall health of the organization (Society for Occupational Health Psychology, 2020).In 2009, the field of humanitarian work psychology (HWP) was developed as the brainchild of a small group ofI-O psychologists who met at a conference. Realizing they had a shared set of goals involving helping those whoare underserved and underprivileged, the I-O psychologists formally formed the group in 2012 and haveapproximately 300 members worldwide. Although this is a small number, the group continues to expand. The"

This sitealso offers several I-O psychologist profiles.The Historical Development of Industrial and Organizational PsychologyIndustrial and organizational psychology had its origins in the early 20th century. Several influential earlypsychologists studied issues that today would be categorized as industrial psychology: James Cattell(1860\u20131944), Hugo M\u00fcnsterberg (1863\u20131916), Walter Dill Scott (1869\u20131955), Robert Yerkes (1876\u20131956),Walter Bingham (1880\u20131952), and Lillian Gilbreth (1878\u20131972). Cattell, M\u00fcnsterberg, and Scott had beenstudents of Wilhelm Wundt, the father of experimental psychology. Some of these researchers had beeninvolved in work in the area of industrial psychology before World War I. Cattell\u2019s contribution to industrialpsychology is largely reflected in his founding of a psychological consulting company, which is still operatingtoday called the Psychological Corporation, and in the accomplishments of students at Columbia in the area ofindustrial psychology. In 1913, M\u00fcnsterberg published Psychology and Industrial Efficiency, which coveredtopics such as employee selection, employee training, and effective advertising.Scott was one of the first psychologists to apply psychology to advertising, management, and personnelselection. In 1903, Scott published two books: The Theory of Advertisingand Psychology of Advertising. Theyare the first books to describe the use of psychology in the business world. By 1911 he published two morebooks, Influencing Men in Businessand Increasing Human Efficiency in Business. In 1916 a newly formeddivision in the Carnegie Institute of Technology hired Scott to conduct applied research on employee selection(Katzell & Austin, 1992).The focus of all this research was in what we now know as industrial psychology; it was only later in thecentury that the field of organizational psychology developed as an experimental science (Katzell & Austin,1992). In addition to their academic positions, these researchers also worked directly for businesses asconsultants.When the United States entered World War I in April 1917, the work of psychologists working in this disciplineexpanded to include their contributions to military efforts. At that time Yerkes was the president of the25-year-old American Psychological Association (APA). The APA is a professional association in the UnitedStates for clinical and research psychologists. Today the APA performs a number of functions includingholding conferences, accrediting university degree programs, and publishing scientific journals. Yerkesorganized a group under the Surgeon General\u2019s Office (SGO) that developed methods for screening andselecting enlisted men. They developed the Army Alpha test to measure mental abilities. The Army Beta testwas a non-verbal form of the test that was administered to illiterate and non-English-speaking draftees. Scottand Bingham organized a group under the Adjutant General\u2019s Office (AGO) with the goal to develop selectionmethods for officers. They created a catalogue of occupational needs for the Army, essentially a job-descriptionsystem and a system of performance ratings and occupational skill tests for officers (Katzell & Austin, 1992).After the war, work on personnel selection continued. For example, Millicent Pond researched the selection offactory workers, comparing the results of pre-employment tests with various indicators of job performance(Vinchur & Koppes, 2014).From 1929 to 1932 Elton Mayo (1880\u20131949) and his colleagues began a series of studies at a plant nearChicago, Western Electric\u2019s Hawthorne Works (Figure 13.4). This long-term project took industrial psychologybeyond just employee selection and placement to a study of more complex problems of interpersonalrelations, motivation, and organizational dynamics. These studies mark the origin of organizationalpsychology. They began as research into the effects of the physical work environment (e.g., level of lighting in afactory), but the researchers found that the psychological and social factors in the factory were of more"

What the original researchers found was that any change in a variable, such as lighting levels, ledto an improvement in productivity; this was true even when the change was negative, such as a return to poorlighting. The effect faded when the attention faded (Roethlisberg & Dickson, 1939). The Hawthorne-effectconcept endures today as an important experimental consideration in many fields and a factor that has to becontrolled for in an experiment. In other words, an experimental treatment of some kind may produce aneffect simply because it involves greater attention of the researchers on the participants (McCarney et al.,2007).FIGURE 13.5 Researchers discovered that employees performed better when researchers or supervisors observedand interacted with them, a dynamic termed the Hawthorne effect.LINK TO LEARNINGWatch this video of first-hand accounts of the original Hawthorne studies (http://openstax.org/l/ATT) to learnmore."

Kurt Lewin also conductedresearch on the effects of various leadership styles, team structure, and team dynamics (Katzell & Austin,1992). Lewin is considered the founder of social psychology and much of his work and that of his studentsproduced results that had important influences in organizational psychology. Lewin and his students\u2019 researchincluded an important early study that used children to study the effect of leadership style on aggression,group dynamics, and satisfaction (Lewin, Lippitt, & White, 1939). Lewin was also responsible for coining theterm group dynamics, and he was involved in studies of group interactions, cooperation, competition, andcommunication that bear on organizational psychology.Parallel to these studies in industrial and organizational psychology, the field of human factors psychology wasalso developing. Frederick Taylor was an engineer who saw that if one could redesign the workplace therewould be an increase in both output for the company and wages for the workers. In 1911 he put forward histheory in a book titled, The Principles of Scientific Management(Figure 13.6). His book examines managementtheories, personnel selection and training, as well as the work itself, using time and motion studies. Taylorargued that the principle goal of management should be to make the most money for the employer, along withthe best outcome for the employee. He believed that the best outcome for the employee and managementwould be achieved through training and development so that each employee could provide the best work. Hebelieved that by conducting time and motion studies for both the organization and the employee, the bestinterests of both were addressed. Time-motion studies were methods aimed to improve work by dividingdifferent types of operations into sections that could be measured. These analyses were used to standardizework and to check the efficiency of people and equipment.Personnel selection is a process used by recruiting personnel within the company to recruit and select the bestcandidates for the job. Training may need to be conducted depending on what skills the hired candidate has.Often companies will hire someone with the personality that fits in with others but who may be lacking inskills. Skills can be taught, but personality cannot be easily changed.FIGURE 13.6 (a) Frederick Taylor (1911) strived to engineer workplaces to increase productivity, based on the ideashe set forth in (b) his book, The Principles of Scientific Management. (c) Taylor designed this steam hammer at theMidvale Steel Company.

Taylor showedthat the workers could be more productive by taking work rests. This method of rest increased workerproductivity from 12.5 to 47.0 tons moved per day with less reported fatigue as well as increased wages for theworkers who were paid by the ton. At the same time, the company\u2019s cost was reduced from 9.2 cents to 3.9cents per ton. Despite these increases in productivity, Taylor\u2019s theory received a great deal of criticism at thetime because it was believed that it would exploit workers and reduce the number of workers needed. Alsocontroversial was the underlying concept that only a manager could determine the most efficient method of"

Taylor\u2019s theory was underpinned by the notionthat a worker was fundamentally lazy and the goal of Taylor\u2019s scientific management approach was tomaximize productivity without much concern for worker well-being. His approach was criticized by unionsand those sympathetic to workers (Van De Water, 1997).Gilbreth was another influential I-O psychologist who strove to find ways to increase productivity (Figure 13.7).Using time and motion studies, Gilbreth and her husband, Frank, worked to make workers more efficient byreducing the number of motions required to perform a task. She not only applied these methods to industrybut also to the home, office, shops, and other areas. She investigated employee fatigue and time managementstress and found many employees were motivated by money and job satisfaction. In 1914, Gilbreth wrote thebook title, The Psychology of Management: The Function of the Mind in Determining, Teaching, and InstallingMethods of Least Waste, and she is known as the mother of modern management. Some of Gilbreth\u2019scontributions are still in use today: you can thank her for the idea to put shelves inside on refrigerator doors,and she also came up with the concept of using a foot pedal to operate the lid of trash can (Gilbreth, 1914,1998; Koppes, 1997; Lancaster, 2004). Gilbreth was the first woman to join the American Society of MechanicalEngineers in 1926, and in 1966 she was awarded the Hoover Medal of the American Society of Civil Engineers.Taylor and Gilbreth\u2019s work improved productivity, but these innovations also improved the fit betweentechnology and the human using it. The study of machine\u2013human fit is known as ergonomics or human factorspsychology.FIGURE 13.7 (a) Lillian Gilbreth studied efficiency improvements that were applicable in the workplace, home, andother areas.

Bingham was hired as the chief psychologistfor the War Department (now the Department of Defense) and developed new systems for job selection,classification, training, ad performance review, plus methods for team development, morale change, andattitude change (Katzell & Austin, 1992). Other countries, such as Canada and the United Kingdom, likewisesaw growth in I-O psychology during World War II (McMillan, Stevens, & Kelloway, 2009). In the years after thewar, both industrial psychology and organizational psychology became areas of significant research effort.Concerns about the fairness of employment tests arose, and the ethnic and gender biases in various tests wereevaluated with mixed results. In addition, a great deal of research went into studying job satisfaction andemployee motivation (Katzell & Austin, 1992).The research and work of I-O psychologists in the areas of employee selection, placement, and performanceappraisal became increasingly important in the 1960s.

This law protects employees againstdiscrimination based on race, color, religion, sex, or national origin, as well as discrimination against anemployee for associating with an individual in one of these categories.Organizations had to adjust to the social, political, and legal climate of the Civil Rights movement, and theseissues needed to be addressed by members of I/O in research and practice.There are many reasons for organizations to be interested in I/O so that they can better understand thepsychology of their workers, which in turn helps them understand how their organizations can become moreproductive and competitive. For example, most large organizations are now competing on a global level, andthey need to understand how to motivate workers in order to achieve high productivity and efficiency. Mostcompanies also have a diverse workforce and need to understand the psychological complexity of the people inthese diverse backgrounds.Today, I-O psychology is a diverse and deep field of research and practice, as you will learn about in the rest ofthis chapter. The Society for Industrial and Organizational Psychology (SIOP), a division of the APA, lists 8,000members (SIOP, 2014) and the Bureau of Labor Statistics\u2014U.S. Department of Labor (2013) has projected thisprofession will have the greatest growth of all job classifications in the 20 years following 2012.

This involves job analysis, which means accurately describing the task or job.Then, organizations must identify the characteristics of applicants for a match to the job analysis. It alsoinvolves training employees from their first day on the job throughout their tenure within the organization,and appraising their performance along the way.Selecting EmployeesWhen you read job advertisements, do you ever wonder how the company comes up with the job description?Often, this is done with the help of I-O psychologists. There are two related but different approaches to jobanalysis\u2014you may be familiar with the results of each as they often appear on the same job advertisement. Thefirst approach is task-oriented and lists in detail the tasks that will be performed for the job. Each task istypically rated on scales for how frequently it is performed, how difficult it is, and how important it is to the job.The second approach is worker-oriented. This approach describes the characteristics required of the workerto successfully perform the job. This second approach has been called job specification (Dierdorff & Wilson,2003). For job specification, the knowledge, skills, and abilities (KSAs) that the job requires are identified.Observation, surveys, and interviews are used to obtain the information required for both types of job analysis.It is possible to observe someone who is proficient in a position and analyze what skills are apparent. Anotherapproach used is to interview people presently holding that position, their peers, and their supervisors to get aconsensus of what they believe are the requirements of the job.How accurate and reliable is a job analysis? Research suggests that it can depend on the nature of thedescriptions and the source for the job analysis. For example, Dierdorff & Wilson (2003) found that jobanalyses developed from descriptions provided by people holding the job themselves were the least reliable;however, they did not study or speculate why this was the case."

These evaluations can involve testing, aninterview, and work samples or exercises. You learned about personality tests in the chapter on personality; inthe I-O context, they are used to identify the personality characteristics of the candidate in an effort to matchthose to personality characteristics that would ensure good performance on the job. For example, a high ratingof agreeableness might be desirable in a customer support position. However, it is not always clear how best tocorrelate personality characteristics with predictions of job performance. It might be that too high of a score onagreeableness is actually a hindrance in the customer support position. For example, if a customer has amisperception about a product or service, agreeing with their misperception will not ultimately lead toresolution of their complaint. Any use of personality tests should be accompanied by a verified assessment ofwhat scores on the test correlate with good performance (Arthur, Woehr, & Graziano, 2001). Other types of teststhat may be given to candidates include IQ tests, integrity tests, and physical tests, such as drug tests orphysical fitness tests.To better understand the hiring process, let\u2019s consider an example case. A company determined it had an openposition and advertised it. The human resources (HR) manager directed the hiring team to start therecruitment process. Imani saw the advertisement and submitted her r\u00e9sum\u00e9, which went into the collectionof candidate r\u00e9sum\u00e9s. The HR team reviewed the candidates\u2019 credentials and provided a list of the bestpotential candidates to the department manager, who reached out to them (including Imani) to set upindividual interviews.WHAT DO YOU THINK?Using Cutoff Scores to Determine Job SelectionMany positions require applicants to take tests as part of the selection process. These can include IQ tests, job-specific skills tests, or personality tests. The organization may set cutoff scores (i.e., a score below which acandidate will not move forward) for each test to determine whether the applicant moves on to the next stage.For example, there was a case of Robert Jordan, a 49-year-old college graduate who applied for a position withthe police force in New London, Connecticut. As part of the selection process, Jordan took the WonderlicPersonnel Test (WPT), a test designed to measure cognitive ability.Jordan did not make it to the interview stage because his WPT score of 33, equivalent to an IQ score of 125 (100is the average IQ score), was too high. The New London Police department policy is to not interview anyone whohas a WPT score over 27 (equivalent to an IQ score over 104) because they believe anyone who scores higherwould be bored with police work. The average score for police officers nationwide is the equivalent of an IQ scoreof 104 (Jordan v. New London, 2000; ABC News, 2000).Jordan sued the police department alleging that his rejection was discrimination and his civil rights were violatedbecause he was denied equal protection under the law. The 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals upheld a lowercourt\u2019s decision that the city of New London did not discriminate against him because the same standards wereapplied to everyone who took the exam (The New York Times, 1999).What do you think? When might universal cutoff points make sense in a hiring decision, and when might theyeliminate otherwise potentially strong employees?InterviewsMost jobs for mid-size to large-size businesses in the United States require a personal interview as a step in theselection process. Because interviews are commonly used, they have been the subject of considerable researchby industrial psychologists. Information derived from job analysis usually forms the basis for the types of"

Interviews can provide a more dynamic source of information about the candidate thanstandard testing measures. Importantly, social factors and body language can influence the outcome of theinterview. These include influences, such as the degree of similarity of the applicant to the interviewer andnonverbal behaviors, such as hand gestures, head nodding, and smiling (Bye, Horverak, Sandal, Sam, & Vivjer,2014; Raki\u0107, Steffens, & Mummendey, 2011).There are two types of interviews: unstructured and structured. In an unstructured interview, the interviewermay ask different questions of each different candidate. One candidate might be asked about her career goals,and another might be asked about his previous work experience. In an unstructured interview, the questionsare often, though not always, unspecified beforehand. And in an unstructured interview the responses toquestions asked are generally not scored using a standard system. In a structured interview, the interviewerasks the same questions of every candidate, the questions are prepared in advance, and the interviewer uses astandardized rating system for each response. With this approach, the interviewer can accurately compare twocandidates\u2019 interviews. In a meta-analysis of studies examining the effectiveness of various types of jobinterviews, McDaniel, Whetzel, Schmidt & Maurer (1994) found that structured interviews were more effectiveat predicting subsequent job performance of the job candidate.Let\u2019s return to our example case. For her first interview, Imani was interviewed by a team of employees at thecompany. She was one of five candidates interviewed that day for the position. Each interviewee was asked thesame list of questions, by the same people, so the interview experience was as consistent as possible acrossapplicants. At the end of the interviews, the HR team met and reviewed the answers given by Imani and theother candidates. The HR team then identified a few new qualified candidates and conducted a new round ofinitial interviews, while the first group of potential hires waited to hear back from the company.EVERYDAY CONNECTIONPreparing for the Job InterviewYou might be wondering if psychology research can tell you how to succeed in a job interview. As you canimagine, most research is concerned with the employer\u2019s interest in choosing the most appropriate candidate forthe job, a goal that makes sense for the candidate too. But suppose you are not the only qualified candidate forthe job; is there a way to increase your chances of being hired? A limited amount of research has addressed thisquestion.As you might expect, nonverbal cues are important in an interview. Liden, Martin, & Parsons (1993) found thatlack of eye contact and smiling on the part of the applicant led to lower applicant ratings. Studies of impressionmanagement on the part of an applicant have shown that self-promotion behaviors generally have a positiveimpact on interviewers (Gilmore & Ferris, 1989). Different personality types use different forms of impressionmanagement, for example extroverts use verbal self-promotion, and applicants high in agreeableness use non-verbal methods such as smiling and eye contact. Self-promotion was most consistently related with a positiveoutcome for the interview, particularly if it was related to the candidate\u2019s person\u2013job fit. However, it is possible tooverdo self-promotion with experienced interviewers (Howard & Ferris, 1996). Barrick, Swider & Stewart (2010)examined the effect of first impressions during the rapport building that typically occurs before an interviewbegins. They found that initial judgments by interviewers during this period were related to job offers and that thejudgments were about the candidate\u2019s competence and not just likability. Levine and Feldman (2002) looked atthe influence of several nonverbal behaviors in mock interviews on candidates\u2019 likability and projections ofcompetence. Likability was affected positively by greater smiling behavior. Interestingly, other behaviors affectedlikability differently depending on the gender of the applicant. Men who displayed higher eye contact were lesslikable; women were more likable when they made greater eye contact. However, for this study male applicantswere interviewed by men and female applicants were interviewed by women. In a study carried out in a realsetting, DeGroot & Gooty (2009) found that nonverbal cues affected interviewers\u2019 assessments about"

They looked at visual cues, which can often be modified by the candidate and vocal (nonverbal) cues,which are more difficult to modify. They found that interviewer judgment was positively affected by visual andvocal cues of conscientiousness, visual and vocal cues of openness to experience, and vocal cues ofextroversion.What is the take home message from the limited research that has been done? Learn to be aware of yourbehavior during an interview. You can do this by practicing and soliciting feedback from mock interviews. Payattention to any nonverbal cues you are projecting and work at presenting nonverbal cures that projectconfidence and positive personality traits. And finally, pay attention to the first impression you are making as itmay also have an impact in the interview.TrainingTraining is an important element of success and performance in many jobs. Most jobs begin with anorientation period during which the new employee is provided information regarding the company history,policies, and administrative protocols such as time tracking, benefits, and reporting requirements. Animportant goal of orientation training is to educate the new employee about the organizational culture, thevalues, visions, hierarchies, norms and ways the company\u2019s employees interact\u2014essentially how theorganization is run, how it operates, and how it makes decisions. There will also be training that is specific tothe job the individual was hired to do, or training during the individual\u2019s period of employment that teachesaspects of new duties, or how to use new physical or software tools. Much of these kinds of training will beformalized for the employee; for example, orientation training is often accomplished using softwarepresentations, group presentations by members of the human resources department or with people in the newhire\u2019s department (Figure 13.9).FIGURE 13.9 Training usually begins with an orientation period during which a new employee learns aboutcompany policies, practices, and culture. (credit: Cory Zanker)Mentoring is a form of informal training in which an experienced employee guides the work of a newemployee. In some situations, mentors will be formally assigned to a new employee, while in others amentoring relationship may develop informally.Mentoring effects on the mentor and the employee being mentored, the prot\u00e9g\u00e9, have been studied in recentyears.

Gentry,Weber, & Sadri (2008) found that mentoring was positively related with performance ratings by supervisors.Allen, Lentz, & Day (2006) found in a comparison of mentors and non-mentors that mentoring led to greaterreported salaries and promotions.Mentoring is recognized to be particularly important to the career success of women (McKeen & Bujaki, 2007)by creating connections to informal networks, reducing feelings of isolation, and with overcomingdiscrimination in job promotions.Researchers have worked to understand the impacts of gender, race, and ethnicity on mentoring relationships,especially whether outcomes differ based on the gender or racial/ethnic makeup of the mentor-mentee pair.Overall, women and members of underrepresented racial/ethnic populations do not lack access to mentors,but they do lack access to mentors of the same gender, race, and ethnicity, because the senior roles in manyorganizations are made up of White men (MLDC, 2010). Results from these studies are mixed, but generallysuggest that pairings made up of two people of the same gender or race/ethnicity have better psychosocialoutcomes, such as a feeling of more support (Koberg, Boss, & Goodman, 1998; Allen et al, 2006). On the otherhand, women and people of color typically experience greater career advancement or higher pay whenmentored by people of a different gender or race/ethnicity (Parks-Yancy, 2012).A 2003 study by Arthur, Bennett, Edens, and Bell examined multiple other studies to determine how effectiveorganizational training is. Their results showed that training was effective, based on four types ofmeasurement: (1) the immediate response of the employee to the training effort, (2) testing at the end oftraining to demonstrate that learning outcomes were met, (3) behavioral measurements of job activities bysupervisors, and (4) results such as productivity and profits. The examined studies represented diverse formsof training including self-instruction, lecture and discussion, and computer assisted training.Evaluating EmployeesIndustrial and organizational psychologists are typically involved in designing performance-appraisal systemsfor organizations. These systems are designed to evaluate whether each employee is performing satisfactorily.Industrial and organizational psychologists study, research, and implement ways to make work evaluations asfair and positive as possible; they also work to decrease the subjectivity involved with performance ratings.Fairly evaluated work helps employees do their jobs better, improves the likelihood of people being in the rightjobs for their talents, maintains fairness, and identifies company and individual training needs. In ourexample case, Imani was offered the position and was hired with a 90-day probation period. During that time,she met with her supervisor to discuss her performance and the expectations of the position and her growth.At the end of the 90 days, it was determined that Imani was meeting the expectations of her employer and hadpassed her probationary period. Imani was excited to now have a permanent job.Performance appraisals are typically documented several times a year, often with a formal process and anannual face-to-face brief meeting between an employee and their supervisor. It is important that the originaljob analysis play a role in performance appraisal as well as any goals that have been set by the employee or bythe employee and supervisor. The meeting is often used for the supervisor to communicate specific concernsabout the employee\u2019s performance and to positively reinforce elements of good performance. It may also beused to discuss specific performance rewards, such as a pay increase, or consequences of poor performance,such as a probationary period. Part of the function of performance appraisals for the organization is todocument poor performance to bolster decisions to terminate an employee.Performance appraisals are becoming more complex processes within organizations and are often used tomotivate employees to improve performance and expand their areas of competence, in addition to assessingtheir job performance. In this capacity, performance appraisals can be used to identify opportunities fortraining or whether a particular training program has been successful. One approach to performanceappraisal is called 360-degree feedback appraisal (Figure 13.10). In this system, the employee\u2019s appraisal"

Occasionally, outside observers may be used as well, such as customers. The purpose of360-degree system is to give the employee (who may be a manager) and supervisor different perspectives ofthe employee\u2019s job performance; the system should help employees make improvements through their ownefforts or through training. The system is also used in a traditional performance-appraisal context, providingthe supervisor with more information with which to make decisions about the employee\u2019s position andcompensation (Tornow, 1993a).FIGURE 13.10 In a 360-degree performance appraisal, supervisors, customers, direct reports, peers, and theemployee himself rate an employee\u2019s performance.Few studies have assessed the effectiveness of 360-degree methods, but Atkins and Wood (2002) found thatthe self and peer ratings were unreliable as an assessment of an employee\u2019s performance and that evensupervisors tended to underrate employees that gave themselves modest feedback ratings. However, adifferent perspective sees this variability in ratings as a positive in that it provides for greater learning on thepart of the employees as they and their supervisor discuss the reasons for the discrepancies (Tornow, 1993b).In theory, performance appraisals should be an asset for an organization wishing to achieve its goals, and mostemployees will actually solicit feedback regarding their jobs if it is not offered (DeNisi & Kluger, 2000).However, in practice, many performance evaluations are disliked by organizations, employees, or both(Fletcher, 2001), and few of them have been adequately tested to see if they do in fact improve performance ormotivate employees (DeNisi & Kluger, 2000). One of the reasons evaluations fail to accomplish their purpose inan organization is that performance appraisal systems are often used incorrectly or are of an inappropriatetype for an organization\u2019s particular culture (Schraeder, Becton, & Portis, 2007). An organization\u2019s culture ishow the organization is run, how it operates, and how it makes decisions. It is based on the collective values,hierarchies, and how individuals within the organization interact. Examining the effectiveness of performanceappraisal systems in particular organizations and the effectiveness of training for the implementation of theperformance appraisal system is an active area of research in industrial psychology (Fletcher, 2001).Bias and Protections in HiringIn an ideal hiring process, an organization would generate a job analysis that accurately reflects the"

For many reasons, hiring decisions in the real world are oftenmade based on factors other than matching a job analysis to KSAs. As mentioned earlier, interview rankingscan be influenced by other factors: similarity to the interviewer (Bye, Horverak, Sandal, Sam, & Vijver, 2014)and the regional accent of the interviewee (Raki\u0107, Steffens, & Mummendey 2011). A study by Agerstr\u00f6m &Rooth (2011) examined hiring managers\u2019 decisions to invite equally qualified non-obese and obese jobapplicants to an interview. The decisions of the hiring managers were based on photographs of the twoapplicants. The study found that hiring managers that scored high on a test of negative associations withoverweight people displayed a bias in favor of inviting the equally qualified non-obese applicant but notinviting the obese applicant. The association test measures automatic or subconscious associations betweenan individual\u2019s negative or positive values and, in this case, the body-size attribute. A meta-analysis ofexperimental studies found that physical attractiveness benefited individuals in various job-related outcomessuch as hiring, promotion, and performance review (Hosoda, Stone-Romero, & Coats, 2003). They also foundthat the strength of the benefit appeared to be decreasing with time between the late 1970s and the late 1990s.Some hiring criteria may be related to a particular group an applicant belongs to and not individual abilities.Unless membership in that group directly affects potential job performance, a decision based on groupmembership is discriminatory (Figure 13.11). To combat hiring discrimination, in the United States there arenumerous city, state, and federal laws that prevent hiring based on various group-membership criteria. Forexample, did you know it is illegal for a potential employer to ask your age in an interview? Did you know thatan employer cannot ask you whether you are married, a U.S. citizen, have disabilities, or what your race orreligion is? They cannot even ask questions that might shed some light on these attributes, such as where youwere born or who you live with. These are only a few of the restrictions that are in place to preventdiscrimination in hiring. In the United States, federal anti-discrimination laws are administered by the U.S.Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC).FIGURE 13.11 (a) Pregnancy, (b) religion, and (c) age are some of the criteria on which hiring decisions cannotlegally be made.

The Equal PayAct requires that equal pay for men and women in the same workplace who are performing equal work.Despite the law, persistent inequities in earnings between men and women exist. Corbett & Hill (2012) studiedone facet of the gender gap by looking at earnings in the first year after college in the United States. Justcomparing the earnings of women to men, women earn about 82 cents for every dollar a man earns in theirfirst year out of college. However, some of this difference can be explained by education, career, and lifechoices, such as choosing majors with lower earning potential or specific jobs within a field that have lessresponsibility. When these factors were corrected the study found an unexplained seven-cents-on-the-dollargap in the first year after college that can be attributed to gender discrimination in pay. This approach toanalysis of the gender pay gap, called the human capital model, has been criticized. Lips (2013) argues that theeducation, career, and life choices can, in fact, be constrained by necessities imposed by genderdiscrimination. This suggests that removing these factors entirely from the gender gap equation leads to anestimate of the size of the pay gap that is too small."

The Pregnancy Discrimination Act of 1978 amends the Civil RightsAct; it prohibits job (e.g., employment, pay, and termination) discrimination of a woman because she ispregnant as long as she can perform the work required.The Supreme Court ruling in Griggs v. Duke Power Co.made it illegal under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act toinclude educational requirements in a job description (e.g., high school diploma) that negatively impacts onerace over another if the requirement cannot be shown to be directly related to job performance. The EEOC(2014) received more than 94,000 charges of various kinds of employment discrimination in 2013. Many of thefilings are for multiple forms of discrimination and include charges of retaliation for making a claim, whichitself is illegal. Only a small fraction of these claims become suits filed in a federal court, although the suitsmay represent the claims of more than one person. In 2013, there were 148 suits filed in federal courts.LINK TO LEARNINGIn 2011, the U.S. Supreme Court decided a case in which women plaintiffs were attempting to group togetherin a class-action suit against Walmart for gender discrimination in promotion and pay. The case was importantbecause it was the only practical way for individual women who felt they had been discriminated against tosustain a court battle for redress of their claims. The Court ultimately decided against the plaintiffs, and theright to a class-action suit was denied. However, the case itself effectively publicized the issue of genderdiscrimination in employment. Watch this video about the case history and issues (http://openstax.org/l/SCOTUS1) and this PBS NewsHour video about the arguments (http://openstax.org/l/SCOTUS2) to learn more.Based on a 2020 Supreme Court ruling regarding the application of the Civil Rights Act, federal legislation nowprotects employees in the private sector from discrimination related to sexual orientation and gender identity.These groups include lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender individuals. There is evidence of discriminationderived from surveys of workers, studies of complaint filings, wage comparison studies, and controlled job-interview studies (Badgett, Sears, Lau, & Ho, 2009). Prior to the ruling, federal legislation protected federalemployees from such discrimination; the District of Columbia and 20 states have laws protecting public andprivate employees from discrimination for sexual orientation (American Civil Liberties Union, n.d). Most of thestates with these laws also protect against discrimination based on gender identity. Gender identity refers toone\u2019s sense of being male, female, neither of these, both of these, or another gender.While the Supreme Court's Civil Rights Act interpretation is regarded as a landmark outcome for LGBTQpeople, it will be continually tested by organizations that for various reasons see a need to exclude LGBTQpeople from employment or service. The First Amendment protects religious organizations from some aspectsof anti-discrimination laws, and some recent court decisions have expanded these exceptions so that certainministries, schools, or other organizations could avoid employing or serving LGBTQ people.Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA)The Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) of 1990 states people may not be discriminated against due to thenature of their disability. A disability is defined as a physical or mental impairment that limits one or moremajor life activities such as hearing, walking, and breathing. An employer must make reasonableaccommodations for the performance of the job of an employee with disabilities. This might include makingthe work facility accessible with ramps, providing readers for blind personnel, or allowing for more frequentbreaks. The ADA has now been expanded to include individuals with alcoholism, former drug use, obesity, orpsychiatric disabilities. The premise of the law is that individuals with disabilities can contribute to anorganization and they cannot be discriminated against because of their disabilities (O'Keefe & Bruyere, 1994).The Civil Rights Act and the Age Discrimination in Employment Act make provisions for bona fide"

For example, there may be cases in which religion,national origin, age, and sex are bona fide occupational qualifications. There are no BFOQ exceptions thatapply to race, although the first amendment protects artistic expressions, such as films, in making race arequirement of a role. Clearcut examples of BFOQs would be hiring someone of a specific religion for aleadership position in a worship facility, or for an executive position in religiously affiliated institutions, suchas the president of a university with religious ties. Age has been determined to be a BFOQ for airline pilots;hence, there are mandatory retirement ages for safety reasons. Sex has been determined as a BFOQ for guardsin male prisons.Sex or gender is the most common reason for invoking a BFOQ as a defense against accusing an employer ofdiscrimination (Manley, 2009). Courts have established a three-part test for sex-related BFOQs that are oftenused in other types of legal cases for determining whether a BFOQ exists. The first of these is whether all orsubstantially all women would be unable to perform a job. This is the reason most physical limitations, such as\u201cable to lift 30 pounds,\u201d fail as reasons to discriminate because most women are able to lift this weight. Thesecond test is the \u201cessence of the business\u201d test, in which having to choose the other gender would underminethe essence of the business operation. This test was the reason the now defunct Pan American World Airways(i.e., Pan Am) was told it could not hire only women flight attendants. Hiring men would not have underminedthe essense of this business. On a deeper level, this means that hiring cannot be made purely on customers\u2019 orothers\u2019 preferences. The third and final test is whether the employer cannot make reasonable alternativeaccommodations, such as reassigning staff so that a woman does not have to work in a men-only part of a jailor other gender-specific facility. Privacy concerns are a major reason why discrimination based on gender isupheld by the courts, for example in situations such as hires for nursing or custodial staff (Manley, 2009). Mostcases of BFOQs are decided on a case-by-case basis and these court decisions inform policy and future casedecisions.WHAT DO YOU THINK?Hooters and BFOQ LawsFIGURE 13.13 Hooters restaurants only hire female wait staff. (credit: \u201cBemLoira BemDavassa\u201d/Flickr)The restaurant chain Hooters, which hires only women wait staff and has them dress in a sexually provocativemanner, is commonly cited as a discriminatory employer. The chain would argue that the women employees arean essential part of their business in that they market through sex appeal and the wait staff attract customers.Men have filed discrimination charges against Hooters in the past for not hiring them as wait staff simply becausethey are men. The chain has avoided a court decision on their hiring practices by settling out of court with theplaintiffs in each case. Do you think their practices violate the Civil Rights Act? See if you can apply the threecourt tests to this case and make a decision about whether a case that went to trial would find in favor of theplaintiff or the chain."

In organizational psychology, the focus is on social interactions and their effecton the individual and on the functioning of the organization. In this section, you will learn about the workorganizational psychologists have done to understand job satisfaction, different styles of management,different styles of leadership, organizational culture, and teamwork.Job SatisfactionSome people love their jobs, some people tolerate their jobs, and some people cannot stand their jobs. Jobsatisfaction describes the degree to which individuals enjoy their job. It was described by Edwin Locke (1976)as the state of feeling resulting from appraising one\u2019s job experiences. While job satisfaction results from bothhow we think about our work (our cognition) and how we feel about our work (our affect) (Saari & Judge, 2004),it is described in terms of affect. Job satisfaction is impacted by the work itself, our personality, and the culturewe come from and live in (Saari & Judge, 2004).Job satisfaction is typically measured after a change in an organization, such as a shift in the managementmodel, to assess how the change affects employees. It may also be routinely measured by an organization toassess one of many factors expected to affect the organization\u2019s performance. In addition, polling companieslike Gallup regularly measure job satisfaction on a national scale to gather broad information on the state ofthe economy and the workforce (Saad, 2012).Job satisfaction is measured using questionnaires that employees complete. Sometimes a single questionmight be asked in a very straightforward way to which employees respond using a rating scale, such as a Likertscale, which was discussed in the chapter on personality. A Likert scale (typically) provides five possibleanswers to a statement or question that allows respondents to indicate their positive-to-negative strength ofagreement or strength of feeling regarding the question or statement. Thus the possible responses to aquestion such as \u201cHow satisfied are you with your job today?\u201d might be \u201cVery satisfied,\u201d \u201cSomewhat satisfied,\u201d\u201cNeither satisfied, nor dissatisfied,\u201d \u201cSomewhat dissatisfied,\u201d and \u201cVery dissatisfied.\u201d More commonly thesurvey will ask a number of questions about the employee\u2019s satisfaction to determine more precisely why theyare satisfied or dissatisfied. Sometimes these surveys are created for specific jobs; at other times, they aredesigned to apply to any job. Job satisfaction can be measured at a global level, meaning how satisfied ingeneral the employee is with work, or at the level of specific factors intended to measure which aspects of thejob lead to satisfaction (Table 13.2).Factors Involved in Job Satisfaction and DissatisfactionFactorDescriptionAutonomyWork contentIndividual responsibility, control over decisionsVariety, challenge, role clarityCommunicationFeedbackTABLE 13.2"

In contrast, thereis only a weak correlation between pay level and job satisfaction (Judge, Piccolo, Podsakoff, Shaw, & Rich,2010). Judge et al. (2010) suggest that individuals adjust or adapt to higher pay levels: Higher pay no longerprovides the satisfaction the individual may have initially felt when their salary increased.Why should we care about job satisfaction? Or more specifically, why should an employer care about jobsatisfaction? Measures of job satisfaction are somewhat correlated with job performance; in particular, theyappear to relate to organizational citizenship or discretionary behaviors on the part of an employee thatfurther the goals of the organization (Judge & Kammeyer-Mueller, 2012). Job satisfaction is related to generallife satisfaction, although there has been limited research on how the two influence each other or whetherpersonality and cultural factors affect both job and general life satisfaction. One carefully controlled studysuggested that the relationship is reciprocal: Job satisfaction affects life satisfaction positively, and vice versa(Judge & Watanabe, 1993). Of course, organizations cannot control life satisfaction\u2019s influence on jobsatisfaction. Job satisfaction, specifically low job satisfaction, is also related to withdrawal behaviors, such asleaving a job or absenteeism (Judge & Kammeyer-Mueller, 2012). The relationship with turnover itself,however, is weak (Judge & Kammeyer-Mueller, 2012). Finally, it appears that job satisfaction is related toorganizational performance, which suggests that implementing organizational changes to improve employeejob satisfaction will improve organizational performance (Judge & Kammeyer-Mueller, 2012).There is opportunity for more research in the area of job satisfaction. For example, Weiss (2002) suggests thatthe concept of job satisfaction measurements have combined both emotional and cognitive concepts, andmeasurements would be more reliable and show better relationships with outcomes like performance if themeasurement of job satisfaction separated these two possible elements of job satisfaction.DIG DEEPERJob Satisfaction in Federal Government AgenciesA 2013 study of job satisfaction in the U.S. federal government found indexes of job satisfaction plummetingcompared to the private sector. The largest factor in the decline was satisfaction with pay, followed by trainingand development opportunities.

Its primary goal is to improve the federalgovernment\u2019s management. However, the results also provide information to those interested in obtaining"

The Office of Personnel Management also produces a report based on their survey:www.fedview.opm.gov.Job stress affects job satisfaction. Job stress, or job strain, is caused by specific stressors in an occupation.Stress can be an ambiguous term as it is used in common language. Stress is the perception and response ofan individual to events judged as overwhelming or threatening to the individual\u2019s well-being (Gyllensten &Palmer, 2005). The events themselves are the stressors. Stress is a result of an employee\u2019s perception that thedemands placed on them exceed their ability to meet them (Gyllensten & Palmer, 2005), such as having to fillmultiple roles in a job or life in general, workplace role ambiguity, lack of career progress, lack of job security,lack of control over work outcomes, isolation, work overload, discrimination, harassment, and bullying(Colligan & Higgins, 2005). The stressors are different for women than men and these differences are asignificant area of research (Gyllensten & Palmer, 2005). Job stress leads to poor employee health, jobperformance, and family life (Colligan & Higgins, 2005).As already mentioned, job insecurity contributes significantly to job stress. Two increasing threats to jobsecurity are downsizing events and corporate mergers. Businesses typically involve I-O psychologists inplanning for, implementing, and managing these types of organizational change.Downsizing is an increasingly common response to a business\u2019s pronounced failure to achieve profit goals,and it involves laying off a significant percentage of the company\u2019s employees. Industrial-organizationalpsychologists may be involved in all aspects of downsizing: how the news is delivered to employees (both thosebeing let go and those staying), how laid-off employees are supported (e.g., separation packages), and howretained employees are supported. The latter is important for the organization because downsizing eventsaffect the retained employee\u2019s intent to quit, organizational commitment, and job insecurity (Ugboro, 2006).In addition to downsizing as a way of responding to outside strains on a business, corporations often growlarger by combining with other businesses. This can be accomplished through a merger (i.e., the joining of twoorganizations of equal power and status) or an acquisition (i.e., one organization purchases the other). In anacquisition, the purchasing organization is usually the more powerful or dominant partner. In both cases,there is usually a duplication of services between the two companies, such as two accounting departments andtwo sales forces. Both departments must be merged, which commonly involves a reduction of staff (Figure13.14). This leads to organizational processes and stresses similar to those that occur in downsizing events.Mergers require determining how the organizational culture will change, to which employees also must adjust(van Knippenberg, van Knippenberg, Monden, & de Lima, 2002). There can be additional stress on workers asthey lose their connection to the old organization and try to make connections with the new combined group(Amiot, Terry, Jimmieson, & Callan, 2006). Research in this area focuses on understanding employee reactions"

We might commonly thinkabout work interfering with family, but it is also the case that family responsibilities may conflict with workobligations (Carlson, Kacmar, & Williams, 2000). Greenhaus and Beutell (1985) first identified three sources ofwork\u2013family conflicts:time devoted to work makes it difficult to fulfill requirements of family, or vice versa,\u2022\u2022 strain from participation in work makes it difficult to fulfill requirements of family, or vice versa, and\u2022 specific behaviors required by work make it difficult to fulfill the requirements of family, or vice versa.Women often have greater responsibility for family demands, including home care, child care, and caring foraging parents, yet men in the United States are increasingly assuming a greater share of domesticresponsibilities. However, research has documented that women report greater levels of stress fromwork\u2013family conflict (Gyllensten & Palmer, 2005).There are many ways to decrease work\u2013family conflict and improve people\u2019s job satisfaction (Posig & Kickul,2004). These include support in the home, which can take various forms: emotional (listening), practical (helpwith chores). Workplace support can include understanding supervisors, flextime, leave with pay, andtelecommuting. Flextime usually involves a requirement of core hours spent in the workplace around whichthe employee may schedule their arrival and departure from work to meet family demands. Telecommutinginvolves employees working at home and setting their own hours, which allows them to work during differentparts of the day, and to spend part of the day with their family; this may also be known as ecommuting,working remotely, flexible workspace, or simply working from home. Recall that Yahoo! had a policy of allowingemployees to telecommute and then rescinded the policy. There are also organizations that have onsitedaycare centers, and some companies even have onsite fitness centers and health clinics. In a study of theeffectiveness of different coping methods, Lapierre & Allen (2006) found practical support from home moreimportant than emotional support. They also found that immediate-supervisor support for a workersignificantly reduced work\u2013family conflict through such mechanisms as allowing an employee the flexibility"

In contrast, flextime did not help with coping and telecommuting actuallymade things worse, perhaps reflecting the fact that being at home intensifies the conflict between work andfamily because with the employee in the home, the demands of family are more evident.Posig & Kickul (2004) identify exemplar corporations with policies designed to reduce work\u2013family conflict.Examples include IBM\u2019s policy of three years of job-guaranteed leave after the birth of a child, LucentTechnologies offer of one year\u2019s childbirth leave at half pay, and SC Johnson\u2019s program of concierge servicesfor daytime errands.LINK TO LEARNINGThe Glassdoor website (http://openstax.org/l/glassdoor) posts job satisfaction reviews for different careers andorganizations. Use this site to research possible careers and/or organizations that interest you.Management and Organizational StructureA significant portion of I-O research focuses on management and human relations. Douglas McGregor (1960)combined scientific management (a theory of management that analyzes and synthesizes workflows with themain objective of improving economic efficiency, especially labor productivity) and human relations into thenotion of leadership behavior. His theory lays out two different styles called Theory X and Theory Y. In theTheory X approach to management, managers assume that most people dislike work and are not innately self-directed. Theory X managers perceive employees as people who prefer to be led and told which tasks toperform and when. Their employees have to be watched carefully to be sure that they work hard enough tofulfill the organization\u2019s goals. Theory X workplaces will often have employees punch a clock when arrivingand leaving the workplace: Tardiness is punished. Supervisors, not employees, determine whether anemployee needs to stay late, and even this decision would require someone higher up in the command chain toapprove the extra hours. Theory X supervisors will ignore employees\u2019 suggestions for improved efficiency andreprimand employees for speaking out of order. These supervisors blame efficiency failures on individualemployees rather than the systems or policies in place. Managerial goals are achieved through a system ofpunishments and threats rather than enticements and rewards. Managers are suspicious of employees\u2019motivations and always suspect selfish motivations for their behavior at work (e.g., being paid is their solemotivation for working).In the Theory Y approach, on the other hand, managers assume that most people seek inner satisfaction andfulfillment from their work. Employees function better under leadership that allows them to participate in, andprovide input about, setting their personal and work goals. In Theory Y workplaces, employees participate indecisions about prioritizing tasks; they may belong to teams that, once given a goal, decide themselves how itwill be accomplished. In such a workplace, employees are able to provide input on matters of efficiency andsafety. One example of Theory Y in action is the policy of Toyota production lines that allows any employee tostop the entire line if a defect or other issue appears, so that the defect can be fixed and its cause remedied(Toyota Motor Manufacturing, 2013). A Theory Y workplace will also meaningfully consult employees on anychanges to the work process or management system. In addition, the organization will encourage employees tocontribute their own ideas. McGregor (1960) characterized Theory X as the traditional method of managementused in the United States. He argued that a Theory Y approach was needed to improve organizational outputand the wellbeing of individuals. Table 13.3 summarizes how these two management approaches differ."

Goals are achieved through enticements and rewards.TABLE 13.3Another management style was described by Donald Clifton, who focused his research on how an organizationcan best use an individual\u2019s strengths, an approach he called strengths-based management. He and hiscolleagues interviewed 8,000 managers and concluded that it is important to focus on a person\u2019s strengths, nottheir weaknesses. A strength is a particular enduring talent possessed by an individual that allows them toprovide consistent, near-perfect performance in tasks involving that talent. Clifton argued that our strengthsprovide the greatest opportunity for growth (Buckingham & Clifton, 2001). An example of a strength is publicspeaking or the ability to plan a successful event. The strengths-based approach is very popular although itseffect on organization performance is not well-studied. However, Kaiser & Overfield (2011) found thatmanagers often neglected improving their weaknesses and overused their strengths, both of which interferedwith performance.Leadership is an important element of management. Leadership styles have been of major interest within I-Oresearch, and researchers have proposed numerous theories of leadership. Bass (1985) popularized anddeveloped the concepts of transactional leadership versus transformational leadership styles. In transactionalleadership, the focus is on supervision and organizational goals, which are achieved through a system ofrewards and punishments (i.e., transactions). Transactional leaders maintain the status quo: They aremanagers. This is in contrast to the transformational leader. People who have transformational leadershippossess four attributes to varying degrees: They are charismatic (highly liked role models), inspirational(optimistic about goal attainment), intellectually stimulating (encourage critical thinking and problemsolving), and considerate (Bass, Avolio, & Atwater, 1996).As women increasingly take on leadership roles in corporations, questions have arisen as to whether there aredifferences in leadership styles between men and women (Eagly, Johannesen-Schmidt, & van Engen, 2003).Eagly & Johnson (1990) conducted a meta-analysis to examine gender and leadership style. They found, to aslight but significant degree, that women tend to practice an interpersonal style of leadership (i.e., she focuseson the morale and welfare of the employees) and men practice a task-oriented style (i.e., he focuses onaccomplishing tasks). However, the differences were less pronounced when one looked only at organizationalstudies and excluded laboratory experiments or surveys that did not involve actual organizational leaders.Larger gender-related differences were observed when leadership style was categorized as democratic orautocratic, and these differences were consistent across all types of studies. The authors suggest thatsimilarities between genders in leadership styles are attributable to different genders needing to conform tothe organization\u2019s culture; additionally, they propose that gender-related differences reflect inherentdifferences in the strengths each gender brings to bear on leadership practice. In another meta-analysis ofleadership style, Eagly, Johannesen-Schmidt, & van Engen (2003) found that women tended to exhibit thecharacteristics of transformational leaders, while men were more likely to be transactional leaders. However,the differences are not absolute; for example, women were found to use methods of reward for performancemore often than men, which is a component of transactional leadership. The differences they found were"

As Eagly, Johannesen-Schmidt, & van Engen (2003) point out, research shows thattransformational leadership approaches are more effective than transactional approaches, although individualleaders typically exhibit elements of both approaches.A new and emerging area of research within psychology focuses on leadership and the relationship withleaders from the perspective of a follower. This \u201cfollowership\u201d research suggests that studies need to examinethe leader-follower relationship in both directions\u2014instead of focusing only on leadership\u2014to betterunderstand the dynamics of the relationship. Put differently, people are individuals, and because they aredifferent, there probably is no single best leadership-follower dynamic between leaders and followers. Forinstance, think about the differences between yourself and someone you know well. Do you respond the sameway to criticism? Maybe one of you likes a lot of structure and other seems to work best with less structure.Perhaps, one of you is ready to try a new restaurant at any time and the other prefers to go to the tried-and-trueplace that you\u2019ve visited so many times the servers know your order before you place it.Some early research has discovered that the characteristics of individual followers will result in different typesof relationships with a leader depending on the leadership style. It appears that not all leadership styles workwell with all follower types. One characteristic of followers, for example, is their degree of extroversion.Previous research suggests that individuals with a high degree of extroversion would need a larger amount ofinteraction with their leaders in order to function well; however, other research suggests this may notnecessarily be the case and instead other factors may be at work (Phillips & Bedeian; Bauer et al, 2006).Another characteristic of followers is their individual need for growth. For followers who have a strong desireto learn and grow within their organization, a leader who provides developmental opportunities might bebetter received than one who does not. In addition, for those followers who are low on growth and needstrength, leaders who push them to grow may make them less satisfied followers as they feel forced intofurther development and training, possibly signaling a lower level of achievement from their supervisor.Training for leaders in both helping employees who have a strong drive for growth and those who do notappears to be helpful in improving the relationship between both types of followers and their leaders (Schyns,Kroon, & Moors, 2008).Finally, an employee\u2019s need for leadership is an important component of the leader-follower relationship.Some individuals are significantly more autonomous than others and as a result do not respond as well toleaders who provide a lot of structure and rigidity of processes, in turn reducing the quality of theirrelationship with their leader. Other employees who are high in need for leadership have a better relationshipwith their leader if they are provided with a well-structured environment with clear responsibilities and littleambiguity in their work. These followers work best in situations where they feel they can comfortably performthe work with little requirement to think outside of the guidelines that have been provided. For theseindividuals, having a leader who is able to set a clear path forward for the employee with little need fordeviation promotes a strong positive leader-follower relationship (Felfe & Schyns, 2006).Goals, Teamwork and Work TeamsThe workplace today is rapidly changing due to a variety of factors, such as shifts in technology, economics,foreign competition, globalization, and workplace demographics. Organizations need to respond quickly tochanges in these factors. Many companies are responding to these changes by structuring their organizationsso that work can be delegated to work teams, which bring together diverse skills, experience, and expertise.This is in contrast to organizational structures that have individuals at their base (Naquin & Tynan, 2003). Inthe team-based approach, teams are brought together and given a specific task or goal to accomplish. Despitetheir burgeoning popularity, team structures do not always deliver greater productivity\u2014the work of teams isan active area of research (Naquin & Tynan, 2003).Why do some teams work well while others do not? There are many contributing factors. For example, teamscan mask team members that are not working (i.e., social loafing). Teams can be inefficient due to poor"

The popularity of teams may in part result from the team halo effect: Teams aregiven credit for their successes. but individuals within a team are blamed for team failures (Naquin & Tynan,2003). One aspect of team diversity is their gender mix. Researchers have explored whether gender mix has aneffect on team performance. On the one hand, diversity can introduce communication and interpersonal-relationship problems that hinder performance, but on the other hand diversity can also increase the team\u2019sskill set, which may include skills that can actually improve team member interactions. Hoogendoorn,Oosterbeek, & van Praag (2013) studied project teams in a university business school in which the gender mixof the teams was manipulated. They found that gender-balanced teams performed better, as measured bysales and profits, than teams made up mostly by men. The study did not have enough data to determine therelative performance of teams with more women than men. The study was unsuccessful in identifying whichmechanism (interpersonal relationships, learning, or skills mixes) accounted for performance improvement.There are three basic types of teams: problem resolution teams, creative teams, and tactical teams. Problemresolution teams are created for the purpose of solving a particular problem or issue; for example, thediagnostic teams at the Centers for Disease Control. Creative teams are used to develop innovative possibilitiesor solutions; for example, design teams for car manufacturers create new vehicle models. Tactical teams areused to execute a well-defined plan or objective, such as a police or FBI SWAT team handling a hostagesituation (Larson & LaFasto, 1989). One area of active research involves a fourth kind of team\u2014the virtualteam; these studies examine how groups of geographically disparate people brought together using digitalcommunications technology function (Powell, Piccoli, & Ives, 2004). Even before the COVID-19 pandemic,virtual teams were more common due to the growing globalization of organizations and the use of consultingand partnerships facilitated by digital communication.Organizational CultureEach company and organization has an organizational culture. Organizational culture encompasses thevalues, visions, hierarchies, norms, and interactions among its employees. It is how an organization is run,how it operates, and how it makes decisions\u2014the industry in which the organization participates may have aninfluence. Different departments within one company can develop their own subculture within theorganization\u2019s culture. Ostroff, Kinicki, and Tamkins (2003) identify three layers in organizational culture:observable artifacts, espoused values, and basic assumptions. Observable artifacts are the symbols, language(jargon, slang, and humor), narratives (stories and legends), and practices (rituals) that represent theunderlying cultural assumptions. Espoused values are concepts or beliefs that the management or the entireorganization endorses. They are the rules that allow employees to know which actions they should take indifferent situations and which information they should adhere to. These basic assumptions generally areunobservable and unquestioned. Researchers have developed survey instruments to measure organizationalculture.With the workforce being a global marketplace, your company may have a supplier in Korea and another inHonduras and have employees in the United States, China, and South Africa. You may have coworkers ofdifferent religious, ethnic, or racial backgrounds than yourself. Your coworkers may be from different placesaround the globe. Many workplaces offer diversity training to help everyone involved bridge and understandcultural differences. Diversity training educates participants about cultural differences with the goal ofimproving teamwork. There is always the potential for prejudice between members of two groups, but theevidence suggests that simply working together, particularly if the conditions of work are set carefully thatsuch prejudice can be reduced or eliminated. Pettigrew and Tropp (2006) conducted a meta-analysis toexamine the question of whether contact between groups reduced prejudice between those groups. They foundthat there was a moderate but significant effect. They also found that, as previously theorized, the effect wasenhanced when the two groups met under conditions in which they have equal standing, common goals,cooperation between the groups, and especially support on the part of the institution or authorities for thecontact."

Workers\u2019 expectations and attitudes are developed inpart by experience in particular cultural time periods. Generational constructs are somewhat arbitrary, yet theymay be helpful in setting broad directions to organizational management as one generation leaves the workforceand another enters it. The baby boomer generation (born between 1946 and 1964) is in the process of leavingthe workforce and will continue to depart it for a decade or more. Generation X (born between the early 1960sand the 1980s) are now in the middle of their careers. Millennials (born from 1979 to the early 1994) began tocome of age at the turn of the century, and are early in their careers.Today, as these three different generations work side by side in the workplace, employers and managers need tobe able to identify their unique characteristics. Each generation has distinctive expectations, habits, attitudes,and motivations (Elmore, 2010). One of the major differences among these generations is knowledge of the useof technology in the workplace. Millennials are technologically sophisticated and believe their use of technologysets them apart from other generations. They have also been characterized as self-centered and overly self-confident. Their attitudinal differences have raised concerns for managers about maintaining their motivation asemployees and their ability to integrate into organizational culture created by baby boomers (Myers &Sadaghiani, 2010). For example, millennials may expect to hear that they need to pay their dues in their jobsfrom baby boomers who believe they paid their dues in their time. Yet millennials may resist doing so becausethey value life outside of work to a greater degree (Myers & Sadaghiani, 2010). Meister & Willyerd (2010) suggestalternative approaches to training and mentoring that will engage millennials and adapt to their need forfeedback from supervisors: reverse mentoring, in which a younger employee educates a senior employee insocial media or other digital resources. The senior employee then has the opportunity to provide useful guidancewithin a less demanding role.Recruiting and retaining millennials and Generation X employees poses challenges that did not exist in previousgenerations. The concept of building a career with the company is not relatable to most Generation X employees,who do not expect to stay with one employer for their career. This expectation arises from of a reduced sense ofloyalty because they do not expect their employer to be loyal to them (Gibson, Greenwood, & Murphy, 2009).Retaining Generation X workers thus relies on motivating them by making their work meaningful (Gibson,Greenwood, & Murphy, 2009). Since millennials lack an inherent loyalty to the company, retaining them alsorequires effort in the form of nurturing through frequent rewards, praise, and feedback.Millennials are also interested in having many choices, including options in work scheduling, choice of job duties,and so on. They also expect more training and education from their employers. Companies that offer the bestbenefit package and brand attract millennials (Myers & Sadaghiani, 2010).One well-recognized negative aspect of organizational culture is a culture of harassment, including sexualharassment. Most organizations of any size have developed sexual harassment policies that define sexualharassment (or harassment in general) and the procedures the organization has set in place to prevent andaddress it when it does occur. Thus, in most jobs you have held, you were probably made aware of thecompany\u2019s sexual harassment policy and procedures, and may have received training related to the policy. TheU.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (n.d.) provides the following description of sexualharassment:Unwelcome sexual advances, requests for sexual favors, and other verbal or physical conduct of asexual nature constitute sexual harassment when this conduct explicitly or implicitly affects anindividual's employment, unreasonably interferes with an individual's work performance, or createsan intimidating, hostile, or offensive work environment.

Quid pro quo means you give something to getsomething, and it refers to a situation in which organizational rewards are offered in exchange for sexualfavors. Quid pro quo harassment is often between an employee and a person with greater power in theorganization. For example, a supervisor might request an action, such as a kiss or a touch, in exchange for apromotion, a positive performance review, or a pay raise. Another form of sexual harassment is the threat ofwithholding a reward if a sexual request is refused. Hostile environment sexual harassment is another type ofworkplace harassment. In this situation, an employee experiences conditions in the workplace that areconsidered hostile or intimidating. For example, a work environment that allows offensive language or jokes ordisplays sexually explicit images. Isolated occurrences of these events do not constitute harassment, but apattern of repeated occurrences does. In addition to violating organizational policies against sexualharassment, these forms of harassment are illegal.Harassment does not have to be sexual; it may be related to any of the protected classes in the statutesregulated by the EEOC: race, national origin, religion, or age.Violence in the WorkplaceWorkplace violence is any act or threat of physical violence, harassment, intimidation, or other threatening,disruptive behavior that occurs at the workplace. It ranges from threats and verbal abuse to physical assaultsand even homicide (Occupational Safety & Health Administration, 2014).There are different targets of workplace violence: a person could commit violence against coworkers,supervisors, or property. Warning signs often precede such actions: intimidating behavior, threats, sabotagingequipment, or radical changes in a coworker\u2019s behavior. Often there is intimidation and then escalation thatleads to even further escalation. It is important for employees to involve their immediate supervisor if theyever feel intimidated or unsafe.Murder is the second leading cause of death in the workplace. It is also the primary cause of death for womenin the workplace. Every year there are nearly two million workers who are physically assaulted or threatenedwith assault. Many are murdered in domestic violence situations by boyfriends or husbands who chose thewoman\u2019s workplace to commit their crimes.There are many triggers for workplace violence. A significant trigger is the feeling of being treated unfairly,unjustly, or disrespectfully. In a research experiment, Greenberg (1993) examined the reactions of studentswho were given pay for a task. In one group, the students were given extensive explanations for the pay rate. Inthe second group, the students were given a curt uninformative explanation. The students were made tobelieve the supervisor would not know how much money the student withdrew for payment. The rate ofstealing (taking more pay than they were told they deserved) was higher in the group who had been given thelimited explanation. This is a demonstration of the importance of procedural justice in organizations.Procedural justice refers to the fairness of the processes by which outcomes are determined in conflicts withor among employees.In another study by Greenberg & Barling (1999), they found a history of aggression and amount of alcoholconsumed to be accurate predictors of workplace violence against a coworker. Aggression against a supervisorwas predicted if a worker felt unfairly treated or untrusted. Job security and alcohol consumption predictedaggression against a subordinate. To understand and predict workplace violence, Greenberg & Barling (1999)emphasize the importance of considering the employee target of aggression or violence and characteristics ofboth the workplace characteristics and the aggressive or violent person."

This field is concerned with the integration of the human-machineinterface in the workplace, through design, and specifically with researching and designing machines that fithuman requirements. The integration may be physical or cognitive, or a combination of both. Anyone whoneeds to be convinced that the field is necessary need only try to operate an unfamiliar television remotecontrol or use a new piece of software for the first time. Whereas the two other areas of I-O psychology focus onthe interface between the worker and team, group, or organization, human factors psychology focuses on theindividual worker\u2019s interaction with a machine, work station, information displays, and the local environment,such as lighting. In the United States, human factors psychology has origins in both psychology andengineering; this is reflected in the early contributions of Lillian Gilbreth (psychologist and engineer) and herhusband Frank Gilbreth (engineer).Human factor professionals are involved in design from the beginning of a project, as is more common insoftware design projects, or toward the end in testing and evaluation, as is more common in traditionalindustries (Howell, 2003). Another important role of human factor professionals is in the development ofregulations and principles of best design. These regulations and principles are often related to work safety. Forexample, the Three Mile Island nuclear accident lead to Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) requirementsfor additional instrumentation in nuclear facilities to provide operators with more critical information andincreased operator training (United States Nuclear Regulatory Commission, 2013). The American NationalStandards Institute (ANSI, 2000), an independent developer of industrial standards, develops many standardsrelated to ergonomic design, such as the design of control-center workstations that are used for transportationcontrol or industrial process control.Many of the concerns of human factors psychology are related to workplace safety. These concerns can bestudied to help prevent work-related injuries of individual workers or those around them. Safety protocols mayalso be related to activities, such as commercial driving or flying, medical procedures, and law enforcement,that have the potential to impact the public.One of the methods used to reduce accidents in the workplace is a checklist. The airline industry is oneindustry that uses checklists. Pilots are required to go through a detailed checklist of the different parts of theaircraft before takeoff to ensure that all essential equipment is working correctly. Astronauts also go throughchecklists before takeoff. The surgical safety checklist shown in Figure 13.15 was developed by the WorldHealth Organization (WHO) and serves as the basis for many checklists at medical facilities."

The study examined a total of about 45,000 decisions made by 35 operators and4 managers over a period of 60 days. Their study found that as the number of decisions made per day by theoperators climbed, that is, as their cognitive effort increased, the operators made more mistakes in falselyidentifying incidents as real security breaches (when, in reality, they were not). Interestingly, the oppositemistake of identifying real intrusions as false alarms did not increase with increased cognitive demand. Thisappears to be good news for the bank, since false alarms are not as costly as incorrectly rejecting a genuinethreat. These kinds of studies combine research on attention, perception, teamwork, and human\u2013computerinteractions in a field of considerable societal and business significance. This is exactly the context of theevents that led to the massive data breach for Target in the fall of 2013. Indications are that security personnelreceived signals of a security breach but did not interpret them correctly, thus allowing the breach to continuefor two weeks until an outside agency, the FBI, informed the company (Riley, Elgin, Lawrence, & Matlack,2014)."

Organizational psychologists have alsostudied the effects of management styles and leadership styles on productivity. In addition to the employeesand management, organizational psychology also looks at the organizational culture and how that might affectproductivity. One aspect of organization culture is the prevention and addressing of sexual and other forms ofharassment in the workplace. Sexual harassment includes language, behavior, or displays that create a hostileenvironment; it also includes sexual favors requested in exchange for workplace rewards (i.e., quid pro quo).Industrial-organizational psychology has conducted extensive research on the triggers and causes ofworkplace violence and safety. This enables the organization to establish procedures that can identify thesetriggers before they become a problem."

A significant population of non-traditional college students may face additional stressors, such asraising children or holding down a full-time job while working toward a degree.Of course, life is filled with many additional challenges beyond those incurred in college or the workplace. Wemight have concerns with financial security, difficulties with friends or neighbors, family responsibilities, andwe may not have enough time to do the things we want to do. Even minor hassles\u2014losing things, traffic jams,and loss of internet service\u2014all involve pressure and demands that can make life seem like a struggle and thatcan compromise our sense of well-being. That is, all can be stressful in some way.Scientific interest in stress, including how we adapt and cope, has been longstanding in psychology; indeed,after nearly a century of research on the topic, much has been learned and many insights have beendeveloped. This chapter examines stress and highlights our current understanding of the phenomenon,including its psychological and physiological natures, its causes and consequences, and the steps we can taketo master stress rather than become its victim."

Today, we often use the term loosely indescribing a variety of unpleasant feeling states; for example, we often say we are stressed out when we feelfrustrated, angry, conflicted, overwhelmed, or fatigued. Despite the widespread use of the term, stress is afairly vague concept that is difficult to define with precision.Researchers have had a difficult time agreeing on an acceptable definition of stress. Some have conceptualizedstress as a demanding or threatening event or situation (e.g., a high-stress job, overcrowding, and longcommutes to work). Such conceptualizations are known as stimulus-based definitions because theycharacterize stress as a stimulus that causes certain reactions. Stimulus-based definitions of stress areproblematic, however, because they fail to recognize that people differ in how they view and react tochallenging life events and situations. For example, a conscientious student who has studied diligently allsemester would likely experience less stress during final exams week than would a less responsible,unprepared student.Others have conceptualized stress in ways that emphasize the physiological responses that occur when facedwith demanding or threatening situations (e.g., increased arousal). These conceptualizations are referred to asresponse-based definitions because they describe stress as a response to environmental conditions. Forexample, the endocrinologist Hans Selye, a famous stress researcher, once defined stress as the \u201cresponse ofthe body to any demand, whether it is caused by, or results in, pleasant or unpleasant conditions\u201d (Selye, 1976,p. 74). Selye\u2019s definition of stress is response-based in that it conceptualizes stress chiefly in terms of thebody\u2019s physiological reaction to any demand that is placed on it. Neither stimulus-based nor response-baseddefinitions provide a complete definition of stress. Many of the physiological reactions that occur when facedwith demanding situations (e.g., accelerated heart rate) can also occur in response to things that most peoplewould not consider to be genuinely stressful, such as receiving unanticipated good news: an unexpectedpromotion or raise.A useful way to conceptualize stress is to view it as a process whereby an individual perceives and responds toevents that they appraise as overwhelming or threatening to their well-being (Lazarus & Folkman, 1984). Acritical element of this definition is that it emphasizes the importance of how we appraise\u2014that is,judge\u2014demanding or threatening events (often referred to as stressors); these appraisals, in turn, influenceour reactions to such events. Two kinds of appraisals of a stressor are especially important in this regard:primary and secondary appraisals. A primary appraisal involves judgment about the degree of potential harmor threat to well-being that a stressor might entail. A stressor would likely be appraised as a threat if oneanticipates that it could lead to some kind of harm, loss, or other negative consequence; conversely, a stressorwould likely be appraised as a challenge if one believes that it carries the potential for gain or personal growth.For example, an employee who is promoted to a leadership position would likely perceive the promotion as amuch greater threat if they believed the promotion would lead to excessive work demands than if they viewedit as an opportunity to gain new skills and grow professionally. Similarly, a college student on the cusp ofgraduation may face the change as a threat or a challenge (Figure 14.2)."

(credit: Timothy Zanker)The perception of a threat triggers a secondary appraisal: judgment of the options available to cope with astressor, as well as perceptions of how effective such options will be (Lyon, 2012) (Figure 14.3). As you mayrecall from what you learned about self-efficacy, an individual\u2019s belief in their ability to complete a task isimportant (Bandura, 1994). A threat tends to be viewed as less catastrophic if one believes something can bedone about it (Lazarus & Folkman, 1984). Imagine that two middle-aged people, Robin and Madhuri, performbreast self-examinations one morning and each notices a lump on the lower region of their left breast.Although both view the breast lump as a potential threat (primary appraisal), their secondary appraisals differconsiderably. In considering the breast lump, some of the thoughts racing through Robin\u2019s mind are, \u201cOh myGod, I could have breast cancer! What if the cancer has spread to the rest of my body and I cannot recover?What if I have to go through chemotherapy? I\u2019ve heard that experience is awful! What if I have to quit my job?My partner and I won\u2019t have enough money to pay the mortgage. Oh, this is just horrible\u2026I can\u2019t deal with it!\u201dOn the other hand, Madhuri thinks, \u201cHmm, this may not be good. Although most times these things turn out tobe benign, I need to have it checked out. If it turns out to be breast cancer, there are doctors who can take careof it because the medical technology today is quite advanced. I\u2019ll have a lot of different options, and I\u2019ll be justfine.\u201d Clearly, Robin and Madhuri have different outlooks on what might turn out to be a very serious situation:Robin seems to think that little could be done about it, whereas Madhuri believes that, worst case scenario, anumber of options that are likely to be effective would be available. As such, Robin would clearly experiencegreater stress than would Madhuri."

Stress is likely to result if a stressor isperceived as extremely threatening or threatening with few or no effective coping options available.To be sure, some stressors are inherently more stressful than others in that they are more threatening andleave less potential for variation in cognitive appraisals (e.g., objective threats to one\u2019s health or safety).Nevertheless, appraisal will still play a role in augmenting or diminishing our reactions to such events (Everly& Lating, 2002).If a person appraises an event as harmful and believes that the demands imposed by the event exceed theavailable resources to manage or adapt to it, the person will subjectively experience a state of stress. Incontrast, if one does not appraise the same event as harmful or threatening, she is unlikely to experiencestress. According to this definition, environmental events trigger stress reactions by the way they areinterpreted and the meanings they are assigned. In short, stress is largely in the eye of the beholder: it\u2019s not somuch what happens to you as it is how you respond (Selye, 1976).Good Stress?Although stress carries a negative connotation, at times it may be of some benefit. Stress can motivate us to dothings in our best interests, such as study for exams, visit the doctor regularly, exercise, and perform to thebest of our ability at work.

This kind of stress,which Selye called eustress (from the Greek eu= \u201cgood\u201d), is a good kind of stress associated with positivefeelings, optimal health, and performance. A moderate amount of stress can be beneficial in challengingsituations. For example, athletes may be motivated and energized by pregame stress, and students mayexperience similar beneficial stress before a major exam. Indeed, research shows that moderate stress canenhance both immediate and delayed recall of educational material. Participants in one study who memorizeda scientific text passage showed improved memory of the passage immediately after exposure to a mildstressor as well as one day following exposure to the stressor (Hupbach & Fieman, 2012).Increasing one\u2019s level of stress will cause performance to change in a predictable way. As shown in Figure 14.4,as stress increases, so do performance and general well-being (eustress); when stress levels reach an optimallevel (the highest point of the curve), performance reaches its peak. A person at this stress level is colloquiallyat the top of their game, meaning they feel fully energized, focused, and can work with minimal effort andmaximum efficiency. But when stress exceeds this optimal level, it is no longer a positive force\u2014it becomesexcessive and debilitating, or what Selye termed distress (from the Latin dis= \u201cbad\u201d). People who reach thislevel of stress feel burned out; they are fatigued, exhausted, and their performance begins to decline. If thestress remains excessive, health may begin to erode as well (Everly & Lating, 2002). A good example of distressis severe test anxiety. When students are feeling very stressed about a test, negative emotions combined withphysical symptoms may make concentration difficult, thereby negatively affecting test scores.FIGURE 14.4 As the stress level increases from low to moderate, so does performance (eustress). At the optimallevel (the peak of the curve), performance has reached its peak. If stress exceeds the optimal level, it will reach thedistress region, where it will become excessive and debilitating, and performance will decline (Everly & Lating,2002).The Prevalence of StressStress is everywhere and, as shown in Figure 14.5, it has been on the rise over the last several years. Each of usis acquainted with stress\u2014some are more familiar than others. In many ways, stress feels like a load you justcan\u2019t carry\u2014a feeling you experience when, for example, you have to drive somewhere in a blizzard, when youwake up late the morning of an important job interview, when you run out of money before the next payperiod, and before taking an important exam for which you realize you are not fully prepared."

Although stress can be positive at times, it can have deleterious health implications,contributing to the onset and progression of a variety of physical illnesses and diseases (Cohen & Herbert,1996).The scientific study of how stress and other psychological factors impact health falls within the realm of healthpsychology, a subfield of psychology devoted to understanding the importance of psychological influences onhealth, illness, and how people respond when they become ill (Taylor, 1999). Health psychology emerged as adiscipline in the 1970s, a time during which there was increasing awareness of the role behavioral and lifestylefactors play in the development of illnesses and diseases (Straub, 2007). In addition to studying the connectionbetween stress and illness, health psychologists investigate issues such as why people make certain lifestylechoices (e.g., smoking or eating unhealthy food despite knowing the potential adverse health implications ofsuch behaviors). Health psychologists also design and investigate the effectiveness of interventions aimed atchanging unhealthy behaviors. Perhaps one of the more fundamental tasks of health psychologists is toidentify which groups of people are especially at risk for negative health outcomes, based on psychological orbehavioral factors. For example, measuring differences in stress levels among demographic groups and howthese levels change over time can help identify populations who may have an increased risk for illness ordisease.Figure 14.6 depicts the results of three national surveys in which several thousand individuals from differentdemographic groups completed a brief stress questionnaire; the surveys were administered in 1983, 2006,and 2009 (Cohen & Janicki-Deverts, 2012). All three surveys demonstrated higher stress in women than inmen. Unemployed individuals reported high levels of stress in all three surveys, as did those with lesseducation and income; retired persons reported the lowest stress levels. However, from 2006 to 2009 thegreatest increase in stress levels occurred among men, Hispanic people aged 45\u201364, college graduates, andthose with full-time employment. One interpretation of these findings is that concerns surrounding the2008\u20132009 economic downturn (e.g., threat of or actual job loss and substantial loss of retirement savings)may have been especially stressful to college-educated employed men with limited time remaining in theirworking careers."

One of the early pioneers in thestudy of stress was Walter Cannon, an eminent American physiologist at Harvard Medical School (Figure 14.7).In the early part of the 20th century, Cannon was the first to identify the body\u2019s physiological reactions tostress."

At onepoint during your hike, a large, frightening-looking black bear appears from behind a stand of trees and sitsabout 50 yards from you. The bear notices you, sits up, and begins to lumber in your direction. In addition tothinking, \u201cThis is definitely not good,\u201d a constellation of physiological reactions begins to take place inside you.Prompted by a deluge of epinephrine (adrenaline) and norepinephrine (noradrenaline) from your adrenalglands, your pupils begin to dilate. Your heart starts to pound and speeds up, you begin to breathe heavily andperspire, you get butterflies in your stomach, and your muscles become tense, preparing you to take some kindof direct action. Cannon proposed that this reaction, which he called the fight-or-flight response, occurs whena person experiences very strong emotions\u2014especially those associated with a perceived threat (Cannon,1932). During the fight-or-flight response, the body is rapidly aroused by activation of both the sympatheticnervous system and the endocrine system (Figure 14.8). This arousal helps prepare the person to either fightor flee from a perceived threat.FIGURE 14.8 Fight or flight is a physiological response to a stressor.According to Cannon, the fight-or-flight response is a built-in mechanism that assists in maintaining"

Thus, Cannon viewed the fight-or-flightresponse as adaptive because it enables people to adjust internally and externally to threats in theirenvironment, allowing them to continue to be alive and overcome the threat.Selye and the General Adaptation SyndromeAnother important early contributor to the stress field was Hans Selye, mentioned earlier. He would eventuallybecome one of the world\u2019s foremost experts in the study of stress (Figure 14.9). As a young assistant in thebiochemistry department at McGill University in the 1930s, Selye was engaged in research involving sexhormones in rats. Although he was unable to find an answer for what he was initially researching, heincidentally discovered that when exposed to prolonged negative stimulation (stressors)\u2014such as extremecold, surgical injury, excessive muscular exercise, and shock\u2014the rats showed signs of adrenal enlargement,thymus and lymph node shrinkage, and stomach ulceration. Selye realized that these responses were triggeredby a coordinated series of physiological reactions that unfold over time during continued exposure to astressor. These physiological reactions were nonspecific, which means that regardless of the type of stressor,the same pattern of reactions would occur. What Selye discovered was the general adaptation syndrome, thebody\u2019s nonspecific physiological response to stress.FIGURE 14.9 Hans Selye specialized in research about stress. In 2009, his native Hungary honored his work withthis stamp, released in conjunction with the 2nd annual World Conference on Stress.The general adaptation syndrome, shown in Figure 14.10, consists of three stages: (1) alarm reaction, (2) stageof resistance, and (3) stage of exhaustion (Selye, 1936; 1976). Alarm reaction describes the body\u2019s immediatereaction upon facing a threatening situation or emergency, and it is roughly analogous to the fight-or-flightresponse described by Cannon. During an alarm reaction, you are alerted to a stressor, and your body alarmsyou with a cascade of physiological reactions that provide you with the energy to manage the situation. Aperson who wakes up in the middle of the night to discover her house is on fire, for example, is experiencing analarm reaction.FIGURE 14.10 The three stages of Selye\u2019s general adaptation syndrome are shown in this graph. Prolonged stressultimately results in exhaustion."

        "data": "Page 494494 14 \u2022 Stress, Lifestyle, and HealthIf exposure to a stressor is prolonged, the organism will enter the stage of resistance. During this stage, theinitial shock of alarm reaction has worn off and the body has adapted to the stressor. Nevertheless, the bodyalso remains on alert and is prepared to respond as it did during the alarm reaction, although with lessintensity. For example, suppose a child who went missing is still missing 72 hours later. Although the parentswould obviously remain extremely disturbed, the magnitude of physiological reactions would likely havediminished over the 72 intervening hours due to some adaptation to this event.If exposure to a stressor continues over a longer period of time, the stage of exhaustion ensues. At this stage,the person is no longer able to adapt to the stressor: the body\u2019s ability to resist becomes depleted as physicalwear takes its toll on the body\u2019s tissues and organs. As a result, illness, disease, and other permanent damageto the body\u2014even death\u2014may occur. If a missing child still remained missing after three months, the long-term stress associated with this situation may cause a parent to literally faint with exhaustion at some point oreven to develop a serious and irreversible illness.In short, Selye\u2019s general adaptation syndrome suggests that stressors tax the body via a three-phaseprocess\u2014an initial jolt, subsequent readjustment, and a later depletion of all physical resources\u2014thatultimately lays the groundwork for serious health problems and even death. It should be pointed out, however,that this model is a response-based conceptualization of stress, focusing exclusively on the body\u2019s physicalresponses while largely ignoring psychological factors such as appraisal and interpretation of threats.Nevertheless, Selye\u2019s model has had an enormous impact on the field of stress because it offers a generalexplanation for how stress can lead to physical damage and, thus, disease. As we shall discuss later, prolongedor repeated stress has been implicated in development of a number of disorders such as hypertension andcoronary artery disease.The Physiological Basis of StressWhat goes on inside our bodies when we experience stress? The physiological mechanisms of stress areextremely complex, but they generally involve the work of two systems\u2014the sympathetic nervous system andthe hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis. When a person first perceives something as stressful (Selye\u2019salarm reaction), the sympathetic nervous system triggers arousal via the release of adrenaline from theadrenal glands. Release of these hormones activates the fight-or-flight responses to stress, such as acceleratedheart rate and respiration. At the same time, the HPA axis, which is primarily endocrine in nature, becomesespecially active, although it works much more slowly than the sympathetic nervous system. In response tostress, the hypothalamus (one of the limbic structures in the brain) releases corticotropin-releasing factor, ahormone that causes the pituitary gland to release adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) (Figure 14.11). TheACTH then activates the adrenal glands to secrete a number of hormones into the bloodstream; an importantone is cortisol, which can affect virtually every organ within the body. Cortisol is commonly known as a stresshormone and helps provide that boost of energy when we first encounter a stressor, preparing us to run awayor fight. However, sustained elevated levels of cortisol weaken the immune system."

However, extended release ofcortisol\u2014as would happen with prolonged or chronic stress\u2014often comes at a high price. High levels of cortisolhave been shown to produce a number of harmful effects. For example, increases in cortisol can significantlyweaken our immune system (Glaser & Kiecolt-Glaser, 2005), and high levels are frequently observed amongdepressed individuals (Geoffroy, Hertzman, Li, & Power, 2013). In summary, a stressful event causes a varietyof physiological reactions that activate the adrenal glands, which in turn release epinephrine, norepinephrine,and cortisol. These hormones affect a number of bodily processes in ways that prepare the stressed person totake direct action, but also in ways that may heighten the potential for illness.When stress is extreme or chronic, it can have profoundly negative consequences. For example, stress oftencontributes to the development of certain psychological disorders, including post-traumatic stress disorder,major depressive disorder, and other serious psychiatric conditions. Additionally, we noted earlier that stressis linked to the development and progression of a variety of physical illnesses and diseases. For example,researchers in one study found that people injured during the September 11, 2001, World Trade Centerdisaster or who developed post-traumatic stress symptoms afterward later suffered significantly elevated ratesof heart disease (Jordan, Miller-Archie, Cone, Morabia, & Stellman, 2011). Another investigation yielded thatself-reported stress symptoms among aging and retired Finnish food industry workers were associated withmorbidity 11 years later. This study also predicted the onset of musculoskeletal, nervous system, andendocrine and metabolic disorders (Salonen, Arola, Nyg\u00e5rd, & Huhtala, 2008). Another study reported thatmale South Korean manufacturing employees who reported high levels of work-related stress were more likelyto catch the common cold over the next several months than were those employees who reported lower work-related stress levels (Park et al., 2011). Later, you will explore the mechanisms through which stress canproduce physical illness and disease."

In general, stressors canbe placed into one of two broad categories: chronic and acute. Chronic stressors include events that persistover an extended period of time, such as caring for a parent with dementia, long-term unemployment, orimprisonment. Acute stressors involve brief focal events that sometimes continue to be experienced asoverwhelming well after the event has ended, such as falling on an icy sidewalk and breaking your leg (Cohen,Janicki-Deverts, & Miller, 2007). Whether chronic or acute, potential stressors come in many shapes and sizes.They can include major traumatic events, significant life changes, daily hassles, as well as other situations inwhich a person is regularly exposed to threat, challenge, or danger.Traumatic EventsSome stressors involve traumatic events or situations in which a person is exposed to actual or threateneddeath or serious injury. Stressors in this category include exposure to military combat, threatened or actualphysical assaults (e.g., physical attacks, sexual assault, robbery, childhood abuse), terrorist attacks, naturaldisasters (e.g., earthquakes, floods, hurricanes), and automobile accidents. Men, non-White people, andindividuals in lower socioeconomic status (SES) groups report experiencing a greater number of traumaticevents than do women, White people, and individuals in higher SES groups (Hatch & Dohrenwend, 2007).Some individuals who are exposed to stressors of extreme magnitude develop post-traumatic stress disorder(PTSD): a chronic stress reaction characterized by experiences and behaviors that may include intrusive andpainful memories of the stressor event, jumpiness, persistent negative emotional states, detachment fromothers, angry outbursts, and avoidance of reminders of the event (American Psychiatric Association [APA],2013).Life ChangesMost stressors that we encounter are not nearly as intense as the ones described above. Many potentialstressors we face involve events or situations that require us to make changes in our ongoing lives and requiretime as we adjust to those changes. Examples include death of a close family member, marriage, divorce, andmoving (Figure 14.12).FIGURE 14.12 Some fairly typical life events, such as moving, can be significant stressors.

(credit: \"Jellaluna\"/Flickr)In the 1960s, psychiatrists Thomas Holmes and Richard Rahe wanted to examine the link between lifestressors and physical illness, based on the hypothesis that life events requiring significant changes in aperson\u2019s normal life routines are stressful, whether these events are desirable or undesirable. They developedthe Social Readjustment Rating Scale (SRRS), consisting of 43 life events that require varying degrees ofpersonal readjustment (Holmes & Rahe, 1967). Many life events that most people would consider pleasant(e.g., holidays, retirement, marriage) are among those listed on the SRRS; these are examples of eustress.Holmes and Rahe also proposed that life events can add up over time, and that experiencing a cluster ofstressful events increases one\u2019s risk of developing physical illnesses.In developing their scale, Holmes and Rahe asked 394 participants to provide a numerical estimate for each ofthe 43 items; each estimate corresponded to how much readjustment participants felt each event wouldrequire. These estimates resulted in mean value scores for each event\u2014often called life change units (LCUs)(Rahe, McKeen, & Arthur, 1967). The numerical scores ranged from 11 to 100, representing the perceivedmagnitude of life change each event entails. Death of a spouse ranked highest on the scale with 100 LCUs, anddivorce ranked second highest with 73 LCUs. In addition, personal injury or illness, marriage, and jobtermination also ranked highly on the scale with 53, 50, and 47 LCUs, respectively. Conversely, change inresidence (20 LCUs), change in eating habits (15 LCUs), and vacation (13 LCUs) ranked low on the scale (Table14.1). Minor violations of the law ranked the lowest with 11 LCUs. To complete the scale, participants checkedyes for events experienced within the last 12 months. LCUs for each checked item are totaled for a scorequantifying the amount of life change. Agreement on the amount of adjustment required by the various lifeevents on the SRRS is highly consistent, even cross-culturally (Holmes & Masuda, 1974).Some Stressors on the Social Readjustment Rating Scale (Holmes & Rahe, 1967)Life eventLife change unitsDeath of a close family memberPersonal injury or illnessDismissal from workChange in financial stateChange to different line of workOutstanding personal achievementBeginning or ending schoolChange in living conditionsChange in working hours or conditionsChange in residenceChange in schoolsChange in social activitiesChange in sleeping habitsTABLE 14.163534738362826252020201816"

In an earlydemonstration, researchers obtained LCU scores for U.S. and Norwegian Navy personnel who were about toembark on a six-month voyage. A later examination of medical records revealed positive (but small)correlations between LCU scores prior to the voyage and subsequent illness symptoms during the ensuing six-month journey (Rahe, 1974). In addition, people tend to experience more physical symptoms, such asbackache, upset stomach, diarrhea, and acne, on specific days in which self-reported LCU values areconsiderably higher than normal, such as the day of a family member\u2019s wedding (Holmes & Holmes, 1970).The Social Readjustment Rating Scale (SRRS) provides researchers a simple, easy-to-administer way ofassessing the amount of stress in people\u2019s lives, and it has been used in hundreds of studies (Thoits, 2010).Despite its widespread use, the scale has been subject to criticism. First, many of the items on the SRRS arevague; for example, death of a close friend could involve the death of a long-absent childhood friend thatrequires little social readjustment (Dohrenwend, 2006). In addition, some have challenged its assumption thatundesirable life events are no more stressful than desirable ones (Derogatis & Coons, 1993). However, most ofthe available evidence suggests that, at least as far as mental health is concerned, undesirable or negativeevents are more strongly associated with poor outcomes (such as depression) than are desirable, positiveevents (Hatch & Dohrenwend, 2007). Perhaps the most serious criticism is that the scale does not take intoconsideration respondents\u2019 appraisals of the life events it contains. As you recall, appraisal of a stressor is akey element in the conceptualization and overall experience of stress. Being fired from work may bedevastating to some but a welcome opportunity to obtain a better job for others. The SRRS remains one of themost well-known instruments in the study of stress, and it is a useful tool for identifying potential stress-related health outcomes (Scully et al., 2000).LINK TO LEARNINGGo to this site and complete the SRRS scale (http://openstax.org/l/SRRS) to determine the total number of LCUsyou have experienced over the last year.CONNECT THE CONCEPTSCorrelational ResearchThe Holmes and Rahe Social Readjustment Rating Scale (SRRS) uses the correlational research method to identifythe connection between stress and health. That is, respondents\u2019 LCU scores are correlated with the number orfrequency of self-reported symptoms indicating health problems. These correlations are typically positive\u2014as LCUscores increase, the number of symptoms increase. Consider all the thousands of studies that have used this scaleto correlate stress and illness symptoms: If you were to assign an average correlation coefficient to this body ofresearch, what would be your best guess? How strong do you think the correlation coefficient would be? Why can\u2019tthe SRRS show a causal relationship between stress and illness? If it were possible to show causation, do you thinkstress causes illness or illness causes stress?"

Daily hassles\u2014the minor irritations andannoyances that are part of our everyday lives (e.g., rush hour traffic, lost keys, obnoxious coworkers,inclement weather, arguments with friends or family)\u2014can build on one another and leave us just as stressedas life change events (Figure 14.13) (Kanner, Coyne, Schaefer, & Lazarus, 1981).14.2 \u2022 Stressors 499FIGURE 14.13 Daily commutes, whether (a) on the road or (b) via public transportation, can be hassles thatcontribute to our feelings of everyday stress. (credit a: modification of work by Jeff Turner; credit b: modification ofwork by \"epSos.de\"/Flickr)Researchers have demonstrated that the frequency of daily hassles is actually a better predictor of bothphysical and psychological health than are life change units. In a well-known study of San Francisco residents,the frequency of daily hassles was found to be more strongly associated with physical health problems thanwere life change events (DeLongis, Coyne, Dakof, Folkman, & Lazarus, 1982). In addition, daily minor hassles,especially interpersonal conflicts, often lead to negative and distressed mood states (Bolger, DeLongis, Kessler,& Schilling, 1989). Cyber hassles that occur on social media may represent a modern and evolving source ofstress. In one investigation, social media stress was tied to loss of sleep in adolescents, presumably becauseruminating about social media caused a physiological stress response that increased arousal (van der Schuur,Baumgartner, & Sumter, 2018). Clearly, daily hassles can add up and take a toll on us both emotionally andphysically.OCCUPATION-RELATED StressorsStressors can include situations in which one is frequently exposed to challenging and unpleasant events,such as difficult, demanding, or unsafe working conditions. Although most jobs and occupations can at timesbe demanding, some are clearly more stressful than others (Figure 14.14). For example, most people wouldlikely agree that a firefighter\u2019s work is inherently more stressful than that of a florist. Equally likely, most wouldagree that jobs containing various unpleasant elements, such as those requiring exposure to loud noise (heavyequipment operator), constant harassment and threats of physical violence (prison guard), perpetualfrustration (bus driver in a major city), or those mandating that an employee work alternating day and nightshifts (hotel desk clerk), are much more demanding\u2014and thus, more stressful\u2014than those that do not containsuch elements. Table 14.2 lists several occupations and some of the specific stressors associated with thoseoccupations (Sulsky & Smith, 2005)."

Job strain can have adverse consequences on both physical and mental health;it has been shown to be associated with increased risk of hypertension (Schnall & Landsbergis, 1994), heartattacks (Theorell et al., 1998), recurrence of heart disease after a first heart attack (Aboa-\u00c9boul\u00e9 et al., 2007),significant weight loss or gain (Kivim\u00e4ki et al., 2006), and major depressive disorder (Stansfeld, Shipley, Head,& Fuhrer, 2012). A longitudinal study of over 10,000 British civil servants reported that workers under 50 yearsold who earlier had reported high job strain were 68% more likely to later develop heart disease than werethose workers under 50 years old who reported little job strain (Chandola et al., 2008).Some people who are exposed to chronically stressful work conditions can experience job burnout, which is ageneral sense of emotional exhaustion and cynicism in relation to one\u2019s job (Maslach & Jackson, 1981). Jobburnout occurs frequently among those in human service jobs (e.g., social workers, teachers, therapists, andpolice officers). Job burnout consists of three dimensions. The first dimension is exhaustion\u2014a sense thatone\u2019s emotional resources are drained or that one is at the end of their rope and has nothing more to give at apsychological level. Second, job burnout is characterized by depersonalization: a sense of emotionaldetachment between the worker and the recipients of their services, often resulting in callous, cynical, orindifferent attitudes toward these individuals. Third, job burnout is characterized by diminished personalaccomplishment, which is the tendency to evaluate one\u2019s work negatively by, for example, experiencingdissatisfaction with one\u2019s job-related accomplishments or feeling as though one has categorically failed toinfluence others\u2019 lives through one\u2019s work.Job strain appears to be one of the greatest risk factors leading to job burnout, which is most commonlyobserved in workers who are older (ages 55\u201364), unmarried, and whose jobs involve manual labor. Heavyalcohol consumption, physical inactivity, being overweight, and having a physical or lifetime mental disorderare also associated with job burnout (Ahola, et al., 2006). In addition, depression often co-occurs with jobburnout. One large-scale study of over 3,000 Finnish employees reported that half of the participants withsevere job burnout had some form of depressive disorder (Ahola et al., 2005). Job burnout is often precipitatedby feelings of having invested considerable energy, effort, and time into one\u2019s work while receiving little inreturn (e.g., little respect or support from others or low pay) (Tatris, Peeters, Le Blanc, Schreurs, & Schaufeli,2001).As an illustration, consider Tyre, a nursing assistant who worked in a nursing home. Tyre worked long hoursfor little pay in a difficult facility. Tyre's supervisor was domineering, unpleasant, and unsupportive, as well asdisrespectful of Tyre's personal time, frequently informing them at the last minute they must work severaladditional hours after their shift ended or report to work on weekends. Tyre had very little autonomy at work.They had little input in day-to-day duties and how to perform them, and was not permitted to take breaksunless explicitly told by their supervisor. Tyre did not feel as though their hard work was appreciated, either bysupervisory staff or by the residents of the home. Tyre was very unhappy over the low pay, and felt that manyof the residents treated them disrespectfully.After several years, Tyre began to hate their job. Tyre dreaded going to work in the morning, and graduallydeveloped a callous, hostile attitude toward many of the residents. Eventually, they began to feel they could nolonger help the nursing home residents. Tyre\u2019s absenteeism from work increased, and one day they decidedthat they had had enough and quit. Tyre now has a job in sales, vowing never to work in nursing again.LINK TO LEARNINGWatch this clip from the 1999 comedy Office Spacefor a humorous illustration of lack of supervisory support(http://openstax.org/l/officespace) in which a sympathetic character\u2019s insufferable boss makes a last-minutedemand that he \u201cgo ahead and come in\u201d to the office on both Saturday and Sunday.Finally, our close relationships with friends and family\u2014particularly the negative aspects of theserelationships\u2014can be a potent source of stress.

As stress researcher Robert Sapolsky (1998) describes,stress-related disease emerges, predominantly, out of the fact that we so often activate a physiologicalsystem that has evolved for responding to acute physical emergencies, but we turn it on for months onend, worrying about mortgages, relationships, and promotions. (p. 6)The stress response, as noted earlier, consists of a coordinated but complex system of physiological reactionsthat are called upon as needed. These reactions are beneficial at times because they prepare us to deal withpotentially dangerous or threatening situations (for example, recall our old friend, the fearsome bear on thetrail). However, health is affected when physiological reactions are sustained, as can happen in response toongoing stress.Psychophysiological DisordersIf the reactions that compose the stress response are chronic or if they frequently exceed normal ranges, theycan lead to cumulative wear and tear on the body, in much the same way that running your air conditioner onfull blast all summer will eventually cause wear and tear on it. For example, the high blood pressure that aperson under considerable job strain experiences might eventually take a toll on their heart and set the stagefor a heart attack or heart failure. Also, someone exposed to high levels of the stress hormone cortisol mightbecome vulnerable to infection or disease because of weakened immune system functioning (McEwen, 1998).LINK TO LEARNINGNeuroscientists Robert Sapolsky and Carol Shively have conducted extensive research on stress in non-humanprimates for over 30 years. Both have shown that position in the social hierarchy predicts stress, mental healthstatus, and disease. Their research sheds light on how stress may lead to negative health outcomes forstigmatized or ostracized people. Here are two videos featuring Dr. Sapolsky: one is regarding killer stress(http://openstax.org/l/sapolsky1) and the other is an excellent in-depth documentary (http://openstax.org/l/sapolsky2) from National Geographic.Physical disorders or diseases whose symptoms are brought about or worsened by stress and emotionalfactors are called psychophysiological disorders.

They proposed the existence of disease-prone personality characteristics, including depression,anger/hostility, and anxiety. Indeed, a study of over 61,000 Norwegians identified depression as a risk factorfor all major disease-related causes of death (Mykletun et al., 2007). In addition, neuroticism\u2014a personalitytrait that reflects how anxious, moody, and sad one is\u2014has been identified as a risk factor for chronic healthproblems and mortality (Ploubidis & Grundy, 2009).Below, we discuss two kinds of psychophysiological disorders about which a great deal is known:cardiovascular disorders and asthma. First, however, it is necessary to turn our attention to a discussion of theimmune system\u2014one of the major pathways through which stress and emotional factors can lead to illness anddisease.EVERYDAY CONNECTIONSocial Status, Stress, and Health CarePsychologists have long been aware that social status (e.g., wealth, privilege) is intimately tied to stress, health,and well-being. Some factors that contribute to high stress and poor health among people with lower socialstatus include lack of control and predictability (e.g., greater unemployment) and resource inequality (e.g., lessaccess to health care and other community resources) (Marmot & Sapolsky, 2014).In the United States, resource inequalities tied to social status often create race and gender differences in healthcare. For example, African American women have the highest rates of emergency room visits and unmet healthcare needs compared to any other group, and this disparity increased significantly from 2006 to 2014 (Manuel,2018). Lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender youth often experience poor quality of care as a result of stigma,lack of understanding, and insensitivity among health care professionals (Hafeez, Zeshan, Tahir, Jahan, &Naveed, 2017). One goal of the U.S. government\u2019s Healthy People 2020 initiative is to eliminate gender and racedisparities in health care. Their interactive dataset provides an updated snapshot of health disparities:https://www.healthypeople.gov/2020/data-search/health-disparities-data.Stress and the Immune SystemIn a sense, the immune system is the body\u2019s surveillance system. It consists of a variety of structures, cells,and mechanisms that serve to protect the body from invading microorganisms that can harm or damage thebody\u2019s tissues and organs. When the immune system is working as it should, it keeps us healthy and diseasefree by eliminating harmful bacteria, viruses, and other foreign substances that have entered the body (Everly"

For example, sometimes it can go awry bymistaking your body\u2019s own healthy cells for invaders and repeatedly attacking them. When this happens, theperson is said to have an autoimmune disease, which can affect almost any part of the body. How anautoimmune disease affects a person depends on what part of the body is targeted. For instance, rheumatoidarthritis, an autoimmune disease that affects the joints, results in joint pain, stiffness, and loss of function.Systemic lupus erythematosus, an autoimmune disease that affects the skin, can result in rashes and swellingof the skin. Grave\u2019s disease, an autoimmune disease that affects the thyroid gland, can result in fatigue, weightgain, and muscle aches (National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases [NIAMS], 2012).In addition, the immune system may sometimes break down and be unable to do its job. This situation isreferred to as immunosuppression, the decreased effectiveness of the immune system. When peopleexperience immunosuppression, they become susceptible to any number of infections, illness, and diseases.For example, acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) is a serious and lethal disease that is caused byhuman immunodeficiency virus (HIV), which greatly weakens the immune system by infecting and destroyingantibody-producing cells, thus rendering an untreated person vulnerable to any of a number of opportunisticinfections (Powell, 1996).Stressors and Immune FunctionThe question of whether stress and negative emotional states can influence immune function has captivatedresearchers for over three decades, and discoveries made over that time have dramatically changed the face ofhealth psychology (Kiecolt-Glaser, 2009). Psychoneuroimmunology is the field that studies how psychologicalfactors such as stress influence the immune system and immune functioning. The termpsychoneuroimmunology was first coined in 1981, when it appeared as the title of a book that reviewedavailable evidence for associations between the brain, endocrine system, and immune system (Zacharie,2009). To a large extent, this field evolved from the discovery that there is a connection between the centralnervous system and the immune system.Some of the most compelling evidence for a connection between the brain and the immune system comesfrom studies in which researchers demonstrated that immune responses in animals could be classicallyconditioned (Everly & Lating, 2002). For example, Ader and Cohen (1975) paired flavored water (theconditioned stimulus) with the presentation of an immunosuppressive drug (the unconditioned stimulus),causing sickness (an unconditioned response). Not surprisingly, rats exposed to this pairing developed aconditioned aversion to the flavored water. However, the taste of the water itself later producedimmunosuppression (a conditioned response), indicating that the immune system itself had been conditioned.Many subsequent studies over the years have further demonstrated that immune responses can be classicallyconditioned in both animals and humans (Ader & Cohen, 2001). Thus, if classical conditioning can alterimmunity, other psychological factors should be capable of altering it as well.Hundreds of studies involving tens of thousands of participants have tested many kinds of brief and chronicstressors and their effects on the immune system (e.g., public speaking, medical school examinations,unemployment, marital discord, divorce, death of spouse, burnout and job strain, caring for a relative withAlzheimer\u2019s disease, and exposure to the harsh climate of Antarctica). It has been repeatedly demonstratedthat many kinds of stressors are associated with poor or weakened immune functioning (Glaser & Kiecolt-Glaser, 2005; Kiecolt-Glaser, McGuire, Robles, & Glaser, 2002; Segerstrom & Miller, 2004).When evaluating these findings, it is important to remember that there is a tangible physiological connectionbetween the brain and the immune system. For example, the sympathetic nervous system innervates immuneorgans such as the thymus, bone marrow, spleen, and even lymph nodes (Maier, Watkins, & Fleshner, 1994).Also, we noted earlier that stress hormones released during hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis"

One way they do this is by inhibiting the production oflymphocytes, white blood cells that circulate in the body\u2019s fluids that are important in the immune response(Everly & Lating, 2002).Some of the more dramatic examples demonstrating the link between stress and impaired immune functioninvolve studies in which volunteers were exposed to viruses. The rationale behind this research is that becausestress weakens the immune system, people with high stress levels should be more likely to develop an illnesscompared to those under little stress. In one memorable experiment using this method, researchersinterviewed 276 healthy volunteers about recent stressful experiences (Cohen et al., 1998). Following theinterview, these participants were given nasal drops containing the cold virus (in case you are wondering whyanybody would ever want to participate in a study in which they are subjected to such treatment, theparticipants were paid $800 for their trouble). When examined later, participants who reported experiencingchronic stressors for more than one month\u2014especially enduring difficulties involving work orrelationships\u2014were considerably more likely to have developed colds than were participants who reported nochronic stressors (Figure 14.15).FIGURE 14.15 This graph shows the percentages of participants who developed colds (after receiving the coldvirus) after reporting having experienced chronic stressors lasting at least one month, three months, and six months(adapted from Cohen et al., 1998).In another study, older volunteers were given an influenza virus vaccination. Compared to controls, those whowere caring for a spouse with Alzheimer\u2019s disease (and thus were under chronic stress) showed poorerantibody response following the vaccination (Kiecolt-Glaser, Glaser, Gravenstein, Malarkey, & Sheridan, 1996).Other studies have demonstrated that stress slows down wound healing by impairing immune responsesimportant to wound repair (Glaser & Kiecolt-Glaser, 2005). In one study, for example, skin blisters wereinduced on the forearm. Subjects who reported higher levels of stress produced lower levels of immuneproteins necessary for wound healing (Glaser et al., 1999). Stress, then, is not so much the sword that kills theknight, so to speak; rather, it\u2019s the sword that breaks the knight\u2019s shield, and your immune system is thatshield.Stress and Aging: A Tale of TelomeresHave you ever wondered why people who are stressed often seem to have a haggard look about them? Apioneering study from 2004 suggests that the reason is because stress can actually accelerate the cell biology ofaging.Stress, it seems, can shorten telomeres, which are segments of DNA that protect the ends of chromosomes.DIG DEEPER"

In the study, researchers compared telomere lengths inthe white blood cells in mothers of chronically ill children to those of mothers of healthy children (Epel et al.,2004). Mothers of chronically ill children would be expected to experience more stress than would mothers ofhealthy children. The longer a mother had spent caring for her ill child, the shorter her telomeres (the correlationbetween years of caregiving and telomere length was r= -.40). In addition, higher levels of perceived stress werenegatively correlated with telomere size (r= -.31). These researchers also found that the average telomerelength of the most stressed mothers, compared to the least stressed, was similar to what you would find inpeople who were 9\u201317 years older than they were on average.Numerous other studies since have continued to find associations between stress and eroded telomeres(Blackburn & Epel, 2012). Some studies have even demonstrated that stress can begin to erode telomeres inchildhood and perhaps even before children are born. For example, childhood exposure to violence (e.g.,maternal domestic violence, bullying victimization, and physical maltreatment) was found in one study toaccelerate telomere erosion from ages 5 to 10 (Shalev et al., 2013). Another study reported that young adultswhose mothers had experienced severe stress during their pregnancy had shorter telomeres than did thosewhose mothers had stress-free and uneventful pregnancies (Entringer et al., 2011). Further, the corrosive effectsof childhood stress on telomeres can extend into young adulthood. In an investigation of over 4,000 U.K. womenages 41\u201380, adverse experiences during childhood (e.g., physical abuse, being sent away from home, and parentdivorce) were associated with shortened telomere length (Surtees et al., 2010), and telomere size decreased asthe amount of experienced adversity increased (Figure 14.16).FIGURE 14.16 Telomeres are shorter in adults who experienced more trauma as children (adapted fromBlackburn & Epel, 2012).Efforts to dissect the precise cellular and physiological mechanisms linking short telomeres to stress and diseaseare currently underway. For the time being, telomeres provide us with yet another reminder that stress,especially during early life, can be just as harmful to our health as smoking or fast food (Blackburn & Epel, 2012).Cardiovascular DisordersThe cardiovascular system is composed of the heart and blood circulation system. For many years, disordersthat involve the cardiovascular system\u2014known as cardiovascular disorders\u2014have been a major focal point inthe study of psychophysiological disorders because of the cardiovascular system\u2019s centrality in the stressresponse (Everly & Lating, 2002). Heart disease is one such condition. Each year, heart disease causesapproximately one in three deaths in the United States, and it is the leading cause of death in the developedworld (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [CDC], 2011; Shapiro, 2005).The symptoms of heart disease vary somewhat depending on the specific kind of heart disease one has, but"

The pain often feels like the chest is being pressed or squeezed;burning sensations in the chest and shortness of breath are also commonly reported. Such pain anddiscomfort can spread to the arms, neck, jaws, stomach (as nausea), and back (American Heart Association[AHA], 2012a) (Figure 14.17).14.3 \u2022 Stress and Illness 507FIGURE 14.17 Males and females often experience different symptoms of a heart attack.A major risk factor for heart disease is hypertension, which is high blood pressure. Hypertension forces aperson\u2019s heart to pump harder, thus putting more physical strain on the heart. If left unchecked, hypertensioncan lead to a heart attack, stroke, or heart failure; it can also lead to kidney failure and blindness. Hypertensionis a serious cardiovascular disorder, and it is sometimes called the silent killer because it has nosymptoms\u2014one who has high blood pressure may not even be aware of it (AHA, 2012b).Many risk factors contributing to cardiovascular disorders have been identified. These risk factors includesocial determinants such as aging, income, education, and employment status, as well as behavioral riskfactors that include unhealthy diet, tobacco use, physical inactivity, and excessive alcohol consumption;obesity and diabetes are additional risk factors (World Health Organization [WHO], 2013).Over the past few decades, there has been much greater recognition and awareness of the importance of stressand other psychological factors in cardiovascular health (Nusair, Al-dadah, & Kumar, 2012). Indeed, exposureto stressors of many kinds has also been linked to cardiovascular problems; in the case of hypertension, someof these stressors include job strain (Trudel, Brisson, & Milot, 2010), natural disasters (Saito, Kim, Maekawa,Ikeda, & Yokoyama, 1997), marital conflict (Nealey-Moore, Smith, Uchino, Hawkins, & Olson-Cerny, 2007), andexposure to high traffic noise levels at one\u2019s home (de Kluizenaar, Gansevoort, Miedema, & de Jong, 2007).Perceived discrimination appears to be associated with hypertension among African Americans (Sims et al.,2012). In addition, laboratory-based stress tasks, such as performing mental arithmetic under time pressure,immersing one\u2019s hand into ice water (known as the cold pressor test), mirror tracing, and public speaking haveall been shown to elevate blood pressure (Phillips, 2011).Are You Type A or Type B?Sometimes research ideas and theories emerge from seemingly trivial observations.

When the man doing the reupholstering cameto the office to do the work, he commented on how the chairs were worn in a unique manner\u2014the front edgesof the cushions were worn down, as were the front tips of the arm rests. It seemed like the cardiology patientswere tapping or squeezing the front of the armrests, as well as literally sitting on the edge of their seats(Friedman & Rosenman, 1974). Were cardiology patients somehow different than other types of patients? If so,how?After researching this matter, Friedman and his colleague, Ray Rosenman, came to understand that peoplewho are prone to heart disease tend to think, feel, and act differently than those who are not. These individualstend to be intensively driven workaholics who are preoccupied with deadlines and always seem to be in a rush.According to Friedman and Rosenman, these individuals exhibit Type A behavior pattern; those who are morerelaxed and laid-back were characterized as Type B (Figure 14.18). In a sample of Type As and Type Bs,Friedman and Rosenman were startled to discover that heart disease was over seven times more frequentamong the Type As than the Type Bs (Friedman & Rosenman, 1959).FIGURE 14.18 (a) Type A individuals are characterized as intensely driven, (b) while Type B people arecharacterized as laid-back and relaxed. (credit a: modification of work by Greg Hernandez; credit b: modification ofwork by Elvert Barnes)The major components of the Type A pattern include an aggressive and chronic struggle to achieve more andmore in less and less time (Friedman & Rosenman, 1974). Specific characteristics of the Type A patterninclude an excessive competitive drive, chronic sense of time urgency, impatience, and hostility toward others(particularly those who get in the person\u2019s way).An example of a person who exhibits Type A behavior pattern is Jeffrey. Even as a child, Jeffrey was intenseand driven. He excelled at school, was captain of the swim team, and graduated with honors from an IvyLeague college. Jeffrey never seems able to relax; he is always working on something, even on the weekends.However, Jeffrey always seems to feel as though there are not enough hours in the day to accomplish all hefeels he should. He volunteers to take on extra tasks at work and often brings his work home with him; he oftengoes to bed frustrated late at night because he feels that he has not done enough. Jeffrey is quick temperedwith his coworkers; he often becomes noticeably agitated when dealing with those coworkers he feels work tooslowly or whose work does not meet his standards. He typically reacts with hostility when interrupted at work.He has experienced problems in his marriage over his lack of time spent with family. When caught in trafficduring his commute to and from work, Jeffrey incessantly pounds on his horn and swears loudly at otherdrivers. When Jeffrey was 52, he suffered his first heart attack.By the 1970s, a majority of practicing cardiologists believed that Type A behavior pattern was a significant riskfactor for heart disease (Friedman, 1977). Indeed, a number of early longitudinal investigations demonstrateda link between Type A behavior pattern and later development of heart disease (Rosenman et al., 1975;Haynes, Feinleib, & Kannel, 1980).Subsequent research examining the association between Type A and heart disease, however, failed to replicatethese earlier findings (Glassman, 2007; Myrtek, 2001). Because Type A theory did not pan out as well as theyhad hoped, researchers shifted their attention toward determining if any of the specific elements of Type A"

This relationship was initially described inthe Haynes et al. (1980) study mentioned above: Suppressed hostility was found to substantially elevate therisk of heart disease for both men and women. Also, one investigation followed over 1,000 male medicalstudents from 32 to 48 years. At the beginning of the study, these men completed a questionnaire assessinghow they react to pressure; some indicated that they respond with high levels of anger, whereas othersindicated that they respond with less anger. Decades later, researchers found that those who earlier hadindicated the highest levels of anger were over 6 times more likely than those who indicated less anger to havehad a heart attack by age 55, and they were 3.5 times more likely to have experienced heart disease by thesame age (Chang, Ford, Meoni, Wang, & Klag, 2002). From a health standpoint, it clearly does not pay to be anangry person.After reviewing and statistically summarizing 35 studies from 1983 to 2006, Chida and Steptoe (2009)concluded that the bulk of the evidence suggests that anger and hostility constitute serious long-term riskfactors for adverse cardiovascular outcomes among both healthy individuals and those already suffering fromheart disease. One reason angry and hostile moods might contribute to cardiovascular diseases is that suchmoods can create social strain, mainly in the form of antagonistic social encounters with others. This straincould then lay the foundation for disease-promoting cardiovascular responses among hostile individuals(Vella, Kamarck, Flory, & Manuck, 2012). In this transactional model, hostility and social strain form a cycle(Figure 14.19).FIGURE 14.19 According to the transactional model of hostility for predicting social interactions (Vella et al., 2012),the thoughts and feelings of a hostile person promote antagonistic behavior toward others, which in turn reinforcescomplimentary reactions from others, thereby intensifying ones\u2019 hostile disposition and intensifying the cyclicalnature of this relationship.For example, suppose Kaitlin has a hostile disposition; she has a cynical, distrustful attitude toward others and"

She is very defensive around people, even those she hasknown for years, and she is always looking for signs that others are either disrespecting or belittling her. In theshower each morning before work, she often mentally rehearses what she would say to someone who said ordid something that angered her, such as making a political statement that was counter to her own ideology. AsKaitlin goes through these mental rehearsals, she often grins and thinks about the retaliation on anyone whowill irk her that day.Socially, she is confrontational and tends to use a harsh tone with people, which often leads to verydisagreeable and sometimes argumentative social interactions. As you might imagine, Kaitlin is not especiallypopular with others, including coworkers, neighbors, and even members of her own family. They either avoidher at all costs or snap back at her, which causes Kaitlin to become even more cynical and distrustful of others,making her disposition even more hostile. Kaitlin\u2019s hostility\u2014through her own doing\u2014has created anantagonistic environment that cyclically causes her to become even more hostile and angry, therebypotentially setting the stage for cardiovascular problems.In addition to anger and hostility, a number of other negative emotional states have been linked with heartdisease, including negative affectivity and depression (Suls & Bunde, 2005). Negative affectivity is a tendencyto experience distressed emotional states involving anger, contempt, disgust, guilt, fear, and nervousness(Watson, Clark, & Tellegen, 1988). It has been linked with the development of both hypertension and heartdisease. For example, over 3,000 initially healthy participants in one study were tracked longitudinally, up to22 years. Those with higher levels of negative affectivity at the time the study began were substantially morelikely to develop and be treated for hypertension during the ensuing years than were those with lower levels ofnegative affectivity (Jonas & Lando, 2000). In addition, a study of over 10,000 middle-aged London-based civilservants who were followed an average of 12.5 years revealed that those who earlier had scored in the upperthird on a test of negative affectivity were 32% more likely to have experienced heart disease, heart attack, orangina over a period of years than were those who scored in the lowest third (Nabi, Kivimaki, De Vogli, Marmot,& Singh-Manoux, 2008). Hence, negative affectivity appears to be a potentially vital risk factor for thedevelopment of cardiovascular disorders.Depression and the HeartFor centuries, poets and folklore have asserted that there is a connection between moods and the heart(Glassman & Shapiro, 1998). You are no doubt familiar with the notion of a broken heart following adisappointing or depressing event and have encountered that notion in songs, films, and literature.Perhaps the first to recognize the link between depression and heart disease was Benjamin Malzberg (1937),who found that the death rate among institutionalized patients with melancholia (an archaic term fordepression) was six times higher than that of the population. A classic study in the late 1970s looked at over8,000 people diagnosed with manic-depressive disorder (now classified as bipolar disorder) in Denmark,finding a nearly 50% increase in deaths from heart disease among these patients compared with the generalDanish population (Weeke, 1979). By the early 1990s, evidence began to accumulate showing that depressedindividuals who were followed for long periods of time were at increased risk for heart disease and cardiacdeath (Glassman, 2007). In one investigation of over 700 Denmark residents, those with the highest depressionscores were 71% more likely to have experienced a heart attack than were those with lower depression scores(Barefoot & Schroll, 1996). Figure 14.20 illustrates the gradation in risk of heart attacks for both men andwomen."

Recently, they have recommended including depression as a risk factor for heartdisease patients (AHA, 2014).Although the exact mechanisms through which depression might produce heart problems have not been fullyclarified, a recent investigation examining this connection in early life has shed some light. In an ongoingstudy of childhood depression, adolescents who had been diagnosed with depression as children were morelikely to be obese, smoke, and be physically inactive than were those who had not received this diagnosis(Rottenberg et al., 2014). One implication of this study is that depression, especially if it occurs early in life,may increase the likelihood of living an unhealthy lifestyle, thereby predisposing people to an unfavorablecardiovascular disease risk profile.It is important to point out that depression may be just one piece of the emotional puzzle in elevating the riskfor heart disease, and that chronically experiencing several negative emotional states may be especiallyimportant. A longitudinal investigation of Vietnam War veterans found that depression, anxiety, hostility, andtrait anger each independently predicted the onset of heart disease (Boyle, Michalek, & Suarez, 2006).However, when each of these negative psychological attributes was combined into a single variable, this newvariable (which researchers called psychological risk factor) predicted heart disease more strongly than any ofthe individual variables. Thus, rather than examining the predictive power of isolated psychological riskfactors, it seems crucial for future researchers to examine the effects of combined and more general negative"

The airway obstruction is caused by inflammation of theairways (leading to thickening of the airway walls) and a tightening of the muscles around them, resulting in anarrowing of the airways (Figure 14.21) (American Lung Association, 2010). Because airways becomeobstructed, a person with asthma will sometimes have great difficulty breathing and will experience repeatedepisodes of wheezing, chest tightness, shortness of breath, and coughing, the latter occurring mostly duringthe morning and night (CDC, 2006).FIGURE 14.21 In asthma, the airways become inflamed and narrowed.According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), around 4,000 people die each year fromasthma-related causes, and asthma is a contributing factor to another 7,000 deaths each year (CDC, 2013a).The CDC has revealed that asthma affects 18.7 million U.S. adults and is more common among people withlower income levels (CDC, 2013b). Especially concerning is that asthma is on the rise, with rates of asthmaincreasing 157% between 2000 and 2010 (CDC, 2013b).Asthma attacks are acute episodes in which an asthma sufferer experiences the full range of symptoms.Asthma exacerbation is often triggered by environmental factors, such as air pollution, allergens (e.g., pollen,mold, and pet hairs), cigarette smoke, airway infections, cold air or a sudden change in temperature, andexercise (CDC, 2013b). Certain regions and neighborhoods are known for having notably high rates of asthmaand related diseases due to high rates of concentrated pollution and low air quality. For example, Long Beach,California and Bronx, New York contain \"asthma alleys\" due to the density of trucking, power plants, factories,sewage works, or other agents of air pollution.Psychological factors appear to play an important role in asthma (Wright, Rodriguez, & Cohen, 1998), althoughsome believe that psychological factors serve as potential triggers in only a subset of asthma patients (Ritz,Steptoe, Bobb, Harris, & Edwards, 2006). Many studies over the years have demonstrated that some people"

As stress and emotions directly affect immune and respiratory functions, psychological factors likelyserve as one of the most common triggers of asthma exacerbation (Trueba & Ritz, 2013).People with asthma tend to report and display a high level of negative emotions such as anxiety, and asthmaattacks have been linked to periods of high emotionality (Lehrer, Isenberg, & Hochron, 1993). In addition, highlevels of emotional distress during both laboratory tasks and daily life have been found to negatively affectairway function and can produce asthma-like symptoms in people with asthma (von Leupoldt, Ehnes, &Dahme, 2006). In one investigation, 20 adults with asthma wore preprogrammed wristwatches that signaledthem to breathe into a portable device that measures airway function. Results showed that higher levels ofnegative emotions and stress were associated with increased airway obstruction and self-reported asthmasymptoms (Smyth, Soefer, Hurewitz, Kliment, & Stone, 1999). In addition, D\u2019Amato, Liccardi, Cecchi,Pellegrino, & D\u2019Amato (2010) described a case study of an 18-year-old man with asthma whose girlfriend hadbroken up with him, leaving him in a depressed state. She had also unfriended him on Facebook, whilefriending other young males. Eventually, the young man was able to \u201cfriend\u201d her once again and could monitorher activity through Facebook. Subsequently, he would experience asthma symptoms whenever he logged onand accessed her profile. When he later resigned not to use Facebook any longer, the asthma attacks stopped.This case suggests that the use of Facebook and other forms of social media may represent a new source ofstress\u2014it may be a triggering factor for asthma attacks, especially in depressed asthmatic individuals.Exposure to stressful experiences, particularly those that involve parental or interpersonal conflicts, has beenlinked to the development of asthma throughout the lifespan. A longitudinal study of 145 children found thatparenting difficulties during the first year of life increased the chances that the child developed asthma by107% (Klinnert et al., 2001). In addition, a cross-sectional study of over 10,000 Finnish college students foundthat high rates of parent or personal conflicts (e.g., parental divorce, separation from spouse, or severeconflicts in other long-term relationships) increased the risk of asthma onset (Kilpel\u00e4inen, Koskenvuo,Helenius, & Terho, 2002). Further, a study of over 4,000 middle-aged men who were interviewed in the early1990s and again a decade later found that breaking off an important life partnership (e.g., divorce or breakingoff relationship from parents) increased the risk of developing asthma by 124% over the time of the study(Loerbroks, Apfelbacher, Thayer, Debling, & St\u00fcrmer, 2009).HeadachesA headache is a continuous pain anywhere in the head and neck region. Inflammation of the sinuses caused byan infection or allergic reaction can cause sinus headaches, which are experienced as pain in the cheeks andforehead. Migraine headaches are a type of headache thought to be caused by blood vessel swelling andincreased blood flow (McIntosh, 2013). Migraines are characterized by severe pain on one or both sides of thehead, an upset stomach, and disturbed vision. They are more frequently experienced by women than by men(American Academy of Neurology, 2014). Tension headaches are triggered by tightening/tensing of facial andneck muscles; they are the most commonly experienced kind of headache, accounting for about 42% of allheadaches worldwide (Stovner et al., 2007). In the United States, well over one-third of the populationexperiences tension headaches each year, and 2\u20133% of the population suffers from chronic tension headaches(Schwartz, Stewart, Simon, & Lipton, 1998).A number of factors can contribute to tension headaches, including sleep deprivation, skipping meals, eyestrain, overexertion, muscular tension caused by poor posture, and stress (MedicineNet, 2013). Although thereis uncertainty regarding the exact mechanisms through which stress can produce tension headaches, stresshas been demonstrated to increase sensitivity to pain (Caceres & Burns, 1997; Logan et al., 2001). In general,tension headache sufferers, compared to non-sufferers, have a lower threshold for and greater sensitivity topain (Ukestad & Wittrock, 1996), and they report greater levels of subjective stress when faced with a stressor(Myers, Wittrock, & Foreman, 1998). Thus, stress may contribute to tension headaches by increasing pain"

When we experience events in our lives that we appraise as stressful,it is essential that we use effective coping strategies to manage our stress. Coping refers to mental andbehavioral efforts that we use to deal with problems relating to stress.Coping StylesLazarus and Folkman (1984) distinguished two fundamental kinds of coping: problem-focused coping andemotion-focused coping. In problem-focused coping, one attempts to manage or alter the problem that iscausing one to experience stress (i.e., the stressor). Problem-focused coping strategies are similar to strategiesused in everyday problem-solving: they typically involve identifying the problem, considering possiblesolutions, weighing the costs and benefits of these solutions, and then selecting an alternative (Lazarus &Folkman, 1984). As an example, suppose Bradford receives a midterm notice that he is failing statistics class. IfBradford adopts a problem-focused coping approach to managing his stress, he would be proactive in trying toalleviate the source of the stress. He might contact his professor to discuss what must be done to raise hisgrade, he might also decide to set aside two hours daily to study statistics assignments, and he may seektutoring assistance. A problem-focused approach to managing stress means we actively try to do things toaddress the problem.Emotion-focused coping, in contrast, consists of efforts to change or reduce the negative emotions associatedwith stress. These efforts may include avoiding, minimizing, or distancing oneself from the problem, orpositive comparisons with others (\u201cI\u2019m not as bad off as she is\u201d), or seeking something positive in a negativeevent (\u201cNow that I\u2019ve been fired, I can sleep in for a few days\u201d). In some cases, emotion-focused copingstrategies involve reappraisal, whereby the stressor is construed differently (and somewhat self-deceptively)without changing its objective level of threat (Lazarus & Folkman, 1984). For example, a person sentenced tofederal prison who thinks, \u201cThis will give me a great chance to network with others,\u201d is using reappraisal. IfBradford adopted an emotion-focused approach to managing his midterm deficiency stress, he might watch acomedy movie, play video games, or spend hours on social media to take his mind off the situation. In a certainsense, emotion-focused coping can be thought of as treating the symptoms rather than the actual cause.While many stressors elicit both kinds of coping strategies, problem-focused coping is more likely to occurwhen encountering stressors we perceive as controllable, while emotion-focused coping is more likely topredominate when faced with stressors that we believe we are powerless to change (Folkman & Lazarus, 1980).Clearly, emotion-focused coping is more effective in dealing with uncontrollable stressors. For example, thestress you experience when a loved one dies can be overwhelming. You are simply powerless to change thesituation as there is nothing you can do to bring this person back. The most helpful coping response isemotion-focused coping aimed at minimizing the pain of the grieving period.Fortunately, most stressors we encounter can be modified and are, to varying degrees, controllable. A personwho cannot stand her job can quit and look for work elsewhere; a middle-aged divorcee can find anotherpotential partner; the freshman who fails an exam can study harder next time, and a breast lump does notnecessarily mean that one is fated to die of breast cancer."

Albert Bandura (1997) stated that \u201ctheintensity and chronicity of human stress is governed largely by perceived control over the demands of one\u2019slife\u201d (p. 262). As cogently described in his statement, our reaction to potential stressors depends to a largeextent on how much control we feel we have over such things. Perceived control is our beliefs about ourpersonal capacity to exert influence over and shape outcomes, and it has major implications for our health andhappiness (Infurna & Gerstorf, 2014). Extensive research has demonstrated that perceptions of personalcontrol are associated with a variety of favorable outcomes, such as better physical and mental health andgreater psychological well-being (Diehl & Hay, 2010). Greater personal control is also associated with lowerreactivity to stressors in daily life. For example, researchers in one investigation found that higher levels ofperceived control at one point in time were later associated with lower emotional and physical reactivity tointerpersonal stressors (Neupert, Almeida, & Charles, 2007). Further, a daily diary study with 34 older widowsfound that their stress and anxiety levels were significantly reduced on days during which the widows feltgreater perceived control (Ong, Bergeman, & Bisconti, 2005).DIG DEEPERLearned HelplessnessWhen we lack a sense of control over the events in our lives, particularly when those events are threatening,harmful, or noxious, the psychological consequences can be profound. In one of the better illustrations of thisconcept, psychologist Martin Seligman conducted a series of classic experiments in the 1960s (Seligman &Maier, 1967) in which dogs were placed in a chamber where they received electric shocks from which they couldnot escape. Later, when these dogs were given the opportunity to escape the shocks by jumping across apartition, most failed to even try; they seemed to just give up and passively accept any shocks the experimenterschose to administer. In comparison, dogs who were previously allowed to escape the shocks tended to jump thepartition and escape the pain (Figure 14.22).FIGURE 14.22 Seligman\u2019s learned helplessness experiments with dogs used an apparatus that measured whenthe animals would move from a floor delivering shocks to one without.Seligman believed that the dogs who failed to try to escape the later shocks were demonstrating learned"

Seligman also believed that the passivity and lack of initiative these dogs demonstrated wassimilar to that observed in human depression. Therefore, Seligman speculated that learned helplessness mightbe an important cause of depression in humans: Humans who experience negative life events that they believethey are unable to control may become helpless. As a result, they give up trying to change the situation and somemay become depressed and show lack of initiative in future situations in which they can control the outcomes(Seligman, Maier, & Geer, 1968). In an application Seligman never proposed, learned helplessness was later usedas a methodology in the torture of prisoners by U.S. military and intelligence personnel following the 2001attacks on the World Trade Center. The psychologists who designed the torture program, James E. Mitchell andBruce Jesson, theorized that detainees who were subjected to uncontrollable afflictions would eventuallybecome passive and compliant, making them more likely to reveal information to their interrogators. There islittle evidence that the program achieved worthwhile results. It is now widely regarded as unethical andunjustified. This example emphasizes the need to consistently consider the ethics of research studies and theirapplications (Konnikova, 2015).Seligman and colleagues later reformulated the original learned helplessness model of depression (Abramson,Seligman, & Teasdale, 1978). In their reformulation, they emphasized attributions (i.e., a mental explanation forwhy something occurred) that fostered a sense of learned helplessness. For example, suppose a coworker showsup late to work; your belief as to what caused the coworker\u2019s tardiness would be an attribution (e.g., too muchtraffic, slept too late, or just doesn\u2019t care about being on time).The reformulated version of Seligman\u2019s study holds that the attributions made for negative life events contributeto depression. Consider the example of a student who performs poorly on a midterm exam. This model suggeststhat the student will make three kinds of attributions for this outcome: internal vs. external (believing theoutcome was caused by his own personal inadequacies or by environmental factors), stable vs. unstable(believing the cause can be changed or is permanent), and global vs. specific (believing the outcome is a sign ofinadequacy in most everything versus just this area). Assume that the student makes an internal (\u201cI\u2019m just notsmart\u201d), stable (\u201cNothing can be done to change the fact that I\u2019m not smart\u201d) and global (\u201cThis is anotherexample of how lousy I am at everything\u201d) attribution for the poor performance. The reformulated theorypredicts that the student would perceive a lack of control over this stressful event and thus be especially proneto developing depression. Indeed, research has demonstrated that people who have a tendency to makeinternal, global, and stable attributions for bad outcomes tend to develop symptoms of depression when facedwith negative life experiences (Peterson & Seligman, 1984). Fortunately, attribution habits can be changedthrough practice. Training in healthy attribution habits has been shown to make people less vulnerable todepression (Konnikova, 2015).Seligman\u2019s learned helplessness model has emerged over the years as a leading theoretical explanation for theonset of major depressive disorder. When you study psychological disorders, you will learn more about the latestreformulation of this model\u2014now called hopelessness theory.People who report higher levels of perceived control view their health as controllable, thereby making it morelikely that they will better manage their health and engage in behaviors conducive to good health (Bandura,2004). Not surprisingly, greater perceived control has been linked to lower risk of physical health problems,including declines in physical functioning (Infurna, Gerstorf, Ram, Schupp, & Wagner, 2011), heart attacks(Rosengren et al., 2004), and both cardiovascular disease incidence (St\u00fcrmer, Hasselbach, & Amelang, 2006)and mortality from cardiac disease (Surtees et al., 2010). In addition, longitudinal studies of British civilservants have found that those in low-status jobs (e.g., clerical and office support staff) in which the degree ofcontrol over the job is minimal are considerably more likely to develop heart disease than those with high-status jobs or considerable control over their jobs (Marmot, Bosma, Hemingway, & Stansfeld, 1997)."

In general, research has found that more affluent individuals experience better health partly becausethey tend to believe that they can personally control and manage their reactions to life\u2019s stressors (Johnson &Krueger, 2006). Perhaps buoyed by the perceived level of control, individuals of higher social class may beprone to overestimating the degree of influence they have over particular outcomes. For example, those ofhigher social class tend to believe that their votes have greater sway on election outcomes than do those oflower social class, which may explain higher rates of voting in more affluent communities (Krosnick, 1990).Other research has found that a sense of perceived control can protect less affluent individuals from poorerhealth, depression, and reduced life-satisfaction\u2014all of which tend to accompany lower social standing(Lachman & Weaver, 1998).Taken together, findings from these and many other studies clearly suggest that perceptions of control andcoping abilities are important in managing and coping with the stressors we encounter throughout life.Social SupportThe need to form and maintain strong, stable relationships with others is a powerful, pervasive, andfundamental human motive (Baumeister & Leary, 1995). Building strong interpersonal relationships withothers helps us establish a network of close, caring individuals who can provide social support in times ofdistress, sorrow, and fear. Social support can be thought of as the soothing impact of friends, family, andacquaintances (Baron & Kerr, 2003). Social support can take many forms, including advice, guidance,encouragement, acceptance, emotional comfort, and tangible assistance (such as financial help). Thus, otherpeople can be very comforting to us when we are faced with a wide range of life stressors, and they can beextremely helpful in our efforts to manage these challenges. Even in nonhuman animals, species mates canoffer social support during times of stress. For example, elephants seem to be able to sense when otherelephants are stressed and will often comfort them with physical contact\u2014such as a trunk touch\u2014or anempathetic vocal response (Krumboltz, 2014).Scientific interest in the importance of social support first emerged in the 1970s when health researchersdeveloped an interest in the health consequences of being socially integrated (Stroebe & Stroebe, 1996).Interest was further fueled by longitudinal studies showing that social connectedness reduced mortality. Inone classic study, nearly 7,000 Alameda County, California, residents were followed over 9 years. Those whohad previously indicated that they lacked social and community ties were more likely to die during the follow-up period than those with more extensive social networks. Compared to those with the most social contacts,isolated men and women were, respectively, 2.3 and 2.8 times more likely to die. These trends persisted evenafter controlling for a variety of health-related variables, such as smoking, alcohol consumption, self-reportedhealth at the beginning of the study, and physical activity (Berkman & Syme, 1979).Since the time of that study, social support has emerged as one of the well-documented psychosocial factorsaffecting health outcomes (Uchino, 2009). A statistical review of 148 studies conducted between 1982 and2007 involving over 300,000 participants concluded that individuals with stronger social relationships have a50% greater likelihood of survival compared to those with weak or insufficient social relationships (Holt-Lunstad, Smith, & Layton, 2010). According to the researchers, the magnitude of the effect of social supportobserved in this study is comparable with quitting smoking and exceeded many well-known risk factors formortality, such as obesity and physical inactivity (Figure 14.23)."

(credit a: modification of work by \"DamianGadal_Flickr\"/Flickr; credit b: modification of work by Christian Haugen)A number of large-scale studies have found that individuals with low levels of social support are at greater riskof mortality, especially from cardiovascular disorders (Brummett et al., 2001). Further, higher levels of socialsupported have been linked to better survival rates following breast cancer (Falagas et al., 2007) and infectiousdiseases, especially HIV infection (Lee & Rotheram-Borus, 2001). In fact, a person with high levels of socialsupport is less likely to contract a common cold. In one study, 334 participants completed questionnairesassessing their sociability; these individuals were subsequently exposed to a virus that causes a common coldand monitored for several weeks to see who became ill. Results showed that increased sociability was linearlyassociated with a decreased probability of developing a cold (Cohen, Doyle, Turner, Alper, & Skoner, 2003).For many of us, friends are a vital source of social support. But what if you find yourself in a situation in whichyou have few friends and companions? Many students who leave home to attend and live at college experiencedrastic reductions in their social support, which makes them vulnerable to anxiety, depression, and loneliness.Social media can sometimes be useful in navigating these transitions (Raney & Troop Gordon, 2012) but mightalso cause increases in loneliness (Hunt, Marx, Lipson, & Young, 2018). For this reason, many colleges havedesigned first-year programs, such as peer mentoring (Raymond & Shepard, 2018), that can help studentsbuild new social networks. For some people, our families\u2014especially our parents\u2014are a major source of socialsupport.Social support appears to work by boosting the immune system, especially among people who areexperiencing stress (Uchino, Vaughn, Carlisle, & Birmingham, 2012). In a pioneering study, spouses of cancerpatients who reported high levels of social support showed indications of better immune functioning on twoout of three immune functioning measures, compared to spouses who were below the median on reportedsocial support (Baron, Cutrona, Hicklin, Russell, & Lubaroff, 1990). Studies of other populations have producedsimilar results, including those of spousal caregivers of dementia sufferers, medical students, elderly adults,and cancer patients (Cohen & Herbert, 1996; Kiecolt-Glaser, McGuire, Robles, & Glaser, 2002).In addition, social support has been shown to reduce blood pressure for people performing stressful tasks,such as giving a speech or performing mental arithmetic (Lepore, 1998). In these kinds of studies, participantsare usually asked to perform a stressful task either alone, with a stranger present (who may be eithersupportive or unsupportive), or with a friend present. Those tested with a friend present generally exhibitlower blood pressure than those tested alone or with a stranger (Fontana, Diegnan, Villeneuve, & Lepore,1999). In one study, 112 female participants who performed stressful mental arithmetic exhibited lower bloodpressure when they received support from a friend rather than a stranger, but only if the friend was a male(Phillips, Gallagher, & Carroll, 2009). Although these findings are somewhat difficult to interpret, the authorsmention that it is possible that females feel less supported and more evaluated by other females, particularlyfemales whose opinions they value.Taken together, the findings above suggest one of the reasons social support is connected to favorable healthoutcomes is because it has several beneficial physiological effects in stressful situations. However, it is alsoimportant to consider the possibility that social support may lead to better health behaviors, such as a healthy"

Manystudies have shown how discrimination is a significant stressor for marginalized groups (Pascoe & SmartRichman, 2009). Discrimination negatively impacts both physical and mental health for individuals in stigmatizedgroups. As you\u2019ll learn when you study social psychology, various social identities (such as gender, age, religion,sexuality, ethnicity) often lead people to simultaneously be exposed to multiple forms of discrimination, whichcan have even stronger negative effects on mental and physical health (Vines, Ward, Cordoba, & Black, 2017).For example, the amplified levels of discrimination faced by Latinx transgender women may have related effects,leading to high stress levels and poor mental and physical health outcomes.Perceived control and the general adaptation syndrome help explain the process by which discrimination affectsmental and physical health. Discrimination can be conceptualized as an uncontrollable, persistent, andunpredictable stressor. When a discriminatory event occurs, the target of the event initially experiences an acutestress response (alarm stage). This acute reaction alone does not typically have a great impact on health.However, discrimination tends to be a chronic stressor. As people in marginalized groups experience repeateddiscrimination, they develop a heightened reactivity as their bodies prepare to act quickly (resistance stage). Thislong-term accumulation of stress responses can eventually lead to increases in negative emotion and wear onphysical health (exhaustion stage). This explains why a history of perceived discrimination is associated with ahost of mental and physical health problems including depression, cardiovascular disease, and cancer (Pascoe &Smart Richman, 2009).Protecting stigmatized groups from the negative impact of discrimination-induced stress may involve reducingthe incidence of discriminatory behaviors in conjunction with protective strategies that reduce the impact ofdiscriminatory events when they occur. Civil rights legislation has protected some stigmatized groups by makingdiscrimination a prosecutable offense in many social contexts. However, some groups (e.g., transgender people)often lack important legal recourse when discrimination occurs. Moreover, most modern discrimination comes insubtle forms that fall below the radar of the law. For example, discrimination may be experienced as selectiveinhospitality toward people of specific races or ethnicities, but little is done in response since it would be easy toattribute the behavior to other causes. Although some cultural changes are increasingly helping people torecognize and control subtle discrimination, such shifts may take a long time.Similar to other stressors, buffers like social support and healthy coping strategies appear to be effective inlowering the impact of perceived discrimination. For example, one study (Ajrouch, Reisine, Lim, Sohn, & Ismail,2010) showed that discrimination predicted high psychological distress among African American mothers livingin Detroit. However, the women who had readily available emotional support from friends and family experiencedless distress than those with fewer social resources. While coping strategies and social support may buffer theeffects of discrimination, they fail to erase all of the negative impacts. Vigilant antidiscrimination efforts,including the development of legal protections for vulnerable groups, are needed to reduce discrimination,stress, and the resulting physical and mental health effects.Stress Reduction TechniquesBeyond having a sense of control and establishing social support networks, there are numerous other meansby which we can manage stress (Figure 14.24). A common technique people use to combat stress is exercise(Salmon, 2001). It is well-established that exercise, both of long (aerobic) and short (anaerobic) duration, isbeneficial for both physical and mental health (Everly & Lating, 2002). There is considerable evidence thatphysically fit individuals are more resistant to the adverse effects of stress and recover more quickly from"

In a study of more than 500 Swiss police officers andemergency service personnel, increased physical fitness was associated with reduced stress, and regularexercise was reported to protect against stress-related health problems (Gerber, Kellman, Hartman, & P\u00fchse,2010).FIGURE 14.24 Stress reduction techniques may include (a) exercise, (b) meditation and relaxation, or (c)biofeedback. (credit a: modification of work by \u201cUNE Photos\u201d/Flickr; credit b: modification of work by Caleb Roenigk;credit c: modification of work by Dr. Carmen Russoniello)One reason exercise may be beneficial is because it might buffer some of the deleterious physiologicalmechanisms of stress. One study found rats that exercised for six weeks showed a decrease in hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal responsiveness to mild stressors (Campeau et al., 2010). In high-stress humans, exercise hasbeen shown to prevent telomere shortening, which may explain the common observation of a youthfulappearance among those who exercise regularly (Puterman et al., 2010). Further, exercise in later adulthoodappears to minimize the detrimental effects of stress on the hippocampus and memory (Head, Singh, & Bugg,2012). Among cancer survivors, exercise has been shown to reduce anxiety (Speck, Courneya, Masse, Duval, &Schmitz, 2010) and depressive symptoms (Craft, VanIterson, Helenowski, Rademaker, & Courneya, 2012).Clearly, exercise is a highly effective tool for regulating stress.In the 1970s, Herbert Benson, a cardiologist, developed a stress reduction method called the relaxationresponse technique (Greenberg, 2006). The relaxation response technique combines relaxation withtranscendental meditation, and consists of four components (Stein, 2001):1. sitting upright on a comfortable chair with feet on the ground and body in a relaxed position,2. being in a quiet environment with eyes closed,3.4. passively allowing the mind to focus on pleasant thoughts, such as nature or the warmth of your bloodrepeating a word or a phrase\u2014a mantra\u2014to oneself, such as \u201calert mind, calm body,\u201dnourishing your body.The relaxation response approach is conceptualized as a general approach to stress reduction that reducessympathetic arousal, and it has been used effectively to treat people with high blood pressure (Benson &Proctor, 1994).Another technique to combat stress, biofeedback, was developed by Gary Schwartz at Harvard University inthe early 1970s. Biofeedback is a technique that uses electronic equipment to accurately measure a person\u2019sneuromuscular and autonomic activity\u2014feedback is provided in the form of visual or auditory signals. Themain assumption of this approach is that providing somebody biofeedback will enable the individual todevelop strategies that help gain some level of voluntary control over what are normally involuntary bodilyprocesses (Schwartz & Schwartz, 1995). A number of different bodily measures have been used in biofeedbackresearch, including facial muscle movement, brain activity, and skin temperature, and it has been appliedsuccessfully with individuals experiencing tension headaches, high blood pressure, asthma, and phobias(Stein, 2001)."

Psychology is also interested in the study of a more upbeat andencouraging approach to human affairs\u2014the quest for happiness.HappinessAmerica\u2019s founders declared that its citizens have an unalienable right to pursue happiness. But what ishappiness? When asked to define the term, people emphasize different aspects of this elusive state. Indeed,happiness is somewhat ambiguous and can be defined from different perspectives (Martin, 2012). Somepeople, especially those who are highly committed to their religious faith, view happiness in ways thatemphasize virtuosity, reverence, and enlightened spirituality. Others see happiness as primarilycontentment\u2014the inner peace and joy that come from deep satisfaction with one\u2019s surroundings, relationshipswith others, accomplishments, and oneself. Still others view happiness mainly as pleasurable engagementwith their personal environment\u2014having a career and hobbies that are engaging, meaningful, rewarding, andexciting. These differences, of course, are merely differences in emphasis. Most people would probably agreethat each of these views, in some respects, captures the essence of happiness.Elements of HappinessSome psychologists have suggested that happiness consists of three distinct elements: the pleasant life, thegood life, and the meaningful life, as shown in Figure 14.25 (Seligman, 2002; Seligman, Steen, Park, &Peterson, 2005). The pleasant life is realized through the attainment of day-to-day pleasures that add fun, joy,and excitement to our lives. For example, evening walks along the beach and a fulfilling sex life can enhanceour daily pleasure and contribute to the pleasant life. The good life is achieved through identifying our uniqueskills and abilities and engaging these talents to enrich our lives; those who achieve the good life often findthemselves absorbed in their work or their recreational pursuits. The meaningful life involves a deep sense offulfillment that comes from using our talents in the service of the greater good: in ways that benefit the lives ofothers or that make the world a better place. In general, the happiest people tend to be those who pursue thefull life\u2014they orient their pursuits toward all three elements (Seligman et al., 2005)."

The definition implies that happiness is a long-termstate\u2014what is often characterized as subjective well-being\u2014rather than merely a transient positive mood we allexperience from time to time. It is this enduring happiness that has captured the interests of psychologists andother social scientists.The study of happiness has grown dramatically in the last three decades (Diener, 2013). One of the most basicquestions that happiness investigators routinely examine is this: How happy are people in general? Theaverage person in the world tends to be relatively happy and tends to indicate experiencing more positivefeelings than negative feelings (Diener, Ng, Harter, & Arora, 2010). When asked to evaluate their current liveson a scale ranging from 0 to 10 (with 0 representing \u201cworst possible life\u201d and 10 representing \u201cbest possiblelife\u201d), people in more than 150 countries surveyed from 2010\u20132012 reported an average score of 5.2. Peoplewho live in North America, Australia, and New Zealand reported the highest average score at 7.1, whereasthose living Sub-Saharan Africa reported the lowest average score at 4.6 (Helliwell, Layard, & Sachs, 2013).Worldwide, the five happiest countries are Denmark, Norway, Switzerland, the Netherlands, and Sweden; theUnited States is ranked 17th happiest (Figure 14.26) (Helliwell et al., 2013).FIGURE 14.26 (a) Surveys of residents in over 150 countries indicate that Denmark has the happiest citizens in theworld.

These results suggest thatchallenging economic conditions may be related to declines in happiness. Of course, this interpretationimplies that happiness is closely tied to one's finances. But, is it? What factors influence happiness?Factors Connected to HappinessWhat really makes people happy? What factors contribute to sustained joy and contentment? Is it money,attractiveness, material possessions, a rewarding occupation, a satisfying relationship? Extensive researchover the years has examined this question. One finding is that age is related to happiness: Life satisfactionusually increases the older people get, but there do not appear to be gender differences in happiness (Diener,Suh, Lucas, & Smith, 1999). Although it is important to point out that much of this work has been correlational,many of the key findings (some of which may surprise you) are summarized below.Family and other social relationships appear to be key factors correlated with happiness. Studies show thatmarried people report being happier than those who are single, divorced, or widowed (Diener et al., 1999).Happy individuals also report that their marriages are fulfilling (Lyubomirsky, King, & Diener, 2005). In fact,some have suggested that satisfaction with marriage and family life is the strongest predictor of happiness(Myers, 2000). Happy people tend to have more friends, more high-quality social relationships, and strongersocial support networks than less happy people (Lyubomirsky et al., 2005). Happy people also have a highfrequency of contact with friends (Pinquart & S\u00f6rensen, 2000).Can money buy happiness? In general, extensive research suggests that the answer is yes, but with severalcaveats. While a nation\u2019s per capita gross domestic product (GDP) is associated with happiness levels (Helliwellet al., 2013), changes in GDP (which is a less certain index of household income) bear little relationship tochanges in happiness (Diener, Tay, & Oishi, 2013). On the whole, residents of affluent countries tend to behappier than residents of poor countries; within countries, wealthy individuals are happier than poorindividuals, but the association is much weaker (Diener & Biswas-Diener, 2002). To the extent that it leads toincreases in purchasing power, increases in income are associated with increases in happiness (Diener, Oishi,& Ryan, 2013). However, income within societies appears to correlate with happiness only up to a point. In astudy of over 450,000 U.S. residents surveyed by the Gallup Organization, Kahneman and Deaton (2010) foundthat well-being rises with annual income, but only up to $75,000. The average increase in reported well-beingfor people with incomes greater than $75,000 was null. As implausible as these findings might seem\u2014after all,higher incomes would enable people to indulge in Hawaiian vacations, prime seats as sporting events,expensive automobiles, and expansive new homes\u2014higher incomes may impair people\u2019s ability to savor andenjoy the small pleasures of life (Kahneman, 2011). Indeed, researchers in one study found that participantsexposed to a subliminal reminder of wealth spent less time savoring a chocolate candy bar and exhibited lessenjoyment of this experience than did participants who were not reminded of wealth (Quoidbach, Dunn,Petrides, & Mikolajczak, 2010).What about education and employment? Happy people, compared to those who are less happy, are more likelyto graduate from college and secure more meaningful and engaging jobs. Once they obtain a job, they are alsomore likely to succeed (Lyubomirsky et al., 2005). While education shows a positive (but weak) correlation withhappiness, intelligence is not appreciably related to happiness (Diener et al., 1999).Does religiosity correlate with happiness? In general, the answer is yes (Hackney & Sanders, 2003). However,the relationship between religiosity and happiness depends on societal circumstances. Nations and states withmore difficult living conditions (e.g., widespread hunger and low life expectancy) tend to be more highlyreligious than societies with more favorable living conditions. Among those who live in nations with difficultliving conditions, religiosity is associated with greater well-being; in nations with more favorable livingconditions, religious and nonreligious individuals report similar levels of well-being (Diener, Tay, & Myers,"

What about theinfluence of one\u2019s culture? To the extent that people possess characteristics that are highly valued by theirculture, they tend to be happier (Diener, 2012). For example, self-esteem is a stronger predictor of lifesatisfaction in individualistic cultures than in collectivistic cultures (Diener, Diener, & Diener, 1995), andextraverted people tend to be happier in extraverted cultures than in introverted cultures (Fulmer et al., 2010).So we\u2019ve identified many factors that exhibit some correlation to happiness. What factors don\u2019t show acorrelation? Researchers have studied both parenthood and physical attractiveness as potential contributorsto happiness, but no link has been identified. Although people tend to believe that parenthood is central to ameaningful and fulfilling life, aggregate findings from a range of countries indicate that people who do nothave children are generally happier than those who do (Hansen, 2012). And although one\u2019s perceived level ofattractiveness seems to predict happiness, a person\u2019s objective physical attractiveness is only weaklycorrelated with their happiness (Diener, Wolsic, & Fujita, 1995).Life Events and HappinessAn important point should be considered regarding happiness. People are often poor at affective forecasting:predicting the intensity and duration of their future emotions (Wilson & Gilbert, 2003). In one study, nearly allnewlywed spouses predicted their marital satisfaction would remain stable or improve over the following fouryears; despite this high level of initial optimism, their marital satisfaction actually declined during this period(Lavner, Karner, & Bradbury, 2013). In addition, we are often incorrect when estimating how our long-termhappiness would change for the better or worse in response to certain life events. For example, it is easy formany of us to imagine how euphoric we would feel if we won the lottery, were asked on a date by an attractivecelebrity, or were offered our dream job. It is also easy to understand how long-suffering fans of the ChicagoCubs baseball team, which had not won a World Series championship since 1908, thought they would feelpermanently elated when their team finally won another World Series in 2016. Likewise, it is easy to predictthat we would feel permanently miserable if we suffered a disabling accident or if a romantic relationshipended.However, something similar to sensory adaptation often occurs when people experience emotional reactionsto life events. In much the same way our senses adapt to changes in stimulation (e.g., our eyes adapting tobright light after walking out of the darkness of a movie theater into the bright afternoon sun), we eventuallyadapt to changing emotional circumstances in our lives (Brickman & Campbell, 1971; Helson, 1964). When anevent that provokes positive or negative emotions occurs, at first we tend to experience its emotional impact atfull intensity. We feel a burst of pleasure following such things as a marriage proposal, birth of a child,acceptance to law school, an inheritance, and the like; as you might imagine, lottery winners experience asurge of happiness after hitting the jackpot (Lutter, 2007). Likewise, we experience a surge of misery followingwidowhood, a divorce, or a layoff from work. In the long run, however, we eventually adjust to the emotionalnew normal; the emotional impact of the event tends to erode, and we eventually revert to our original baselinehappiness levels. Thus, what was at first a thrilling lottery windfall or World Series championship eventuallyloses its luster and becomes the status quo (Figure 14.27). Indeed, dramatic life events have much less long-lasting impact on happiness than might be expected (Brickman, Coats, & Janoff-Bulman, 1978)."

(b) In ways that are similar,those who play the lottery rightfully think that choosing the correct numbers and winning millions would lead to asurge in happiness. However, the initial burst of elation following such elusive events would most likely erode withtime. (credit a: modification of work by Phil Roeder; credit b: modification of work by Robert S. Donovan)Recently, some have raised questions concerning the extent to which important life events can permanentlyalter people\u2019s happiness set points (Diener, Lucas, & Scollon, 2006). Evidence from a number of investigationssuggests that, in some circumstances, happiness levels do not revert to their original positions. For example,although people generally tend to adapt to marriage so that it no longer makes them happier or unhappierthan before, they often do not fully adapt to unemployment or severe disabilities (Diener, 2012). Figure 14.28,which is based on longitudinal data from a sample of over 3,000 German respondents, shows life satisfactionscores several years before, during, and after various life events, and it illustrates how people adapt (or fail toadapt) to these events. German respondents did not get lasting emotional boosts from marriage; instead, theyreported brief increases in happiness, followed by quick adaptation. In contrast, widows and those who hadbeen laid off experienced sizeable decreases in happiness that appeared to result in long-term changes in lifesatisfaction (Diener et al., 2006). Further, longitudinal data from the same sample showed that happinesslevels changed significantly over time for nearly a quarter of respondents, with 9% showing major changes(Fujita & Diener, 2005). Thus, long-term happiness levels can and do change for some people.FIGURE 14.28 This graphs shows life satisfaction scores several years before and after three significant life events(0 represents the year the event happened) (Diener et al., 2006).Increasing HappinessSome recent findings about happiness provide an optimistic picture, suggesting that real changes in happinessare possible. For example, thoughtfully developed well-being interventions designed to augment people\u2019sbaseline levels of happiness may increase happiness in ways that are permanent and long-lasting, not justtemporary. These changes in happiness may be targeted at individual, organizational, and societal levels"

Researchers in one study found that a series of happiness interventions involving suchexercises as writing down three good things that occurred each day led to increases in happiness that lastedover six months (Seligman et al., 2005).Measuring happiness and well-being at the societal level over time may assist policy makers in determining ifpeople are generally happy or miserable, as well as when and why they might feel the way they do. Studiesshow that average national happiness scores (over time and across countries) relate strongly to six keyvariables: per capita gross domestic product (GDP, which reflects a nation\u2019s economic standard of living), socialsupport, freedom to make important life choices, healthy life expectancy, freedom from perceived corruptionin government and business, and generosity (Helliwell et al., 2013). Investigating why people are happy orunhappy might help policymakers develop programs that increase happiness and well-being within a society(Diener et al., 2006). Resolutions about contemporary political and social issues that are frequent topics ofdebate\u2014such as poverty, taxation, affordable health care and housing, clean air and water, and incomeinequality\u2014might be best considered with people\u2019s happiness in mind.Positive PsychologyIn 1998, Seligman (the same person who conducted the learned helplessness experiments mentioned earlier),who was then president of the American Psychological Association, urged psychologists to focus more onunderstanding how to build human strength and psychological well-being. In deliberately setting out to createa new direction and new orientation for psychology, Seligman helped establish a growing movement and fieldof research called positive psychology (Compton, 2005). In a very general sense, positive psychology can bethought of as the science of happiness; it is an area of study that seeks to identify and promote those qualitiesthat lead to greater fulfillment in our lives. This field looks at people\u2019s strengths and what helps individuals tolead happy, contented lives, and it moves away from focusing on people\u2019s pathology, faults, and problems.According to Seligman and Csikszentmihalyi (2000), positive psychology,at the subjective level is about valued subjective experiences: well-being, contentment, andsatisfaction (in the past); hope and optimism (for the future); and\u2026 happiness (in the present). At theindividual level, it is about positive individual traits: the capacity for love and vocation, courage,interpersonal skill, aesthetic sensibility, perseverance, forgiveness, originality, future mindedness,spirituality, high talent, and wisdom. (p. 5)Some of the topics studied by positive psychologists include altruism and empathy, creativity, forgiveness andcompassion, the importance of positive emotions, enhancement of immune system functioning, savoring thefleeting moments of life, and strengthening virtues as a way to increase authentic happiness (Compton, 2005).Recent efforts in the field of positive psychology have focused on extending its principles toward peace andwell-being at the level of the global community. In a war-torn world in which conflict, hatred, and distrust arecommon, such an extended \u201cpositive peace psychology\u201d could have important implications for understandinghow to overcome oppression and work toward global peace (Cohrs, Christie, White, & Das, 2013).DIG DEEPERThe Center for Investigating Healthy MindsOn the campus of the University of Wisconsin\u2013Madison, the Center for Investigating Healthy Minds at theWaisman Center conducts rigorous scientific research on healthy aspects of the mind, such as kindness,forgiveness, compassion, and mindfulness. Established in 2008 and led by renowned neuroscientist Dr. RichardJ. Davidson, the Center examines a wide range of ideas, including such things as a kindness curriculum inschools, neural correlates of prosocial behavior, psychological effects of Tai Chi training, digital games to fosterprosocial behavior in children, and the effectiveness of yoga and breathing exercises in reducing symptoms ofpost-traumatic stress disorder."

The Center continues to conduct scientific research with the aim of developing mental healthtraining approaches that help people to live happier, healthier lives.Positive Affect and OptimismTaking a cue from positive psychology, extensive research over the last 10-15 years has examined theimportance of positive psychological attributes in physical well-being. Qualities that help promotepsychological well-being (e.g., having meaning and purpose in life, a sense of autonomy, positive emotions,and satisfaction with life) are linked with a range of favorable health outcomes (especially improvedcardiovascular health) mainly through their relationships with biological functions and health behaviors (suchas diet, physical activity, and sleep quality) (Boehm & Kubzansky, 2012). The quality that has received attentionis positive affect, which refers to pleasurable engagement with the environment, such as happiness, joy,enthusiasm, alertness, and excitement (Watson, Clark, & Tellegen, 1988). The characteristics of positive affect,as with negative affect (discussed earlier), can be brief, long-lasting, or trait-like (Pressman & Cohen, 2005).Independent of age, gender, and income, positive affect is associated with greater social connectedness,emotional and practical support, adaptive coping efforts, and lower depression; it is also associated withlongevity and favorable physiological functioning (Steptoe, O\u2019Donnell, Marmot, & Wardle, 2008).Positive affect also serves as a protective factor against heart disease. In a 10-year study of Nova Scotians, therate of heart disease was 22% lower for each one-point increase on the measure of positive affect, from 1 (nopositive affect expressed) to 5 (extreme positive affect) (Davidson, Mostofsky, & Whang, 2010). In terms of ourhealth, the expression, \u201cdon\u2019t worry, be happy\u201d is helpful advice indeed. There has also been much worksuggesting that optimism\u2014the general tendency to look on the bright side of things\u2014is also a significantpredictor of positive health outcomes.Although positive affect and optimism are related in some ways, they are not the same (Pressman & Cohen,2005). Whereas positive affect is mostly concerned with positive feeling states, optimism has been regarded asa generalized tendency to expect that good things will happen (Chang, 2001). It has also been conceptualizedas a tendency to view life\u2019s stressors and difficulties as temporary and external to oneself (Peterson & Steen,2002). Numerous studies over the years have consistently shown that optimism is linked to longevity, healthierbehaviors, fewer postsurgical complications, better immune functioning among men with prostate cancer, andbetter treatment adherence (Rasmussen & Wallio, 2008). Further, optimistic people report fewer physicalsymptoms, less pain, better physical functioning, and are less likely to be rehospitalized following heartsurgery (Rasmussen, Scheier, & Greenhouse, 2009).FlowAnother factor that seems to be important in fostering a deep sense of well-being is the ability to derive flowfrom the things we do in life. Flow is described as a particular experience that is so engaging and engrossingthat it becomes worth doing for its own sake (Csikszentmihalyi, 1997). It is usually related to creativeendeavors and leisure activities, but it can also be experienced by workers who like their jobs or students wholove studying (Csikszentmihalyi, 1999). Many of us instantly recognize the notion of flow. In fact, the termderived from respondents\u2019 spontaneous use of the term when asked to describe how it felt when what theywere doing was going well. When people experience flow, they become involved in an activity to the pointwhere they feel they lose themselves in the activity. They effortlessly maintain their concentration and focus,they feel as though they have complete control of their actions, and time seems to pass more quickly thanusual (Csikszentmihalyi, 1997). Flow is considered a pleasurable experience, and it typically occurs whenpeople are engaged in challenging activities that require skills and knowledge they know they possess. Forexample, people would be more likely report flow experiences in relation to their work or hobbies than in"

When asked the question, \u201cDo you ever get involved in something so deeply that nothing elseseems to matter, and you lose track of time?\u201d about 20% of Americans and Europeans report having theseflow-like experiences regularly (Csikszentmihalyi, 1997).Although wealth and material possessions are nice to have, the notion of flow suggests that neither areprerequisites for a happy and fulfilling life. Finding an activity that you are truly enthusiastic about, somethingso absorbing that doing it is reward itself (whether it be playing tennis, studying Arabic, writing children\u2019snovels, or cooking lavish meals) is perhaps the real key. According to Csikszentmihalyi (1999), creatingconditions that make flow experiences possible should be a top social and political priority. How might thisgoal be achieved? How might flow be promoted in school systems? In the workplace? What potential benefitsmight be accrued from such efforts?In an ideal world, scientific research endeavors should inform us on how to bring about a better world for allpeople. The field of positive psychology promises to be instrumental in helping us understand what trulybuilds hope, optimism, happiness, healthy relationships, flow, and genuine personal fulfillment."

Mental disorders are usually associated with significant distress in social, occupational, orother important activities\u201d (2013). Psychopathology is the study of psychological disorders, including theirsymptoms, etiology (i.e., their causes), and treatment. The term psychopathologycan also refer to themanifestation of a psychological disorder. Although consensus can be difficult, it is extremely important formental health professionals to agree on what kinds of thoughts, feelings, and behaviors are truly abnormal inthe sense that they genuinely indicate the presence of psychopathology. Certain patterns of behavior and innerexperience can easily be labeled as abnormal and clearly signify some kind of psychological disturbance. Theperson who washes their hands 40 times per day and the person who claims to hear the voices of demonsexhibit behaviors and inner experiences that most would regard as abnormal: beliefs and behaviors thatsuggest the existence of a psychological disorder. But, consider the nervousness a young man feels whentalking to an attractive person or the loneliness and longing for home a first-year student experiences duringher first semester of college\u2014these feelings may not be regularly present, but they fall in the range of normal.So, what kinds of thoughts, feelings, and behaviors represent a true psychological disorder? Psychologists workto distinguish psychological disorders from inner experiences and behaviors that are merely situational,idiosyncratic, or unconventional.Mental health issues are often incorrectly viewed as less important than physical illnesses, and sometimespeople are blamed or otherwise stigmatized for their condition. People with mental illnesses did not choose orcreate their illness, and cannot simply manage it through positive thinking or other attitudinal changes.Diagnosis, treatment, and support are all necessary, and all must be considered with respect and sensitivity tothe extremely challenging nature of mental illness. While not everyone experiencing difficulty has apsychological disorder, mental health is critical to our ability to function in our relationships, education, andwork. It is important that people talk with qualified professionals if they are having persistent feelings orexperiences in line with the descriptions below; the discussion may or may not lead to a diagnosis, but as withphysical illnesses, one has a better chance at success if they raise the issues with doctors or other experts.Definition of a Psychological DisorderPerhaps the simplest approach to conceptualizing psychological disorders is to label behaviors, thoughts, andinner experiences that are atypical, distressful, dysfunctional, and sometimes even dangerous, as signs of adisorder. For example, if you ask a classmate for a date and you are rejected, you probably would feel a littledejected. Such feelings would be normal. If you felt extremely depressed\u2014so much so that you lost interest inactivities, had difficulty eating or sleeping, felt utterly worthless, and contemplated suicide\u2014your feelingswould be atypical, would deviate from the norm, and could signify the presence of a psychological disorder.Just because something is atypical, however, does not necessarily mean it is disordered.For example, only about 4% of people in the United States have red hair, so red hair is considered an atypicalcharacteristic (Figure 15.2), but it is not considered disordered, it\u2019s just unusual. And it is less unusual inScotland, where approximately 13% of the population has red hair (\u201cDNA Project Aims,\u201d 2012). As you willlearn, some disorders, although not exactly typical, are far from atypical, and the rates in which they appear inthe population are surprisingly high."

(a) Isla Fischer, (b) Prince Harry, and (c) MarciaCross are three natural redheads. (credit a: modification of work by Richard Goldschmidt; credit b: modification ofwork by Glyn Lowe; credit c: modification of work by Kirk Weaver)If we can agree that merely being atypical is an insufficient criterion for a having a psychological disorder, is itreasonable to consider behavior or inner experiences that differ from widely expected cultural values orexpectations as disordered? Using this criterion, a person who walks around a subway platform wearing aheavy winter coat in July while screaming obscenities at strangers may be considered as exhibiting symptomsof a psychological disorder. Their actions and clothes violate socially accepted rules governing appropriatedress and behavior; these characteristics are atypical.Cultural ExpectationsViolating cultural expectations is not, in and of itself, a satisfactory means of identifying the presence of apsychological disorder. Since behavior varies from one culture to another, what may be expected andconsidered appropriate in one culture may not be viewed as such in other cultures. For example, returning astranger\u2019s smile is expected in the United States because a pervasive social norm dictates that we reciprocatefriendly gestures. A person who refuses to acknowledge such gestures might be considered sociallyawkward\u2014perhaps even disordered\u2014for violating this expectation. However, such expectations are notuniversally shared. Cultural expectations in Japan involve showing reserve, restraint, and a concern formaintaining privacy around strangers. Japanese people are generally unresponsive to smiles from strangers(Patterson et al., 2007). Eye contact provides another example. In the United States and Europe, eye contactwith others typically signifies honesty and attention. However, most Latin-American, Asian, and Africancultures interpret direct eye contact as rude, confrontational, and aggressive (Pazain, 2010). Thus, someonewho makes eye contact with you could be considered appropriate and respectful or brazen and offensive,depending on your culture (Figure 15.3).FIGURE 15.3 Eye contact is one of many social gestures that vary from culture to culture.

In other cultures, visions that, for example, pertain to future events may be regarded as normalexperiences that are positively valued (Bourguignon, 1970). Finally, it is important to recognize that culturalnorms change over time: what might be considered typical in a society at one time may no longer be viewedthis way later, similar to how fashion trends from one era may elicit quizzical looks decades later\u2014imagine howa headband, legwarmers, and the big hair of the 1980s would go over on your campus today.DIG DEEPERThe Myth of Mental IllnessIn the 1950s and 1960s, the concept of mental illness was widely criticized. One of the major criticisms focusedon the notion that mental illness was a \u201cmyth that justifies psychiatric intervention in socially disapprovedbehavior\u201d (Wakefield, 1992). Thomas Szasz (1960), a noted psychiatrist, was perhaps the biggest proponent ofthis view. Szasz argued that the notion of mental illness was invented by society (and the mental healthestablishment) to stigmatize and subjugate people whose behavior violates accepted social and legal norms.Indeed, Szasz suggested that what appear to be symptoms of mental illness are more appropriatelycharacterized as \u201cproblems in living\u201d (Szasz, 1960).In his 1961 book, The Myth of Mental Illness: Foundations of a Theory of Personal Conduct, Szasz expressed hisdisdain for the concept of mental illness and for the field of psychiatry in general (Oliver, 2006). The basis forSzasz\u2019s attack was his contention that detectable abnormalities in bodily structures and functions (e.g.,infections and organ damage or dysfunction) represent the defining features of genuine illness or disease, andbecause symptoms of purported mental illness are not accompanied by such detectable abnormalities, so-calledpsychological disorders are not disorders at all. Szasz (1961/2010) proclaimed that \u201cdisease or illness can onlyaffect the body; hence, there can be no mental illness\u201d (p. 267).Today, we recognize the extreme level of psychological suffering experienced by people with psychologicaldisorders: the painful thoughts and feelings they experience, the disordered behavior they demonstrate, and thelevels of distress and impairment they exhibit. This makes it very difficult to deny the reality of mental illness.However controversial Szasz\u2019s views and those of his supporters might have been, they have influenced themental health community and society in several ways. First, lay people, politicians, and professionals now oftenrefer to mental illness as mental health \u201cproblems,\u201d implicitly acknowledging the \u201cproblems in living\u201dperspective Szasz described (Buchanan-Barker & Barker, 2009). Also influential was Szasz\u2019s view of sexualorientation. Szasz was perhaps the first psychiatrist to openly challenge the idea that same-sex attractionrepresented a form of mental illness or disease (Szasz, 1965), which helped pave the way for the social and civilrights that gay and lesbian people now have (Barker, 2010). His work also inspired legal changes that protect therights of people in psychiatric institutions and allow such individuals a greater degree of influence andresponsibility over their lives (Buchanan-Barker & Barker, 2009).Harmful DysfunctionIf none of the criterion discussed so far is adequate by itself to define the presence of a psychological disorder,how can a disorder be conceptualized? Many efforts have been made to identify the specific dimensions ofpsychological disorders, yet none is entirely satisfactory. No universal definition of psychological disorderexists that can apply to all situations in which a disorder is thought to be present (Zachar & Kendler, 2007).However, one of the more influential conceptualizations was proposed by Wakefield (1992), who definedpsychological disorder as a harmful dysfunction. Wakefield argued that natural internal mechanisms\u2014that is,psychological processes honed by evolution, such as cognition, perception, and learning\u2014have importantfunctions, such as enabling us to experience the world the way others do and to engage in rational thought,problem solving, and communication. For example, learning allows us to associate a fear with a potential"

Dysfunctionoccurs when an internal mechanism breaks down and can no longer perform its normal function. But, thepresence of a dysfunction by itself does not determine a disorder. The dysfunction must be harmful in that itleads to negative consequences for the individual or for others, as judged by the standards of the individual\u2019sculture. The harm may include significant internal anguish (e.g., high levels of anxiety or depression) orproblems in day-to-day living (e.g., in one\u2019s social or work life).To illustrate, Janet has an extreme fear of spiders. Janet\u2019s fear might be considered a dysfunction in that itsignals that the internal mechanism of learning is not working correctly (i.e., a faulty process prevents Janetfrom appropriately associating the magnitude of fear with the actual threat posed by spiders). Janet\u2019s fear ofspiders has a significant negative influence on daily life: she avoids all situations in which she suspects spidersto be present (e.g., the basement or a friend\u2019s home), and she quit her job last month because she saw a spiderin the restroom at work and is now unemployed. According to the harmful dysfunction model, Janet\u2019scondition would signify a disorder because (a) there is a dysfunction in an internal mechanism, and (b) thedysfunction has resulted in harmful consequences. Similar to how the symptoms of physical illness reflectdysfunctions in biological processes, the symptoms of psychological disorders presumably reflectdysfunctions in mental processes. The internal mechanism component of this model is especially appealingbecause it implies that disorders may occur through a breakdown of biological functions that govern variouspsychological processes, thus supporting contemporary neurobiological models of psychological disorders(Fabrega, 2007).The American Psychiatric Association (APA) DefinitionMany of the features of the harmful dysfunction model are incorporated in a formal definition of psychologicaldisorder developed by the American Psychiatric Association (APA). According to the APA (2013), apsychological disorder is a condition that is said to consist of the following:\u2022 There are significant disturbances in thoughts, feelings, and behaviors. A person must experienceinner states (e.g., thoughts and/or feelings) and exhibit behaviors that are clearly disturbed\u2014that is,unusual, but in a negative, self-defeating way. Often, such disturbances are troubling to those around theindividual who experiences them. For example, an individual who is uncontrollably preoccupied bythoughts of germs spends hours each day bathing, has inner experiences, and displays behaviors thatmost would consider atypical and negative (disturbed) and that would likely be troubling to familymembers.\u2022 The disturbances reflect some kind of biological, psychological, or developmental dysfunction.Disturbed patterns of inner experiences and behaviors should reflect some flaw (dysfunction) in theinternal biological, psychological, and developmental mechanisms that lead to normal, healthypsychological functioning. For example, the hallucinations observed in schizophrenia could be a sign ofbrain abnormalities.\u2022 The disturbances lead to significant distress or disability in one\u2019s life. A person\u2019s inner experiences andbehaviors are considered to reflect a psychological disorder if they cause the person considerable distress,or greatly impair their ability to function as a normal individual (often referred to as functionalimpairment, or occupational and social impairment). As an illustration, a person\u2019s fear of social situationsmight be so distressing that it causes the person to avoid all social situations (e.g., preventing that personfrom being able to attend class or apply for a job).\u2022 The disturbances do not reflect expected or culturally approved responses to certain events.Disturbances in thoughts, feelings, and behaviors must be socially unacceptable responses to certainevents that often happen in life. For example, it is perfectly natural (and expected) that a person wouldexperience great sadness and might wish to be left alone following the death of a close family member.Because such reactions are in some ways culturally expected, the individual would not be assumed tosignify a mental disorder."

In truth, no single approach to defining a psychologicaldisorder is adequate by itself, nor is there universal agreement on where the boundary is between disorderedand not disordered. From time to time we all experience anxiety, unwanted thoughts, and moments ofsadness; our behavior at other times may not make much sense to ourselves or to others. These innerexperiences and behaviors can vary in their intensity, but are only considered disordered when they are highlydisturbing to us and/or others, suggest a dysfunction in normal mental functioning, and are associated withsignificant distress or disability in social or occupational activities."

How do mental health professionals ascertain whether or not a person\u2019s inner states andbehaviors truly represent a psychological disorder? Arriving at a proper diagnosis\u2014that is, appropriatelyidentifying and labeling a set of defined symptoms\u2014is absolutely crucial. This process enables professionals touse a common language with others in the field and aids in communication about the disorder with thepatient, colleagues and the public. A proper diagnosis is an essential element to guide proper and successfultreatment. For these reasons, classification systems that organize psychological disorders systematically arenecessary.The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders(DSM)Although a number of classification systems have been developed over time, the one that is used by mostmental health professionals in the United States is the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders(DSM-5), published by the American Psychiatric Association (2013). (Note that the American PsychiatricAssociation differs from the American Psychological Association; both are abbreviated APA.) The first editionof the DSM, published in 1952, classified psychological disorders according to a format developed by the U.S.Army during World War II (Clegg, 2012). In the years since, the DSM has undergone numerous revisions andeditions. The most recent edition, published in 2013, is the DSM-5 (APA, 2013). The DSM-5 includes manycategories of disorders (e.g., anxiety disorders, depressive disorders, and dissociative disorders). Eachdisorder is described in detail, including an overview of the disorder (diagnostic features), specific symptomsrequired for diagnosis (diagnostic criteria), prevalence information (what percent of the population is thoughtto be afflicted with the disorder), and risk factors associated with the disorder. Figure 15.4 shows lifetimeprevalence rates\u2014the percentage of people in a population who develop a disorder in their lifetime\u2014of variouspsychological disorders among U.S. adults.

Because the data is from 2007, the categories shownhere are from the DSM-IV, which has been supplanted by the DSM-5. Most categories remain the same; however,alcohol abuse now falls under a broader Alcohol Use Disorder category.The DSM-5 also provides information about comorbidity; the co-occurrence of two disorders. For example, theDSM-5 mentions that 41% of people with obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) also meet the diagnosticcriteria for major depressive disorder (Figure 15.5). Problematic substance use is highly comorbid with othermental illnesses; 6 out of 10 people who have a substance use disorder also suffer from another form of mentalillness (National Institute on Drug Abuse [NIDA], 2007).FIGURE 15.5 Obsessive-compulsive disorder and major depressive disorder frequently occur in the same person.CONNECT THE CONCEPTSComorbidityAs you\u2019ve learned in the text, comorbidity refers to situations in which an individual suffers from more than onedisorder, and often the symptoms of each can interact in negative ways.

Conversely,around 10 percent of individuals seeking treatment for substance use disorder have serious mental illnesses.Observations such as these have important implications for treatment options that are available. When people witha mental illness are also habitual drug users, their symptoms can be exacerbated and resistant to treatment.Furthermore, it is not always clear whether the symptoms are due to drug use, the mental illness, or a combinationof the two. Therefore, it is recommended that behavior is observed in situations in which the individual has ceasedusing drugs and is no longer experiencing withdrawal from the drug in order to make the most accurate diagnosis(NIDA, 2018).Obviously, substance use disorders are not the only possible comorbidities. In fact, some of the most commonpsychological disorders tend to co-occur. For instance, more than half of individuals who have a primary diagnosis ofdepressive disorder are estimated to exhibit some sort of anxiety disorder. The reverse is also true for thosediagnosed with a primary diagnosis of an anxiety disorder. Further, anxiety disorders and major depression have ahigh rate of comorbidity with several other psychological disorders (Al-Asadi, Klein, & Meyer, 2015).The DSM has changed considerably in the half-century since it was originally published. The first two editionsof the DSM, for example, listed homosexuality as a disorder; however, in 1973, the APA voted to remove it fromthe manual (Silverstein, 2009). While the DSM-III did not list homosexuality as a disorder, it introduced a newdiagnosis, ego-dystonic homosexuality, which emphasized same-sex arousal that the patient viewed asinterfering with desired heterosexual relationships and causing distress for the individual. This new diagnosiswas considered by many as a compromise to appease those who viewed homosexuality as a mental illness.Other professionals questioned how appropriate it was to have a separate diagnosis that described the contentof an individual's distress. In 1986, the diagnosis was removed from the DSM-III-R (Herek, 2012). Additionally,beginning with the DSM-III in 1980, mental disorders have been described in much greater detail, and thenumber of diagnosable conditions has grown steadily, as has the size of the manual itself. DSM-I included 106diagnoses and was 130 total pages, whereas DSM-III included more than 2 times as many diagnoses (265) andwas nearly seven times its size (886 total pages) (Mayes & Horowitz, 2005). Although DSM-5 is longer thanDSM-IV, the volume includes only 237 disorders, a decrease from the 297 disorders that were listed in DSM-IV.The latest edition, DSM-5, includes revisions in the organization and naming of categories and in thediagnostic criteria for various disorders (Regier, Kuhl, & Kupfer, 2012), while emphasizing carefulconsideration of the importance of gender and cultural difference in the expression of various symptoms(Fisher, 2010).Some believe that establishing new diagnoses might overpathologize the human condition by turning commonhuman problems into mental illnesses (The Associated Press, 2013). Indeed, the finding that nearly half of allAmericans will meet the criteria for a DSM disorder at some point in their life (Kessler et al., 2005) likely fuelsmuch of this skepticism. The DSM-5 is also criticized on the grounds that its diagnostic criteria have beenloosened, thereby threatening to \u201cturn our current diagnostic inflation into diagnostic hyperinflation\u201d(Frances, 2012, para. 22). For example, DSM-IV specified that the symptoms of major depressive disorder mustnot be attributable to normal bereavement (loss of a loved one). The DSM-5, however, has removed thisbereavement exclusion, essentially meaning that grief and sadness after a loved one\u2019s death can constitutemajor depressive disorder.The International Classification of DiseasesA second classification system, the International Classification of Diseases(ICD), is also widely recognized.Published by the World Health Organization (WHO), the ICD was developed in Europe shortly after World WarII and, like the DSM, has been revised several times. The categories of psychological disorders in both the DSMand ICD are similar, as are the criteria for specific disorders; however, some differences exist. Although the ICDis used for clinical purposes, this tool is also used to examine the general health of populations and to monitorthe prevalence of diseases and other health problems internationally (WHO, 2013). The ICD is in its 10th"

Mostresearch findings concerning the etiology and treatment of psychological disorders are based on criteria setforth in the DSM (Oltmanns & Castonguay, 2013). The DSM also includes more explicit disorder criteria, alongwith an extensive and helpful explanatory text (Regier et al., 2012). The DSM is the classification system ofchoice among U.S. mental health professionals, and this chapter is based on the DSM paradigm.The Compassionate View of Psychological DisordersAs these disorders are outlined, please bear two things in mind. First, remember that psychological disordersrepresent extremesof inner experience and behavior. If, while reading about these disorders, you feel thatthese descriptions begin to personally characterize you, do not worry\u2014this moment of enlightenment probablymeans nothing more than you have had a range of experiences and emotions. Each of us experiences episodesof sadness, anxiety, and preoccupation with certain thoughts\u2014times when we do not quite feel ourselves.These episodes should not be considered problematic unless the accompanying thoughts and behaviorsbecome extreme and have a disruptive effect on one\u2019s life. Second, understand that people with psychologicaldisorders are far more than just embodiments of their disorders. We do not use terms such as schizophrenics,depressives, or phobics because they are labels that objectify people who have these conditions, thuspromoting biased and disparaging assumptions about them. It is important to remember that a psychologicaldisorder is not what a person is; it is something that a person has\u2014through no fault of their own. As is the casewith cancer or diabetes, those with psychological disorders suffer debilitating, often painful conditions that arenot of their own choosing. These individuals deserve to be viewed and treated with compassion,understanding, and dignity."

The specific perspective used in explaining a psychological disorder is extremely important. Eachperspective explains psychological disorders, their causes or etiology, and effective treatments from a differentviewpoint. Different perspectives provide alternate ways for how to think about the nature of psychopathology.Supernatural Perspectives of Psychological DisordersFor centuries, psychological disorders were viewed from a supernatural perspective: attributed to a forcebeyond scientific understanding. Those afflicted were thought to be practitioners of black magic or possessedby spirits (Figure 15.6) (Maher & Maher, 1985). For example, convents throughout Europe in the 16th and 17thcenturies reported hundreds of nuns falling into a state of frenzy in which the afflicted foamed at the mouth,screamed and convulsed, sexually propositioned priests, and confessed to having carnal relations with devilsor Christ. Although, today, these cases would suggest serious mental illness; at the time, these events wereroutinely explained as possession by devilish forces (Waller, 2009a). Similarly, grievous fits by young girls arebelieved to have precipitated the witch panic in New England late in the 17th century (Demos, 1983). Suchbeliefs in supernatural causes of mental illness are still held in some societies today; for example, beliefs thatsupernatural forces cause mental illness are common in some cultures in modern-day Nigeria (Aghukwa,"

Groups of people wouldsuddenly begin to dance with wild abandon. This compulsion to dance\u2014referred to as dancingmania\u2014sometimes gripped thousands of people at a time (Figure 15.7). Historical accounts indicate that thoseafflicted would sometimes dance with bruised and bloody feet for days or weeks, screaming of terrible visionsand begging priests and monks to save their souls (Waller, 2009b). What caused dancing mania is not known, butseveral explanations have been proposed, including spider venom and ergot poisoning (\u201cDancing Mania,\u201d 2011).FIGURE 15.7 Although the cause of dancing mania, depicted in this painting, was unclear, the behavior wasattributed to supernatural forces.Historian John Waller (2009a, 2009b) has provided a comprehensive and convincing explanation of dancingmania that suggests the phenomenon was attributable to a combination of three factors: psychological distress,social contagion, and belief in supernatural forces. Waller argued that various disasters of the time (such asfamine, plagues, and floods) produced high levels of psychological distress that could increase the likelihood of"

Waller indicated that anthropological studies and accounts ofpossession rituals show that people are more likely to enter a trance state if they expect it to happen, and thatentranced individuals behave in a ritualistic manner, their thoughts and behavior shaped by the spiritual beliefsof their culture. Thus, during periods of extreme physical and mental distress, all it took were a fewpeople\u2014believing themselves to have been afflicted with a dancing curse\u2014to slip into a spontaneous trance andthen act out the part of one who is cursed by dancing for days on end.Biological Perspectives of Psychological DisordersThe biological perspective views psychological disorders as linked to biological phenomena, such as geneticfactors, chemical imbalances, and brain abnormalities; it has gained considerable attention and acceptance inrecent decades (Wyatt & Midkiff, 2006). Evidence from many sources indicates that most psychologicaldisorders have a genetic component; in fact, there is little dispute that some disorders are largely due togenetic factors. The graph in Figure 15.8 shows heritability estimates for schizophrenia.FIGURE 15.8 A person\u2019s risk of developing schizophrenia increases if a relative has schizophrenia. The closer thegenetic relationship, the higher the risk.Findings such as these have led many of today\u2019s researchers to search for specific genes and genetic mutationsthat contribute to mental disorders. Also, sophisticated neural imaging technology in recent decades hasrevealed how abnormalities in brain structure and function might be directly involved in many disorders, andadvances in our understanding of neurotransmitters and hormones have yielded insights into their possibleconnections. The biological perspective is currently thriving in the study of psychological disorders.The Diathesis-Stress Model of Psychological DisordersDespite advances in understanding the biological basis of psychological disorders, the psychosocialperspective is still very important. This perspective emphasizes the importance of learning, stress, faulty andself-defeating thinking patterns, and environmental factors. Perhaps the best way to think about psychologicaldisorders, then, is to view them as originating from a combination of biological and psychological processes.Many develop not from a single cause, but from a delicate fusion between partly biological and partlypsychosocial factors.The diathesis-stress model (Zuckerman, 1999) integrates biological and psychosocial factors to predict thelikelihood of a disorder. This diathesis-stress model suggests that people with an underlying predisposition for"

A diathesis is not always a biological vulnerability to an illness; some diatheses may bepsychological (e.g., a tendency to think about life events in a pessimistic, self-defeating way).The key assumption of the diathesis-stress model is that both factors, diathesis and stress, are necessary in thedevelopment of a disorder. Different models explore the relationship between the two factors: the level ofstress needed to produce the disorder is inversely proportional to the level of diathesis."

Although anxiety is closely related to fear, the two statespossess important differences. Fear involves an instantaneous reaction to an imminent threat, whereasanxiety involves apprehension, avoidance, and cautiousness regarding a potential threat, danger, or othernegative event (Craske, 1999). While anxiety is unpleasant to most people, it is important to our health, safety,and well-being. Anxiety motivates us to take actions\u2014such as preparing for exams, watching our weight,showing up to work on time\u2014that enable us to avert potential future problems. Anxiety also motivates us toavoid certain things\u2014such as running up debts and engaging in illegal activities\u2014that could lead to futuretrouble. Most individuals\u2019 level and duration of anxiety approximates the magnitude of the potential threatthey face. For example, suppose a student who came to the U.S. as a \u201cDreamer\u201d (someone whose parents didn\u2019tlawfully immigrate) is concerned about the possibility of being unable to continue in the university program orof losing access to academic financial aid, due to changes and litigation around the Deferred Action forChildhood Arrivals (DACA) program. This person likely would experience anxiety of greater intensity andduration than would a 21-year-old junior who entered college as a birthright citizen. Some people experienceanxiety that is excessive, persistent, and greatly out of proportion to the actual threat; if one\u2019s anxiety has adisruptive influence on one\u2019s life, this is a strong indicator that the individual is experiencing an anxietydisorder.Anxiety disorders are characterized by excessive and persistent fear and anxiety, and by related disturbancesin behavior (APA, 2013). Although anxiety is universally experienced, anxiety disorders cause considerabledistress. As a group, anxiety disorders are common: approximately 25%\u201330% of the U.S. population meets thecriteria for at least one anxiety disorder during their lifetime (Kessler et al., 2005). Also, these disorders appearto be much more common in women than they are in men; within a 12-month period, around 23% of womenand 14% of men will experience at least one anxiety disorder (National Comorbidity Survey, 2007). Anxietydisorders are the most frequently occurring class of mental disorders and are often comorbid with each otherand with other mental disorders (Kessler, Ruscio, Shear, & Wittchen, 2009).Specific PhobiaPhobiais a Greek word that means fear. A person diagnosed with a specific phobia (formerly known as simplephobia) experiences excessive, distressing, and persistent fear or anxiety about a specific object or situation(such as animals, enclosed spaces, elevators, or flying) (APA, 2013). Even though people realize their level offear and anxiety in relation to the phobic stimulus is irrational, some people with a specific phobia may go togreat lengths to avoid the phobic stimulus (the object or situation that triggers the fear and anxiety). Typically,the fear and anxiety a phobic stimulus elicits is disruptive to the person\u2019s life. For example, a man with aphobia of flying might refuse to accept a job that requires frequent air travel, thus negatively affecting his"

Clinicians who have worked with people who have specific phobias have encountered many kinds ofphobias, some of which are shown in Table 15.1.15.4 \u2022 Anxiety Disorders 549Specific PhobiasPhobiaFeared Object or SituationAcrophobiaheightsAerophobiaflyingArachnophobia spidersClaustrophobia enclosed spacesCynophobiadogsHematophobiabloodOphidiophobiasnakesTaphophobiabeing buried aliveTrypanophobiainjectionsXenophobiastrangersTABLE 15.1Specific phobias are common; in the United States, around 12.5% of the population will meet the criteria for aspecific phobia at some point in their lifetime (Kessler et al., 2005). One type of phobia, agoraphobia, is listedin the DSM-5 as a separate anxiety disorder. Agoraphobia, which literally means \u201cfear of the marketplace,\u201d ischaracterized by intense fear, anxiety, and avoidance of situations in which it might be difficult to escape orreceive help if one experiences symptoms of a panic attack (a state of extreme anxiety that we will discussshortly). These situations include public transportation, open spaces (parking lots), enclosed spaces (stores),crowds, or being outside the home alone (APA, 2013). About 1.4% of Americans experience agoraphobiaduring their lifetime (Kessler et al., 2005).Acquisition of Phobias Through LearningMany theories suggest that phobias develop through learning. Rachman (1977) proposed that phobias can beacquired through three major learning pathways. The first pathway is through classical conditioning. As youmay recall, classical conditioning is a form of learning in which a previously neutral stimulus is paired with anunconditioned stimulus (UCS) that reflexively elicits an unconditioned response (UCR), eliciting the sameresponse through its association with the unconditioned stimulus. The response is called a conditionedresponse (CR). For example, a child who has been bitten by a dog may come to fear dogs because of a pastassociation with pain. In this case, the dog bite is the UCS and the fear it elicits is the UCR. Because a dog wasassociated with the bite, any dog may come to serve as a conditioned stimulus, thereby eliciting fear; the fearthe child experiences around dogs, then, becomes a CR.The second pathway of phobia acquisition is through vicarious learning, such as modeling. For example, achild who observes their cousin react fearfully to spiders may later express the same fears, even thoughspiders have never presented any danger to them. This phenomenon has been observed in both humans andnonhuman primates (Olsson & Phelps, 2007). A study of laboratory-reared monkeys readily acquired a fear of"

For example, a child whose parents, siblings,friends, and classmates constantly tell them how disgusting and dangerous snakes are may come to acquire afear of snakes.Interestingly, people are more likely to develop phobias of things that do not represent much actual danger tothemselves, such as animals and heights, and are less likely to develop phobias toward things that presentlegitimate danger in contemporary society, such as motorcycles and weapons (\u00d6hman & Mineka, 2001). Whymight this be so? One theory suggests that the human brain is evolutionarily predisposed to more readilyassociate certain objects or situations with fear (Seligman, 1971). This theory argues that throughout ourevolutionary history, our ancestors associated certain stimuli (e.g., snakes, spiders, heights, and thunder) withpotential danger. As time progressed, the mind has become adapted to more readily develop fears of thesethings than of others. Experimental evidence has consistently demonstrated that conditioned fears developmore readily to fear-relevant stimuli (images of snakes and spiders) than to fear-irrelevant stimuli (images offlowers and berries) (\u00d6hman & Mineka, 2001). Such prepared learning has also been shown to occur inmonkeys. In one study (Cook & Mineka, 1989), monkeys watched videotapes of model monkeys reactingfearfully to either fear-relevant stimuli (toy snakes or a toy crocodile) or fear-irrelevant stimuli (flowers or a toyrabbit). The observer monkeys developed fears of the fear-relevant stimuli but not the fear-irrelevant stimuli.Social Anxiety DisorderSocial anxiety disorder (formerly called social phobia) is characterized by extreme and persistent fear oranxiety and avoidance of social situations in which the person could potentially be evaluated negatively byothers (APA, 2013). As with specific phobias, social anxiety disorder is common in the United States; a littleover 12% of all Americans experience social anxiety disorder during their lifetime (Kessler et al., 2005).The heart of the fear and anxiety in social anxiety disorder is the person\u2019s concern that they may act in ahumiliating or embarrassing way, such as appearing foolish, showing symptoms of anxiety (blushing), or doingor saying something that might lead to rejection (such as offending others). The kinds of social situations inwhich individuals with social anxiety disorder usually have problems include public speaking, having aconversation, meeting strangers, eating in restaurants, and, in some cases, using public restrooms. Althoughmany people become anxious in social situations like public speaking, the fear, anxiety, and avoidanceexperienced in social anxiety disorder are highly distressing and lead to serious impairments in life. Adultswith this disorder are more likely to experience lower educational attainment and lower earnings (Katzelnicket al., 2001), perform more poorly at work and are more likely to be unemployed (Moitra, Beard, Weisberg, &Keller, 2011), and report greater dissatisfaction with their family lives, friends, leisure activities, and income(Stein & Kean, 2000).When people with social anxiety disorder are unable to avoid situations that provoke anxiety, they typicallyperform safety behaviors: mental or behavioral acts that reduce anxiety in social situations by reducing thechance of negative social outcomes. Safety behaviors include avoiding eye contact, rehearsing sentencesbefore speaking, talking only briefly, and not talking about oneself (Alden & Bieling, 1998). Other examples ofsafety behaviors include the following (Marker, 2013):\u2022 assuming roles in social situations that minimize interaction with others (e.g., taking pictures, setting upequipment, or helping prepare food)\u2022 asking people many questions to keep the focus off of oneself\u2022 selecting a position to avoid scrutiny or contact with others (sitting in the back of the room)\u2022 wearing bland, neutral clothes to avoid drawing attention to oneself\u2022 avoiding substances or activities that might cause anxiety symptoms (such as caffeine, warm clothing, andphysical exercise)Although these behaviors are intended to prevent the person with social anxiety disorder from doing"

The use of alcohol whenfaced with such situations may become negatively reinforcing: encouraging individuals with social anxietydisorder to turn to the substance whenever they experience anxiety symptoms. The tendency to use alcohol asa coping mechanism for social anxiety, however, can come with a hefty price tag: a number of large scalestudies have reported a high rate of comorbidity between social anxiety disorder and alcohol use disorder(Morris, Stewart, & Ham, 2005).As with specific phobias, it is highly probable that the fears inherent to social anxiety disorder can developthrough conditioning experiences. For example, a child who is subjected to early unpleasant socialexperiences (e.g., bullying at school) may develop negative social images of herself that become activated laterin anxiety-provoking situations (Hackmann, Clark, & McManus, 2000). Indeed, one study reported that 92% ofa sample of adults with social anxiety disorder reported a history of severe teasing in childhood, compared toonly 35% of a sample of adults with panic disorder (McCabe, Antony, Summerfeldt, Liss, & Swinson, 2003).One of the most well-established risk factors for developing social anxiety disorder is behavioral inhibition(Clauss & Blackford, 2012). Behavioral inhibition is thought to be an inherited trait, and it is characterized by aconsistent tendency to show fear and restraint when presented with unfamiliar people or situations (Kagan,Reznick, & Snidman, 1988). Behavioral inhibition is displayed very early in life; behaviorally inhibited toddlersand children respond with great caution and restraint in unfamiliar situations, and they are often timid,fearful, and shy around unfamiliar people (Fox, Henderson, Marshall, Nichols, & Ghera, 2005). A recentstatistical review of studies demonstrated that behavioral inhibition was associated with more than a sevenfoldincrease in the risk of development of social anxiety disorder, demonstrating that behavioral inhibition is amajor risk factor for the disorder (Clauss & Blackford, 2012).Panic DisorderImagine that you are at the mall one day with your friends and\u2014suddenly and inexplicably\u2014you begin sweatingand trembling, your heart starts pounding, you have trouble breathing, and you start to feel dizzy andnauseous. This episode lasts for 10 minutes and is terrifying because you start to think that you are going todie. When you visit your doctor the following morning and describe what happened, she tells you that you haveexperienced a panic attack (Figure 15.9). If you experience another one of these episodes two weeks later andworry for a month or more that similar episodes will occur in the future, it is likely that you have developedpanic disorder."

People may also experiencesweating, trembling, feelings of faintness, or a fear of losing control, among other symptoms.People with panic disorder experience recurrent (more than one) and unexpected panic attacks, along with atleast one month of persistent concern about additional panic attacks, worry over the consequences of theattacks, or self-defeating changes in behavior related to the attacks (e.g., avoidance of exercise or unfamiliarsituations) (APA, 2013). As is the case with other anxiety disorders, the panic attacks cannot result from thephysiological effects of drugs and other substances, a medical condition, or another mental disorder. A panicattack is defined as a period of extreme fear or discomfort that develops abruptly and reaches a peak within 10minutes. Its symptoms include accelerated heart rate, sweating, trembling, choking sensations, hot flashes orchills, dizziness or lightheadedness, fears of losing control or going crazy, and fears of dying (APA, 2013).Sometimes panic attacks are expected, occurring in response to specific environmental triggers (such as beingin a tunnel); other times, these episodes are unexpected and emerge randomly (such as when relaxing).According to the DSM-5, the person must experience unexpected panic attacks to qualify for a diagnosis ofpanic disorder.Experiencing a panic attack is often terrifying. Rather than recognizing the symptoms of a panic attack merelyas signs of intense anxiety, individuals with panic disorder often misinterpret them as a sign that something isintensely wrong internally (thinking, for example, that the pounding heart represents an impending heartattack). Panic attacks can occasionally precipitate trips to the emergency room because several symptoms ofpanic attacks are, in fact, similar to those associated with heart problems (e.g., palpitations, racing pulse, and apounding sensation in the chest) (Root, 2000). Unsurprisingly, those with panic disorder fear future attacksand may become preoccupied with modifying their behavior in an effort to avoid future panic attacks. For thisreason, panic disorder is often characterized as fear of fear (Goldstein & Chambless, 1978).Panic attacks themselves are not mental disorders. Indeed, around 23% of Americans experience isolatedpanic attacks in their lives without meeting the criteria for panic disorder (Kessler et al., 2006), indicating thatpanic attacks are fairly common. Panic disorder is, of course, much less common, afflicting 4.7% of Americansduring their lifetime (Kessler et al., 2005). Many people with panic disorder develop agoraphobia, which ismarked by fear and avoidance of situations in which escape might be difficult or help might not be available ifone were to develop symptoms of a panic attack. People with panic disorder often experience a comorbiddisorder, such as other anxiety disorders or major depressive disorder (APA, 2013).Researchers are not entirely sure what causes panic disorder. Children are at a higher risk of developing panic"

The exact genes and genefunctions involved in this disorder, however, are not well-understood (APA, 2013). Neurobiological theories ofpanic disorder suggest that a region of the brain called the locus coeruleus may play a role in this disorder.Located in the brainstem, the locus coeruleus is the brain\u2019s major source of norepinephrine, aneurotransmitter that triggers the body\u2019s fight-or-flight response. Activation of the locus coeruleus isassociated with anxiety and fear, and research with nonhuman primates has shown that stimulating the locuscoeruleus either electrically or through drugs produces panic-like symptoms (Charney et al., 1990). Suchfindings have led to the theory that panic disorder may be caused by abnormal norepinephrine activity in thelocus coeruleus (Bremner, Krystal, Southwick, & Charney, 1996).Conditioning theories of panic disorder propose that panic attacks are classical conditioning responses tosubtle bodily sensations resembling those normally occurring when one is anxious or frightened (Bouton,Mineka, & Barlow, 2001). For example, consider a child who has asthma. An acute asthma attack producessensations, such as shortness of breath, coughing, and chest tightness, that typically elicit fear and anxiety.Later, when the child experiences subtle symptoms that resemble the frightening symptoms of earlier asthmaattacks (such as shortness of breath after climbing stairs), they may become anxious, fearful, and thenexperience a panic attack. In this situation, the subtle symptoms would represent a conditioned stimulus, andthe panic attack would be a conditioned response. The finding that panic disorder is nearly three times asfrequent among people with asthma as it is among people without asthma (Weiser, 2007) supports thepossibility that panic disorder has the potential to develop through classical conditioning.Cognitive factors may play an integral part in panic disorder. Generally, cognitive theories (Clark, 1996) arguethat those with panic disorder are prone to interpret ordinary bodily sensations catastrophically, and thesefearful interpretations set the stage for panic attacks. For example, a person might detect bodily changes thatare routinely triggered by innocuous events such as getting up from a seated position (dizziness), exercising(increased heart rate, shortness of breath), or drinking a large cup of coffee (increased heart rate, trembling).The individual interprets these subtle bodily changes catastrophically (\u201cMaybe I\u2019m having a heart attack!\u201d).Such interpretations create fear and anxiety, which trigger additional physical symptoms; subsequently, theperson experiences a panic attack. Support of this contention rests with findings that people with more severecatastrophic thoughts about sensations have more frequent and severe panic attacks, and among those withpanic disorder, reducing catastrophic cognitions about their sensations is as effective as medication inreducing panic attacks (Good & Hinton, 2009).Generalized Anxiety DisorderAlex was always worried about many things. He worried that his children would drown when they played at thebeach. Each time he left the house, he worried that an electrical short circuit would start a fire in his home. Heworried that his husband would lose his job at the prestigious law firm. He worried that his daughter\u2019s minorstaph infection could turn into a massive life-threatening condition. These and other worries constantlyweighed heavily on Alex\u2019s mind, so much so that they made it difficult for him to make decisions and often lefthim feeling tense, irritable, and worn out. One night, Alex\u2019s husband was to drive their son home from a soccergame. However, his husband stayed after the game and talked with some of the other parents, resulting in himarriving home 45 minutes late. Alex had tried to call his cell phone three or four times, but he could not getthrough because the soccer field did not have a signal. Extremely worried, Alex eventually called the police,convinced that his husband and son had not arrived home because they had been in a terrible car accident.Alex suffers from generalized anxiety disorder: a relatively continuous state of excessive, uncontrollable, andpointless worry and apprehension. People with generalized anxiety disorder often worry about routine,everyday things, even though their concerns are unjustified (Figure 15.10). For example, an individual mayworry about her health and finances, the health of family members, the safety of her children, or minormatters (e.g., being late for an appointment) without having any legitimate reason for doing so (APA, 2013).

Also, generalized anxiety disorder appears to increase the risk for heartattacks and strokes, especially in people with preexisting heart conditions (Martens et al., 2010).Although there have been few investigations aimed at determining the heritability of generalized anxietydisorder, a summary of available family and twin studies suggests that genetic factors play a modest role in thedisorder (Hettema et al., 2001). Cognitive theories of generalized anxiety disorder suggest that worryrepresents a mental strategy to avoid more powerful negative emotions (Aikins & Craske, 2001), perhapsstemming from earlier unpleasant or traumatic experiences. Indeed, one longitudinal study found thatchildhood maltreatment was strongly related to the development of this disorder during adulthood (Moffitt etal., 2007); worrying might distract people from remembering painful childhood experiences."

Many of us experience unwanted thoughts from timeto time (e.g., craving double cheeseburgers when dieting), and many of us engage in repetitive behaviors onoccasion (e.g., pacing when nervous). However, obsessive-compulsive and related disorders elevate theunwanted thoughts and repetitive behaviors to a status so intense that these cognitions and activities disruptdaily life. Included in this category are obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), body dysmorphic disorder, andhoarding disorder.Obsessive-Compulsive DisorderPeople with obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) experience thoughts and urges that are intrusive andunwanted (obsessions) and/or the need to engage in repetitive behaviors or mental acts (compulsions). Aperson with this disorder might, for example, spend hours each day washing his hands or constantly checkingand rechecking to make sure that a stove, faucet, or light has been turned off.Obsessions are more than just unwanted thoughts that seem to randomly jump into our head from time totime, such as recalling an insensitive remark a coworker made recently, and they are more significant than"

Rather,obsessions are characterized as persistent, unintentional, and unwanted thoughts and urges that are highlyintrusive, unpleasant, and distressing (APA, 2013). Common obsessions include concerns about germs andcontamination, doubts (\u201cDid I turn the water off?\u201d), order and symmetry (\u201cI need all the spoons in the tray to bearranged a certain way\u201d), and urges that are aggressive or lustful. Usually, the person knows that such thoughtsand urges are irrational and thus tries to suppress or ignore them, but has an extremely difficult time doing so.These obsessive symptoms sometimes overlap, such that someone might have both contamination andaggressive obsessions (Abramowitz & Siqueland, 2013).Compulsions are repetitive and ritualistic acts that are typically carried out primarily as a means to minimizethe distress that obsessions trigger or to reduce the likelihood of a feared event (APA, 2013). Compulsionsoften include such behaviors as repeated and extensive hand washing, cleaning, checking (e.g., that a door islocked), and ordering (e.g., lining up all the pencils in a particular way), and they also include such mental actsas counting, praying, or reciting something to oneself (Figure 15.11). Compulsions characteristic of OCD arenot performed out of pleasure, nor are they connected in a realistic way to the source of the distress or fearedevent. Approximately 2.3% of the U.S. population will experience OCD in their lifetime (Ruscio, Stein, Chiu, &Kessler, 2010) and, if left untreated, OCD tends to be a chronic condition creating lifelong interpersonal andpsychological problems (Norberg, Calamari, Cohen, & Riemann, 2008).FIGURE 15.11 (a) Repetitive hand washing and (b) checking (e.g., that a door is locked) are common compulsionsamong those with obsessive-compulsive disorder. (credit a: modification of work by the USDA; credit b: modificationof work by Bradley Gordon)Body Dysmorphic DisorderAn individual with body dysmorphic disorder is preoccupied with a perceived flaw in physical appearancethat is either nonexistent or barely noticeable to other people (APA, 2013). These perceived physical defectscause people to think they are unattractive, ugly, hideous, or deformed. These preoccupations can focus on anybodily area, but they typically involve the skin, face, or hair. The preoccupation with imagined physical flawsdrives the person to engage in repetitive and ritualistic behavioral and mental acts, such as constantly lookingin the mirror, trying to hide the offending body part, comparisons with others, and, in some extreme cases,cosmetic surgery (Phillips, 2005). An estimated 2.4% of the adults in the United States meet the criteria forbody dysmorphic disorder, with slightly higher rates in women than in men (APA, 2013).Hoarding DisorderAlthough hoarding was traditionally considered to be a symptom of OCD, considerable evidence suggests thathoarding represents an entirely different disorder (Mataix-Cols et al., 2010). People with hoarding disordercannot bear to part with personal possessions, regardless of how valueless or useless these possessions are. Asa result, these individuals accumulate excessive amounts of usually worthless items that clutter their livingareas (Figure 15.12). Often, the quantity of cluttered items is so excessive that the person is unable to use hiskitchen, or sleep in his bed. People who suffer from this disorder have great difficulty parting with itemsbecause they believe the items might be of some later use, or because they form a sentimental attachment to"

Importantly, a diagnosis of hoarding disorder is made only if the hoarding is not causedby another medical condition and if the hoarding is not a symptom of another disorder (e.g., schizophrenia)(APA, 2013).FIGURE 15.12 Those who suffer from hoarding disorder have great difficulty in discarding possessions, usuallyresulting in an accumulation of items that clutter living or work areas. (credit: \u201cpuuikibeach\u201d/Flickr)Causes of OCDThe results of family and twin studies suggest that OCD has a moderate genetic component. The disorder isfive times more frequent in the first-degree relatives of people with OCD than in people without the disorder(Nestadt et al., 2000). Additionally, the concordance rate of OCD among identical twins is around 57%;however, the concordance rate for fraternal twins is 22% (Bolton, Rijsdijk, O\u2019Connor, Perrin, & Eley, 2007).Studies have implicated about two dozen potential genes that may be involved in OCD; these genes regulate thefunction of three neurotransmitters: serotonin, dopamine, and glutamate (Pauls, 2010). Many of these studiesincluded small sample sizes and have yet to be replicated. Thus, additional research needs to be done in thisarea.A brain region that is believed to play a critical role in OCD is the orbitofrontal cortex (Kopell & Greenberg,2008), an area of the frontal lobe involved in learning and decision-making (Rushworth, Noonan, Boorman,Walton, & Behrens, 2011) (Figure 15.13). In people with OCD, the orbitofrontal cortex becomes especiallyhyperactive when they are provoked with tasks in which, for example, they are asked to look at a photo of atoilet or of pictures hanging crookedly on a wall (Simon, Kaufmann, M\u00fcsch, Kischkel, & Kathmann, 2010). Theorbitofrontal cortex is part of a series of brain regions that, collectively, is called the OCD circuit; this circuitconsists of several interconnected regions that influence the perceived emotional value of stimuli and theselection of both behavioral and cognitive responses (Graybiel & Rauch, 2000). As with the orbitofrontal cortex,other regions of the OCD circuit show heightened activity during symptom provocation (Rotge et al., 2008),which suggests that abnormalities in these regions may produce the symptoms of OCD (Saxena, Bota, & Brody,2001). Consistent with this explanation, people with OCD show a substantially higher degree of connectivity ofthe orbitofrontal cortex and other regions of the OCD circuit than do those without OCD (Beucke et al., 2013)."

However, one important limitation of these findings is the inability to explaindifferences in obsessions and compulsions. Another limitation is that the correlational relationship betweenneurological abnormalities and OCD symptoms cannot imply causation (Abramowitz & Siqueland, 2013).CONNECT THE CONCEPTSConditioning and OCDThe symptoms of OCD have been theorized to be learned responses, acquired and sustained as the result of acombination of two forms of learning: classical conditioning and operant conditioning (Mowrer, 1960; Steinmetz,Tracy, & Green, 2001). Specifically, the acquisition of OCD may occur first as the result of classical conditioning,whereby a neutral stimulus becomes associated with an unconditioned stimulus that provokes anxiety or distress.When an individual has acquired this association, subsequent encounters with the neutral stimulus trigger anxiety,including obsessive thoughts; the anxiety and obsessive thoughts (which are now a conditioned response) maypersist until they identify some strategy to relieve it. Relief may take the form of a ritualistic behavior or mentalactivity that, when enacted repeatedly, reduces the anxiety. Such efforts to relieve anxiety constitute an example ofnegative reinforcement (a form of operant conditioning). Recall from the chapter on learning that negativereinforcement involves the strengthening of behavior through its ability to remove something unpleasant or aversive.Hence, compulsive acts observed in OCD may be sustained because they are negatively reinforcing, in the sensethat they reduce anxiety triggered by a conditioned stimulus.Suppose an individual with OCD experiences obsessive thoughts about germs, contamination, and diseasewhenever they encounter a doorknob. What might have constituted a viable unconditioned stimulus? Also, whatwould constitute the conditioned stimulus, unconditioned response, and conditioned response? What kinds ofcompulsive behaviors might we expect, and how do they reinforce themselves? What is decreased? Additionally,and from the standpoint of learning theory, how might the symptoms of OCD be treated successfully?"

Throughout much of the 20th century, this disorder was called shell shockand combatneurosisbecause its symptoms were observed in soldiers who had engaged in wartime combat. By the late1970s it had become clear that women who had experienced sexual traumas (e.g., rape, domestic battery, andincest) often experienced the same set of symptoms as did soldiers (Herman, 1997). The term posttraumaticstress disorderwas developed given that these symptoms could happen to anyone who experiencedpsychological trauma.A Broader Definition of PTSDPTSD was listed among the anxiety disorders in previous DSM editions. In DSM-5, it is now listed among agroup called Trauma-and-Stressor-Related Disorders. For a person to be diagnosed with PTSD, they must beexposed to, witness, or experience the details of a traumatic experience (e.g., a first responder), one thatinvolves \u201cactual or threatened death, serious injury, or sexual violence\u201d (APA, 2013, p. 271). These experiencescan include such events as combat, threatened or actual physical attack, sexual assault, natural disasters,terrorist attacks, and automobile accidents. This criterion makes PTSD the only disorder listed in the DSM inwhich a cause (extreme trauma) is explicitly specified.Symptoms of PTSD include intrusive and distressing memories of the event, flashbacks (states that can lastfrom a few seconds to several days, during which the individual relives the event and behaves as if the eventwere occurring at that moment [APA, 2013]), avoidance of stimuli connected to the event, persistently negativeemotional states (e.g., fear, anger, guilt, and shame), feelings of detachment from others, irritability, pronenesstoward outbursts, and an exaggerated startle response (jumpiness). For PTSD to be diagnosed, thesesymptoms must occur for at least one month.Roughly 7% of adults in the United States, including 9.7% of women and 3.6% of men, experience PTSD intheir lifetime (National Comorbidity Survey, 2007), with higher rates among people exposed to mass traumaand people whose jobs involve duty-related trauma exposure (e.g., police officers, firefighters, and emergencymedical personnel) (APA, 2013). Nearly 21% of residents of areas affected by Hurricane Katrina suffered fromPTSD one year following the hurricane (Kessler et al., 2008), and 12.6% of Manhattan residents were observedas having PTSD 2\u20133 years after the 9/11 terrorist attacks (DiGrande et al., 2008).Risk Factors For PTSDOf course, not everyone who experiences a traumatic event will go on to develop PTSD; several factors stronglypredict the development of PTSD: trauma experience, greater trauma severity, lack of immediate socialsupport, and more subsequent life stress (Brewin, Andrews, & Valentine, 2000). Traumatic events that involveharm by others (e.g., combat, rape, and sexual molestation) carry greater risk than do other traumas (e.g.,natural disasters) (Kessler, Sonnega, Bromet, Hughes, & Nelson, 1995). Women are more likely to have beentraumatized because of sexual trauma, childhood neglect, and childhood physical abuse. Men are more likelyto have been traumatized by natural disaster, life-threatening accident, and physical violence, either witnessedor directed at them. Adolescent boys are more likely to experience accident, physical assault, and witnessdeath/injury; adolescent girls are more likely to experience rape/sexual assault, intimate partner violence, orunexpected death or injury of a loved one. Assaultive violence and witnessing trauma to others is moreprevalent among non-White people when compared to White people. African American males are more likely"

A2012 study found that 27% of corrections officers reported experiencing symptoms of PTSD in the past 30days. Rates were higher for males (31%) than females (22%) (Spinaris, Denhof, & Kellaway, 2012). A studyconducted by Jaegers et al (2019) found that 53.4% of jail correctional officers screened positively for PTSD.PTSD is more prevalent in prison populations than in the general public, with prevalence estimates of 6% inmale prisoners and 21% in female prisoners (Facer-Irwin et al, 2019). Factors that increase the risk of PTSDinclude female gender, low socioeconomic status, low intelligence, personal history of mental disorders,history of childhood adversity (abuse or other trauma during childhood), and family history of mentaldisorders (Brewin et al., 2000). Personality characteristics such as neuroticism and somatization (the tendencyto experience physical symptoms when one encounters stress) have been shown to elevate the risk of PTSD(Bramsen, Dirkzwager, & van der Ploeg, 2000). People who experience childhood adversity and/or traumaticexperiences during adulthood are at significantly higher risk of developing PTSD if they possess one or twoshort versions of a gene that regulates the neurotransmitter serotonin (Xie et al., 2009). This suggests apossible diathesis-stress interpretation of PTSD: its development is influenced by the interaction ofpsychosocial and biological factors.Support For Sufferers of PTSDResearch has shown that social support following a traumatic event can reduce the likelihood of PTSD (Ozer,Best, Lipsey, & Weiss, 2003). Social support is often defined as the comfort, advice, and assistance receivedfrom relatives, friends, and neighbors. Social support can help individuals cope during difficult times byallowing them to discuss feelings and experiences and providing a sense of being loved and appreciated. A14-year study of 1,377 people who had served in the Vietnam War found that those who perceived less socialsupport when they came home were more likely to develop PTSD than were those who perceived greatersupport (Figure 15.14). In addition, those who became involved in the community were less likely to developPTSD, and they were more likely to experience a remission of PTSD than were those who were less involved(Koenen, Stellman, Stellman, & Sommer, 2003).FIGURE 15.14 PTSD was first recognized in soldiers who had engaged in combat.

(credit: KevinStanchfield)Learning and the Development of PTSDPTSD learning models suggest that some symptoms are developed and maintained through classicalconditioning. The traumatic event may act as an unconditioned stimulus that elicits an unconditionedresponse characterized by extreme fear and anxiety. Cognitive, emotional, physiological, and environmentalcues accompanying or related to the event are conditioned stimuli. These traumatic reminders evokeconditioned responses (extreme fear and anxiety) similar to those caused by the event itself (Nader, 2001). Aperson who witnessed or experienced a plane crash and who developed PTSD may display excessivehypervigilance and distress when planes fly overhead; this behavior constitutes a conditioned response to thetraumatic reminder (conditioned stimulus of the sight and sound of an airplane). Differences in howconditionable individuals are help to explain differences in the development and maintenance of PTSDsymptoms (Pittman, 1988). Conditioning studies demonstrate facilitated acquisition of conditioned responsesand delayed extinction of conditioned responses in people with PTSD (Orr et al., 2000).Cognitive factors are important in the development and maintenance of PTSD. One model suggests that twokey processes are crucial: disturbances in memory for the event, and negative appraisals of the trauma and itsaftermath (Ehlers & Clark, 2000). According to this theory, some people who experience traumas do not formcoherent memories of the trauma; memories of the traumatic event are poorly encoded and, thus, arefragmented, disorganized, and lacking in detail. Therefore, these individuals are unable remember the eventin a way that gives it meaning and context. A rape victim who cannot coherently remember the event mayremember only bits and pieces (e.g., the attacker repeating a word or insult); because the victim was unable todevelop a fully integrated memory, the fragmentary memory tends to stand out. Although unable to retrieve acomplete memory of the event, the victim may be haunted by intrusive fragments involuntarily triggered bystimuli associated with the event (e.g., memories of the attacker\u2019s comments when encountering a person whoresembles the attacker). This interpretation fits previously discussed material concerning PTSD andconditioning. The model also proposes that negative appraisals of the event (\u201cI deserved to be raped becauseI\u2019m stupid\u201d) may lead to dysfunctional behavioral strategies (e.g., avoiding social activities where men arelikely to be present) that maintain PTSD symptoms by preventing both a change in the nature of the memoryand a change in the problematic appraisals."

We become elated if ourfavorite team wins the World Series and dejected if a romantic relationship ends or if we lose our job. At times,we feel fantastic or miserable for no clear reason. People with mood disorders also experience moodfluctuations, but their fluctuations are extreme, distort their outlook on life, and impair their ability tofunction.FIGURE 15.15 Mood disorders are characterized by massive disruptions in mood. Symptoms can range from theextreme sadness and hopelessness of depression to the extreme elation and irritability of mania. (credit: KiranFoster)The DSM-5 lists two general categories of mood disorders. Depressive disorders are a group of disorders inwhich depression is the main feature. Depression is a vague term that, in everyday language, refers to anintense and persistent sadness. Depression is a heterogeneous mood state\u2014it consists of a broad spectrum ofsymptoms that range in severity. Depressed people feel sad, discouraged, and hopeless. These individuals loseinterest in activities once enjoyed, often experience a decrease in drives such as hunger and sex, andfrequently doubt personal worth. Depressive disorders vary by degree, but this chapter highlights the mostwell-known: major depressive disorder (sometimes called unipolar depression).Bipolar and related disorders are a group of disorders in which mania is the defining feature. Mania is a stateof extreme elation and agitation. When people experience mania, they may become extremely talkative,behave recklessly, or attempt to take on many tasks simultaneously. The most recognized of these disorders isbipolar disorder.Major Depressive DisorderAccording to the DSM-5, the defining symptoms of major depressive disorder include \u201cdepressed mood mostof the day, nearly every day\u201d (feeling sad, empty, hopeless, or appearing tearful to others), and loss of interestand pleasure in usual activities (APA, 2013). In addition to feeling overwhelmingly sad most of each day,people with depression will no longer show interest or enjoyment in activities that previously were gratifying,such as hobbies, sports, sex, social events, time spent with family, and so on. Friends and family members maynotice that the person has completely abandoned previously enjoyed hobbies; for example, an avid tennisplayer who develops major depressive disorder no longer plays tennis (Rothschild, 1999).To receive a diagnosis of major depressive disorder, one must experience a total of five symptoms for at least atwo-week period; these symptoms must cause significant distress or impair normal functioning, and theymust not be caused by substances or a medical condition.

Approximately 50%\u201360% of people who experience anepisode of major depressive disorder will have a second episode at some point in the future; those who havehad two episodes have a 70% chance of having a third episode, and those who have had three episodes have a90% chance of having a fourth episode (Rothschild, 1999). Although the episodes can last for months, amajority of people diagnosed with this condition (around 70%) recover within a year. However, a substantialnumber do not recover; around 12% show serious signs of impairment associated with major depressivedisorder after 5 years (Boland & Keller, 2009). In the long-term, many who do recover will still show minorsymptoms that fluctuate in their severity (Judd, 2012).Results of Major Depressive DisorderMajor depressive disorder is a serious and incapacitating condition that can have a devastating effect on thequality of one\u2019s life. The person suffering from this disorder lives a profoundly miserable existence that oftenresults in unavailability for work or education, abandonment of promising careers, and lost wages;occasionally, the condition requires hospitalization. The majority of those with major depressive disorderreport having faced some kind of discrimination, and many report that having received such treatment hasstopped them from initiating close relationships, applying for jobs for which they are qualified, and applyingfor education or training (Lasalvia et al., 2013). Major depressive disorder also takes a toll on health.Depression is a risk factor for the development of heart disease in healthy patients, as well as adversecardiovascular outcomes in patients with preexisting heart disease (Whooley, 2006).Risk Factors for Major Depressive DisorderMajor depressive disorder is often referred to as the common cold of psychiatric disorders. Around 6.6% of theU.S. population experiences major depressive disorder each year; 16.9% will experience the disorder duringtheir lifetime (Kessler & Wang, 2009). It is more common among women than among men, affectingapproximately 20% of women and 13% of men at some point in their life (National Comorbidity Survey, 2007).The greater risk among women is not accounted for by a tendency to report symptoms or to seek help morereadily, suggesting that gender differences in the rates of major depressive disorder may reflect biological andgender-related environmental experiences (Kessler, 2003).Lifetime rates of major depressive disorder tend to be highest in North and South America, Europe, andAustralia; they are considerably lower in Asian countries (Hasin, Fenton, & Weissman, 2011). The rates ofmajor depressive disorder are higher among younger age cohorts than among older cohorts, perhaps becausepeople in younger age cohorts are more willing to admit depression (Kessler & Wang, 2009).A number of risk factors are associated with major depressive disorder: unemployment (includinghomemakers); earning less than $20,000 per year; living in urban areas; or being separated, divorced, or"

Comorbid disorders include anxiety disorders and substance abuse disorders(Kessler & Wang, 2009).Subtypes of DepressionThe DSM-5 lists several different subtypes of depression. These subtypes\u2014what the DSM-5 refer to asspecifiers\u2014are not specific disorders; rather, they are labels used to indicate specific patterns of symptoms orto specify certain periods of time in which the symptoms may be present. One subtype, seasonal pattern,applies to situations in which a person experiences the symptoms of major depressive disorder only during aparticular time of year (e.g., fall or winter). In everyday language, people often refer to this subtype as thewinter blues.Another subtype, peripartum onset (commonly referred to as postpartum depression), applies to women whoexperience major depression during pregnancy or in the four weeks following the birth of their child (APA,2013). These women often feel very anxious and may even have panic attacks. They may feel guilty, agitated,and be weepy. They may not want to hold or care for their newborn, even in cases in which the pregnancy wasdesired and intended. In extreme cases, the mother may have feelings of wanting to harm her child or herself.In a horrific illustration, a woman named Andrea Yates, who suffered from extreme peripartum-onsetdepression (as well as other mental illnesses), drowned her five children in a bathtub (Roche, 2002). Mostwomen with peripartum-onset depression do not physically harm their children, but most do have difficultybeing adequate caregivers (Fields, 2010). A surprisingly high number of women experience symptoms ofperipartum-onset depression. A study of 10,000 women who had recently given birth found that 14% screenedpositive for peripartum-onset depression, and that nearly 20% reported having thoughts of wanting to harmthemselves (Wisner et al., 2013).People with persistent depressive disorder (previously known as dysthymia) experience depressed moodsmost of the day nearly every day for at least two years, as well as at least two of the other symptoms of majordepressive disorder. People with persistent depressive disorder are chronically sad and melancholy, but do notmeet all the criteria for major depression. However, episodes of full-blown major depressive disorder canoccur during persistent depressive disorder (APA, 2013).Bipolar DisorderA person with bipolar disorder (commonly known as manic depression) often experiences mood states thatvacillate between depression and mania; that is, the person\u2019s mood is said to alternate from one emotionalextreme to the other (in contrast to unipolar, which indicates a persistently sad mood).To be diagnosed with bipolar disorder, a person must have experienced a manic episode at least once in theirlife; although major depressive episodes are common in bipolar disorder, they are not required for a diagnosis(APA, 2013). According to the DSM-5, a manic episode is characterized as a \u201cdistinct period of abnormally andpersistently elevated, expansive, or irritable mood and abnormally and persistently increased activity orenergy lasting at least one week,\u201d that lasts most of the time each day (APA, 2013, p. 124). During a manicepisode, some experience a mood that is almost euphoric and become excessively talkative, sometimesspontaneously starting conversations with strangers; others become excessively irritable and complain ormake hostile comments. The person may talk loudly and rapidly, exhibiting flight of ideas, abruptly switchingfrom one topic to another. These individuals are easily distracted, which can make a conversation verydifficult. They may exhibit grandiosity, in which they experience inflated but unjustified self-esteem and self-confidence. For example, they might quit a job in order to \u201cstrike it rich\u201d in the stock market, despite lackingthe knowledge, experience, and capital for such an endeavor. They may take on several tasks at the same time(e.g., several time-consuming projects at work) and yet show little, if any, need for sleep; some may go for dayswithout sleep. Patients may also recklessly engage in pleasurable activities that could have harmfulconsequences, including spending sprees, reckless driving, making foolish investments, excessive gambling,or engaging in sexual encounters with strangers (APA, 2013)."

However,the reckless behaviors that often accompany these episodes\u2014which can be antisocial, illegal, or physicallythreatening to others\u2014may require involuntary hospitalization (APA, 2013). Some patients with bipolardisorder will experience a rapid-cycling subtype, which is characterized by at least four manic episodes (orsome combination of at least four manic and major depressive episodes) within one year.LINK TO LEARNINGIn the 1997 independent film Sweetheart, actress Janeane Garofalo plays the part of Jasmine, a young womanwith bipolar disorder. Watch this firsthand account from a person living with bipolar disorder(http://openstax.org/l/sweetheart) to learn more.Risk Factors for Bipolar DisorderBipolar disorder is considerably less frequent than major depressive disorder. In the United States, 1 out ofevery 167 people meets the criteria for bipolar disorder each year, and 1 out of 100 meet the criteria withintheir lifetime (Merikangas et al., 2011). The rates are higher in men than in women, and about half of thosewith this disorder report onset before the age of 25 (Merikangas et al., 2011). Around 90% of those with bipolardisorder have a comorbid disorder, most often an anxiety disorder or a substance abuse problem.Unfortunately, close to half of the people suffering from bipolar disorder do not receive treatment (Merikangas& Tohen, 2011). Suicide rates are extremely high among those with bipolar disorder: around 36% ofindividuals with this disorder attempt suicide at least once in their lifetime (Novick, Swartz, & Frank, 2010),and between 15%\u201319% die by suicide (Newman, 2004).The Biological Basis of Mood and Bipolar DisordersMood disorders have been shown to have a strong genetic and biological basis. Relatives of those with majordepressive disorder have double the risk of developing major depressive disorder, whereas relatives of patientswith bipolar disorder have over nine times the risk (Merikangas et al., 2011). The rate of concordance for majordepressive disorder is higher among identical twins than fraternal twins (50% vs. 38%, respectively), as is thatof bipolar disorder (67% vs. 16%, respectively), suggesting that genetic factors play a stronger role in bipolardisorder than in major depressive disorder (Merikangas et al. 2011).People with mood disorders often have imbalances in certain neurotransmitters, particularly norepinephrineand serotonin (Thase, 2009). These neurotransmitters are important regulators of the bodily functions that aredisrupted in mood disorders, including appetite, sex drive, sleep, arousal, and mood. Medications that areused to treat major depressive disorder typically boost serotonin and norepinephrine activity, whereaslithium\u2014used in the treatment of bipolar disorder\u2014blocks norepinephrine activity at the synapses (Figure15.16)."

People with depression show elevated amygdala activity (Drevets,Bogers, & Raichle, 2002), especially when presented with negative emotional stimuli, such as photos of sadfaces (Figure 15.17) (Surguladze et al., 2005). Interestingly, heightened amygdala activation to negativeemotional stimuli among depressed persons occurs even when stimuli are presented outside of consciousawareness (Victor, Furey, Fromm, \u00d6hman, & Drevets, 2010), and it persists even after the negative emotionalstimuli are no longer present (Siegle, Thompson, Carter, Steinhauer, & Thase, 2007). Additionally, depressedindividuals exhibit less activation in the prefrontal, particularly on the left side (Davidson, Pizzagalli, &Nitschke, 2009). Because the PFC can dampen amygdala activation, thereby enabling one to suppress negativeemotions (Phan et al., 2005), decreased activation in certain regions of the PFC may inhibit its ability tooverride negative emotions that might then lead to more negative mood states (Davidson et al., 2009). Thesefindings suggest that people with depression are more prone to react to emotionally negative stimuli, yet havegreater difficulty controlling these reactions."

(credit: Ian Munroe)Since the 1950s, researchers have noted that depressed individuals have abnormal levels of cortisol, a stresshormone released into the blood by the neuroendocrine system during times of stress (Mackin & Young, 2004).When cortisol is released, the body initiates a fight-or-flight response in reaction to a threat or danger. Manypeople with depression show elevated cortisol levels (Holsboer & Ising, 2010), especially those reporting ahistory of early life trauma such as the loss of a parent or abuse during childhood (Baes, Tofoli, Martins, &Juruena, 2012). Such findings raise the question of whether high cortisol levels are a cause or a consequence ofdepression. High levels of cortisol are a risk factor for future depression (Halligan, Herbert, Goodyer, & Murray,2007), and cortisol activates activity in the amygdala while deactivating activity in the PFC (McEwen,2005)\u2014both brain disturbances are connected to depression. Thus, high cortisol levels may have a causaleffect on depression, as well as on its brain function abnormalities (van Praag, 2005). Also, because stressresults in increased cortisol release (Michaud, Matheson, Kelly, Anisman, 2008), it is equally reasonable toassume that stress may precipitate depression.A Diathesis-Stress Model and Major Depressive DisordersIndeed, it has long been believed that stressful life events can trigger depression, and research hasconsistently supported this conclusion (Mazure, 1998). Stressful life events include significant losses, such asdeath of a loved one, divorce or separation, and serious health and money problems; life events such as theseoften precede the onset of depressive episodes (Brown & Harris, 1989). In particular, exit events\u2014instances inwhich an important person departs (e.g., a death, divorce or separation, or a family member leavinghome)\u2014often occur prior to an episode (Paykel, 2003). Exit events are especially likely to trigger depression ifthese happenings occur in a way that humiliates or devalues the individual. For example, people whoexperience the breakup of a relationship initiated by the other person develop major depressive disorder at arate more than 2 times that of people who experience the death of a loved one (Kendler, Hettema, Butera,Gardner, & Prescott, 2003).Likewise, individuals who are exposed to traumatic stress during childhood\u2014such as separation from a parent,family turmoil, and maltreatment (physical or sexual abuse)\u2014are at a heightened risk of developing depressionat any point in their lives (Kessler, 1997). A recent review of 16 studies involving over 23,000 subjectsconcluded that those who experience childhood maltreatment are more than 2 times as likely to developrecurring and persistent depression (Nanni, Uher, & Danese, 2012).Of course, not everyone who experiences stressful life events or childhood adversities succumbs todepression\u2014indeed, most do not. Clearly, a diathesis-stress interpretation of major depressive disorder, inwhich certain predispositions or vulnerability factors influence one\u2019s reaction to stress, would seem logical. Ifso, what might such predispositions be? A study by Caspi and others (2003) suggests that an alteration in aspecific gene that regulates serotonin (the 5-HTTLPR gene) might be one culprit. These investigators foundthat people who experienced several stressful life events were significantly more likely to experience episodesof major depression if they carried one or two short versions of this gene than if they carried two long versions.Those who carried one or two short versions of the 5-HTTLPR gene were unlikely to experience an episode,however, if they had experienced few or no stressful life events. Numerous studies have replicated these"

In a recent investigation conducted in the United Kingdom (Brown & Harris, 2013), researchers foundthat childhood maltreatment before age 9 elevated the risk of chronic adult depression (a depression episodelasting for at least 12 months) among those individuals having one (LS) or two (SS) short versions of the5-HTTLPR gene (Figure 15.18). Childhood maltreatment did not increase the risk for chronic depression forthose have two long (LL) versions of this gene. Thus, genetic vulnerability may be one mechanism throughwhich stress potentially leads to depression.FIGURE 15.18 A study on gene-environment interaction in people experiencing chronic depression in adulthoodsuggests a much higher incidence in individuals with a short version of the gene in combination with childhoodmaltreatment (Brown & Harris, 2013).Cognitive Theories of DepressionCognitive theories of depression take the view that depression is triggered by negative thoughts,interpretations, self-evaluations, and expectations (Joormann, 2009). These diathesis-stress models proposethat depression is triggered by a \u201ccognitive vulnerability\u201d (negative and maladaptive thinking) and byprecipitating stressful life events (Gotlib & Joormann, 2010). Perhaps the most well-known cognitive theory ofdepression was developed in the 1960s by psychiatrist Aaron Beck, based on clinical observations andsupported by research (Beck, 2008). Beck theorized that depression-prone people possess depressiveschemas, or mental predispositions to think about most things in a negative way (Beck, 1976). Depressiveschemas contain themes of loss, failure, rejection, worthlessness, and inadequacy, and may develop early inchildhood in response to adverse experiences, then remain dormant until they are activated by stressful ornegative life events. Depressive schemas prompt dysfunctional and pessimistic thoughts about the self, theworld, and the future. Beck believed that this dysfunctional style of thinking is maintained by cognitive biases,or errors in how we process information about ourselves, which lead us to focus on negative aspects ofexperiences, interpret things negatively, and block positive memories (Beck, 2008). A person whosedepressive schema consists of a theme of rejection might be overly attentive to social cues of rejection (morelikely to notice another\u2019s frown), and they might interpret this cue as a sign of rejection and automaticallyremember past incidents of rejection. Longitudinal studies have supported Beck\u2019s theory, in showing that apreexisting tendency to engage in this negative, self-defeating style of thinking\u2014when combined with lifestress\u2014over time predicts the onset of depression (Dozois & Beck, 2008). Cognitive therapies for depression,aimed at changing a depressed person\u2019s negative thinking, were developed as an expansion of this theory(Beck, 1976).Another cognitive theory of depression, hopelessness theory, postulates that a particular style of negativethinking leads to a sense of hopelessness, which then leads to depression (Abramson, Metalsky, & Alloy, 1989).According to this theory, hopelessness is an expectation that unpleasant outcomes will occur or that desiredoutcomes will not occur, and there is nothing one can do to prevent such outcomes. A key assumption of thistheory is that hopelessness stems from a tendency to perceive negative life events as having stable (\u201cIt\u2019s nevergoing to change\u201d) and global (\u201cIt\u2019s going to affect my whole life\u201d) causes, in contrast to unstable (\u201cIt\u2019s fixable\u201d)and specific (\u201cIt applies only to this particular situation\u201d) causes, especially if these negative life events occur"

Suppose a student whowishes to go to law school does poorly on an admissions test. If the student infers negative life events as havingstable and global causes, they may believe that their poor performance has a stable and global cause (\u201cI lackintelligence, and it\u2019s going to prevent me from ever finding a meaningful career\u201d), as opposed to an unstableand specific cause (\u201cI was sick the day of the exam, so my low score was a fluke\u201d). Hopelessness theory predictsthat people who exhibit this cognitive style in response to undesirable life events will view such events ashaving negative implications for their future and self-worth, thereby increasing the likelihood ofhopelessness\u2014the primary cause of depression (Abramson et al., 1989). One study testing hopelessness theorymeasured the tendency to make negative inferences for bad life effects in participants who were experiencinguncontrollable stressors. Over the ensuing six months, those with scores reflecting high cognitive vulnerabilitywere 7 times more likely to develop depression compared to those with lower scores (Kleim, Gonzalo, & Ehlers,2011).A third cognitive theory of depression focuses on how people\u2019s thoughts about their distressedmoods\u2014depressed symptoms in particular\u2014can increase the risk and duration of depression. This theory,which focuses on rumination in the development of depression, was first described in the late 1980s to explainthe higher rates of depression in women than in men (Nolen-Hoeksema, 1987). Rumination is the repetitiveand passive focus on the fact that one is depressed and dwelling on depressed symptoms, rather thatdistracting one\u2019s self from the symptoms or attempting to address them in an active, problem-solving manner(Nolen-Hoeksema, 1991). When people ruminate, they have thoughts such as \u201cWhy am I so unmotivated? I justcan\u2019t get going. I\u2019m never going to get my work done feeling this way\u201d (Nolen-Hoeksema & Hilt, 2009, p. 393).Women are more likely than men to ruminate when they are sad or depressed (Butler & Nolen-Hoeksema,1994), and the tendency to ruminate is associated with increases in depression symptoms (Nolen-Hoeksema,Larson, & Grayson, 1999), heightened risk of major depressive episodes (Abela & Hankin, 2011), andchronicity of such episodes (Robinson & Alloy, 2003)SuicideFor some people with mood disorders, the extreme emotional pain they experience becomes unendurable.Overwhelmed by hopelessness, devastated by incapacitating feelings of worthlessness, and burdened with theinability to adequately cope with such feelings, they may consider suicide to be a reasonable way out. Suicide,defined by the CDC as \u201cdeath caused by self-directed injurious behavior with any intent to die as the result ofthe behavior\u201d (CDC, 2013a), in a sense represents an outcome of several things going wrong all at the sametime (Crosby, Ortega, & Melanson, 2011). Not only must the person be biologically or psychologicallyvulnerable, but they must also have the means to perform the suicidal act, and they must lack the necessaryprotective factors (e.g., social support from friends and family, religion, coping skills, and problem-solvingskills) that provide comfort and enable one to cope during times of crisis or great psychological pain (Berman,2009).Suicide is not listed as a disorder in the DSM-5; however, people with a mental disorder\u2014especially a mooddisorder\u2014have the greatest risk for suicide. Around 90% of those who die by suicide have a diagnosis of at leastone mental disorder, with mood disorders being the most frequent (Fleischman, Bertolote, Belfer, & Beautrais,2005). In fact, the association between major depressive disorder and suicide is so strong that one of thecriteria for the disorder is thoughts of suicide, as discussed above (APA, 2013).Suicide rates can be difficult to interpret because some deaths that appear to be accidental may in fact be actsof suicide (e.g., automobile crash). Nevertheless, investigations into U.S. suicide rates have uncovered thesefacts:\u2022 Suicide was the 10th leading cause of death for all ages in 2010 (Centers for Disease Control andPrevention [CDC], 2012).\u2022 There were 38,364 suicides in 2010 in the United States\u2014an average of 105 each day (CDC, 2012).\u2022 Suicide among males is 4 times higher than among females and accounts for 79% of all suicides; firearms"

Since 2001,however, suicide rates among those ages 25\u201364 have risen consistently, and, since 2006, suicide rateshave been greater for those ages 65 and older (CDC, 2013b). This increase in suicide rates among middle-aged Americans has prompted concern in some quarters that baby boomers (individuals born between1946\u20131964) who face economic worry and easy access to prescription medication may be particularlyvulnerable to suicide (Parker-Pope, 2013).\u2022 The highest rates of suicide within the United States are among American Indians/Alaskan natives andNon-Hispanic White people (CDC, 2013b).\u2022 Suicide rates vary across the United States, with the highest rates consistently found in the mountainstates of the west (Alaska, Montana, Nevada, Wyoming, Colorado, and Idaho) (Berman, 2009).Contrary to popular belief, suicide rates peak during the springtime (April and May), not during the holidayseason or winter. In fact, suicide rates are generally lowest during the winter months (Postolache et al., 2010).Risk Factors For SuicideSuicidal risk is especially high among people with substance use problems. Individuals with alcoholdependence are at 10 times greater risk for suicide than the general population (Wilcox, Conner, & Caine,2004). The risk of suicidal behavior is especially high among those who have made a prior suicide attempt.Among those who attempt suicide, 16% make another attempt within a year and over 21% make anotherattempt within four years (Owens, Horrocks, & House, 2002). Suicidal individuals may be at high risk forterminating their life if they have a lethal means in which to act, such as a firearm in the home (Brent & Bridge,2003). Withdrawal from social relationships, feeling as though one is a burden to others, and engaging inreckless and risk-taking behaviors may be precursors to suicidal behavior (Berman, 2009). A sense ofentrapment or feeling unable to escape one\u2019s miserable feelings or external circumstances (e.g., an abusiverelationship with no perceived way out) predicts suicidal behavior (O\u2019Connor, Smyth, Ferguson, Ryan, &Williams, 2013). Tragically, reports of suicides among adolescents following instances of cyberbullying haveemerged in recent years. In one widely-publicized case a few years ago, Phoebe Prince, a 15-year-oldMassachusetts high school student, died by suicide following incessant harassment and taunting from herclassmates via texting and Facebook (McCabe, 2010).Suicides can have a contagious effect on people. For example, another\u2019s suicide, especially that of a familymember, heightens one\u2019s risk of suicide (Agerbo, Nordentoft, & Mortensen, 2002). Additionally, widely-publicized suicides tend to trigger additional suicides in some individuals. One study examining suicidestatistics in the United States from 1947\u20131967 found that the rates of suicide increased significantly for thefirst month after a report about suicide was printed on the front page of the New York Times(Phillips, 1974).Austrian researchers found a significant increase in the number of suicides by firearms in the three weeksfollowing extensive reports in Austria\u2019s largest newspaper of a celebrity suicide by gun (Etzersdorfer, Voracek,& Sonneck, 2004). A review of 42 studies concluded that media coverage of celebrity suicides is more than 14times more likely to trigger copycat suicides than is coverage of non-celebrity suicides (Stack, 2000). Thisreview also demonstrated that the medium of coverage is important: televised stories are considerably lesslikely to prompt a surge in suicides than are newspaper stories. Research suggests that a trend appears to beemerging whereby people use online social media to leave suicide notes, although it is not clear to what extentsuicide notes on such media might induce subsequent suicides (Ruder, Hatch, Ampanozi, Thali, & Fischer,2011). Nevertheless, it is reasonable to conjecture that suicide notes left by individuals on social media mayinfluence the decisions of other vulnerable people who encounter them (Luxton, June, & Fairall, 2012).One possible contributing factor in suicide is brain chemistry. Contemporary neurological research shows thatdisturbances in the functioning of serotonin are linked to suicidal behavior (Pompili et al., 2010). Low levels ofserotonin predict future suicide attempts and death by suicide, and low levels have been observed post-"

Serotonin dysfunction, as noted earlier, is also known to play animportant role in depression; low levels of serotonin have also been linked to aggression and impulsivity(Stanley et al., 2000). The combination of these three characteristics constitutes a potential formula forsuicide\u2014especially violent suicide. A classic study conducted during the 1970s found that patients with majordepressive disorder who had very low levels of serotonin attempted suicide more frequently and moreviolently than did patients with higher levels (Asberg, Thor\u00e9n, Tr\u00e4skman, Bertilsson, & Ringberger, 1976;Mann, 2003).Suicidal thoughts, plans, and even off-hand remarks (\u201cI might kill myself this afternoon\u201d) should always betaken extremely seriously.

About 1% of the population experiences schizophrenia in their lifetime, and usually thedisorder is first diagnosed during early adulthood (early to mid-20s). Most people with schizophreniaexperience significant difficulties in many day-to-day activities, such as holding a job, paying bills, caring foroneself (grooming and hygiene), and maintaining relationships with others. Frequent hospitalizations aremore often the rule rather than the exception with schizophrenia. Even when they receive the best treatmentsavailable, many with schizophrenia will continue to experience serious social and occupational impairmentthroughout their lives.What is schizophrenia? First, schizophrenia is nota condition involving a split personality; that is,schizophrenia is not the same thing as dissociative identity disorder (better known as multiple personalitydisorder). These disorders are sometimes confused because the word schizophreniafirst coined by the Swisspsychiatrist Eugen Bleuler in 1911, derives from Greek words that refer to a \u201csplitting\u201d (schizo) of psychicfunctions (phrene) (Green, 2001).Schizophrenia is considered a psychotic disorder, or one in which the person\u2019s thoughts, perceptions, andbehaviors are impaired to the point where they are not able to function normally in life. In informal terms, onewho suffers from a psychotic disorder (that is, has a psychosis) is disconnected from the world in which mostof us live.Symptoms of SchizophreniaThe main symptoms of schizophrenia include hallucinations, delusions, disorganized thinking, disorganizedor abnormal motor behavior, and negative symptoms (APA, 2013). A hallucination is a perceptual experiencethat occurs in the absence of external stimulation. Auditory hallucinations (hearing voices) occur in roughlytwo-thirds of patients with schizophrenia and are by far the most common form of hallucination (Andreasen,1987). The voices may be familiar or unfamiliar, they may have a conversation or argue, or the voices mayprovide a running commentary on the person\u2019s behavior (Tsuang, Farone, & Green, 1999)."

A person with schizophrenia may believe that their mother is plotting with the FBI to poison theircoffee, or that their neighbor is an enemy spy who wants to kill them. These kinds of delusions are known asparanoid delusions, which involve the (false) belief that other people or agencies are plotting to harm theperson. People with schizophrenia also may hold grandiose delusions, beliefs that one holds special power,unique knowledge, or is extremely important. For example, the person who claims to be Jesus Christ, or whoclaims to have knowledge going back 5,000 years, or who claims to be a great philosopher is experiencinggrandiose delusions. Other delusions include the belief that one\u2019s thoughts are being removed (thoughtwithdrawal) or thoughts have been placed inside one\u2019s head (thought insertion). Another type of delusion issomatic delusion, which is the belief that something highly abnormal is happening to one\u2019s body (e.g., thatone\u2019s kidneys are being eaten by cockroaches).Disorganized thinking refers to disjointed and incoherent thought processes\u2014usually detected by what aperson says. The person might ramble, exhibit loose associations (jump from topic to topic), or talk in a waythat is so disorganized and incomprehensible that it seems as though the person is randomly combiningwords. Disorganized thinking is also exhibited by blatantly illogical remarks (e.g., \u201cFenway Park is in Boston. Ilive in Boston. Therefore, I live at Fenway Park.\u201d) and by tangentiality: responding to others\u2019 statements orquestions by remarks that are either barely related or unrelated to what was said or asked. For example, if aperson diagnosed with schizophrenia is asked if they are interested in receiving special job training, theymight state that they once rode on a train somewhere. To a person with schizophrenia, the tangential (slightlyrelated) connection between job trainingand riding a trainare sufficient enough to cause such a response.Disorganized or abnormal motor behavior refers to unusual behaviors and movements: becoming unusuallyactive, exhibiting silly child-like behaviors (giggling and self-absorbed smiling), engaging in repeated andpurposeless movements, or displaying odd facial expressions and gestures. In some cases, the person willexhibit catatonic behaviors, which show decreased reactivity to the environment, such as posturing, in whichthe person maintains a rigid and bizarre posture for long periods of time, or catatonic stupor, a complete lackof movement and verbal behavior.Negative symptoms are those that reflect noticeable decreases and absences in certain behaviors, emotions,or drives (Green, 2001). A person who exhibits diminished emotional expression shows no emotion in theirfacial expressions, speech, or movements, even when such expressions are normal or expected. Avolition ischaracterized by a lack of motivation to engage in self-initiated and meaningful activity, including the mostbasic of tasks, such as bathing and grooming. Alogia refers to reduced speech output; in simple terms, patientsdo not say much. Another negative symptom is asociality, or social withdrawal and lack of interest in engagingin social interactions with others. A final negative symptom, anhedonia, refers to an inability to experiencepleasure. One who exhibits anhedonia expresses little interest in what most people consider to be pleasurableactivities, such as hobbies, recreation, or sexual activity.LINK TO LEARNINGWatch this video of schizophrenia case studies (http://openstax.org/l/Schizo1) and try to identify which classicsymptoms of schizophrenia are shown.Causes of SchizophreniaThere is considerable evidence suggesting that schizophrenia has a genetic basis.

This is because family members who are closely related (such as siblings)are more likely to share similar environments than are family members who are less closely related (such ascousins); further, identical twins may be more likely to be treated similarly by others than might fraternaltwins. Thus, family and twin studies cannot completely rule out the possible effects of shared environmentsand experiences. Such problems can be corrected by using adoption studies, in which children are separatedfrom their parents at an early age. One of the first adoption studies of schizophrenia conducted by Heston(1966) followed 97 adoptees, including 47 who were born to mothers with schizophrenia, over a 36-yearperiod. Five of the 47 adoptees (11%) whose mothers had schizophrenia were later diagnosed withschizophrenia, compared to none of the 50 control adoptees. Other adoption studies have consistentlyreported that for adoptees who are later diagnosed with schizophrenia, their biological relatives have a higherrisk of schizophrenia than do adoptive relatives (Shih, Belmonte, & Zandi, 2004).Although adoption studies have supported the hypothesis that genetic factors contribute to schizophrenia,they have also demonstrated that the disorder most likely arises from a combination of genetic andenvironmental factors, rather than just genes themselves. For example, investigators in one study examinedthe rates of schizophrenia among 303 adoptees (Tienari et al., 2004). A total of 145 of the adoptees hadbiological mothers with schizophrenia; these adoptees constituted the high genetic risk group. The other 158adoptees had mothers with no psychiatric history; these adoptees composed the low genetic risk group. Theresearchers managed to determine whether the adoptees\u2019 families were either healthy or disturbed. Forexample, the adoptees were considered to be raised in a disturbed family environment if the family exhibited alot of criticism, conflict, and a lack of problem-solving skills. The findings revealed that adoptees whosebiological mothers had schizophrenia (high genetic risk) andwho had been raised in a disturbed familyenvironment were much more likely to develop schizophrenia or another psychotic disorder (36.8%) thanwere adoptees whose biological mothers had schizophrenia but who had been raised in a healthy environment(5.8%), or than adoptees with a low genetic risk who were raised in either a disturbed (5.3%) or healthy (4.8%)environment. Because the adoptees who were at high genetic risk were likely to develop schizophrenia onlyifthey were raised in a disturbed home environment, this study supports a diathesis-stress interpretation ofschizophrenia\u2014both genetic vulnerability and environmental stress are necessary for schizophrenia todevelop, genes alone do not show the complete picture.NeurotransmittersIf we accept that schizophrenia is at least partly genetic in origin, as it seems to be, it makes sense that the nextstep should be to identify biological abnormalities commonly found in people with the disorder. Perhaps notsurprisingly, a number of neurobiological factors have indeed been found to be related to schizophrenia. Onesuch factor that has received considerable attention for many years is the neurotransmitter dopamine. Interestin the role of dopamine in schizophrenia was stimulated by two sets of findings: drugs that increase dopaminelevels can produce schizophrenia-like symptoms, and medications that block dopamine activity reduce thesymptoms (Howes & Kapur, 2009). The dopamine hypothesis of schizophrenia proposed that anoverabundance of dopamine or too many dopamine receptors are responsible for the onset and maintenanceof schizophrenia (Snyder, 1976). More recent work in this area suggests that abnormalities in dopamine varyby brain region and thus contribute to symptoms in unique ways. In general, this research has suggested thatan overabundance of dopamine in the limbic system may be responsible for some symptoms, such ashallucinations and delusions, whereas low levels of dopamine in the prefrontal cortex might be responsibleprimarily for the negative symptoms (avolition, alogia, asociality, and anhedonia) (Davis, Kahn, Ko, & Davidson,1991). In recent years, serotonin has received attention, and newer antipsychotic medications used to treat thedisorder work by blocking serotonin receptors (Baumeister & Hawkins, 2004)."

This finding is important because larger than normalventricles suggests that various brain regions are reduced in size, thus implying that schizophrenia isassociated with a loss of brain tissue. In addition, many people with schizophrenia display a reduction in graymatter (cell bodies of neurons) in the frontal lobes (Lawrie & Abukmeil, 1998), and many show less frontal lobeactivity when performing cognitive tasks (Buchsbaum et al., 1990). The frontal lobes are important in a varietyof complex cognitive functions, such as planning and executing behavior, attention, speech, movement, andproblem solving. Hence, abnormalities in this region provide merit in explaining why people withschizophrenia experience deficits in these of areas.Events During PregnancyWhy do people with schizophrenia have these brain abnormalities? A number of environmental factors thatcould impact normal brain development might be at fault. High rates of obstetric complications in the births ofchildren who later developed schizophrenia have been reported (Cannon, Jones, & Murray, 2002). In addition,people are at an increased risk for developing schizophrenia if their mother was exposed to influenza duringthe first trimester of pregnancy (Brown et al., 2004). Research has also suggested that a person\u2019s emotionalstress during pregnancy may increase the risk of schizophrenia in offspring. One study reported that the riskof schizophrenia is elevated substantially in offspring whose mothers experienced the death of a relativeduring the first trimester of pregnancy (Khashan et al., 2008).MarijuanaAnother variable that is linked to schizophrenia is marijuana use. Although a number of reports have shownthat individuals with schizophrenia are more likely to use marijuana than are individuals withoutschizophrenia (Thornicroft, 1990), such investigations cannot determine if marijuana use leads toschizophrenia, or vice versa. However, a number of longitudinal studies have suggested that marijuana use is,in fact, a risk factor for schizophrenia. A classic investigation of over 45,000 Swedish military personnel whowere followed up after 15 years found that those individuals who had reported using marijuana at least once bythe time they were conscripted (drafted) into the military were more than 2 times as likely to developschizophrenia during the ensuing 15 years than were those who reported never using marijuana; those whohad indicated using marijuana 50 or more times were 6 times as likely to develop schizophrenia (Andr\u00e9asson,Allbeck, Engstr\u00f6m, & Rydberg, 1987). More recently, a review of 35 longitudinal studies found a substantiallyincreased risk of schizophrenia and other psychotic disorders in people who had used marijuana, with thegreatest risk in the most frequent users (Moore et al., 2007). Other work has found that marijuana use isassociated with an onset of psychotic disorders at an earlier age (Large, Sharma, Compton, Slade, & Nielssen,2011). Overall, the available evidence seems to indicate that marijuana use plays a causal role in thedevelopment of schizophrenia, although it is important to point out that marijuana use is not an essential orsufficient risk factor as not all people with schizophrenia have used marijuana and the majority of marijuanausers do not develop schizophrenia (Casadio, Fernandes, Murray, & Di Forti, 2011). One plausibleinterpretation of the data is that early marijuana use may disrupt normal brain development during importantearly maturation periods in adolescence (Trezza, Cuomo, & Vanderschuren, 2008). Thus, early marijuana usemay set the stage for the development of schizophrenia and other psychotic disorders, especially amongindividuals with an established vulnerability (Casadio et al., 2011).Schizophrenia: Early Warning SignsEarly detection and treatment of conditions such as heart disease and cancer have improved survival ratesand quality of life for people who suffer from these conditions. A new approach involves identifying people whoshow minor symptoms of psychosis, such as unusual thought content, paranoia, odd communication,delusions, problems at school or work, and a decline in social functioning\u2014which are coined prodromal"

Furtherresearch will enable a more accurate prediction of those at greatest risk for developing schizophrenia, andthus to whom early intervention efforts should be directed.DIG DEEPERForensic PsychologyIn August 2013, 17-year-old Cody Metzker-Madsen attacked 5-year-old Dominic Elkins on his foster parents\u2019property. Believing that he was fighting goblins and that Dominic was the goblin commander, Metzker-Madsenbeat Dominic with a brick and then held him face down in a creek. Dr. Alan Goldstein, a clinical and forensicpsychologist, testified that Metzker-Madsen believed that the goblins he saw were real and was not aware that itwas Dominic at the time. He was found not guilty by reason of insanity and was not held legally responsible forDominic's death (Nelson, 2014). Cody was also found to be a danger to himself or others. He will be held in apsychiatric facility until he is judged to be no longer dangerous. This does not mean that he \"got away with\"anything. In fact, according to the American Psychiatric Association, individuals who are found not guilty byreason of insanity are often confined to psychiatric hospitals for as long or longer than they would have spent inprison for a conviction.Most people with mental illness are not violent. Only 3\u20135% of violent acts are committed by individualsdiagnosed with severe mental illness, whereas individuals with severe mental illnesses are more than ten timesas likely to be victims of crime (MentalHealth.gov, 2017). The psychologists who work with individuals such asMetzker-Madsen are part of the subdiscipline of forensic psychology. Forensic psychologists are involved inpsychological assessment and treatment of individuals involved with the legal system. They use their knowledgeof human behavior and mental illness to assist the judicial and legal system in making decisions in casesinvolving such issues as personal injury suits, workers' compensation, competency to stand trial, and pleas of notguilty by reason of insanity."

Most fugue episodes last only a few hours or days, but some can last longer. One study ofresidents in communities in upstate New York reported that about 1.8% experienced dissociative amnesia inthe previous year (Johnson, Cohen, Kasen, & Brook, 2006).Some have questioned the validity of dissociative amnesia (Pope, Hudson, Bodkin, & Oliva, 1998); it has evenbeen characterized as a \u201cpiece of psychiatric folklore devoid of convincing empirical support\u201d (McNally, 2003,p. 275). Notably, scientific publications regarding dissociative amnesia rose during the 1980s and reached apeak in the mid-1990s, followed by an equally sharp decline by 2003; in fact, only 13 cases of individuals withdissociative amnesia worldwide could be found in the literature that same year (Pope, Barry, Bodkin, &Hudson, 2006). Further, no description of individuals showing dissociative amnesia following a trauma existsin any fictional or nonfictional work prior to 1800 (Pope, Poliakoff, Parker, Boynes, & Hudson, 2006). However,a study of 82 individuals who enrolled for treatment at a psychiatric outpatient hospital found that nearly 10%met the criteria for dissociative amnesia, perhaps suggesting that the condition is underdiagnosed, especiallyin psychiatric populations (Foote, Smolin, Kaplan, Legatt, & Lipschitz, 2006).Depersonalization/Derealization DisorderDepersonalization/derealization disorder is characterized by recurring episodes of depersonalization,derealization, or both. Depersonalization is defined as feelings of \u201cunreality or detachment from, orunfamiliarity with, one\u2019s whole self or from aspects of the self\u201d (APA, 2013, p. 302). Individuals who experiencedepersonalization might believe their thoughts and feelings are not their own; they may feel robotic as thoughthey lack control over their movements and speech; they may experience a distorted sense of time and, inextreme cases, they may sense an \u201cout-of-body\u201d experience in which they see themselves from the vantagepoint of another person. Derealization is conceptualized as a sense of \u201cunreality or detachment from, orunfamiliarity with, the world, be it individuals, inanimate objects, or all surroundings\u201d (APA, 2013, p. 303). Aperson who experiences derealization might feel as though they are in a fog or a dream, or that thesurrounding world is somehow artificial and unreal. Individuals with depersonalization/derealization disorderoften have difficulty describing their symptoms and may think they are going crazy (APA, 2013).Dissociative Identity DisorderBy far, the most well-known dissociative disorder is dissociative identity disorder (formerly called multiplepersonality disorder). People with dissociative identity disorder exhibit two or more separate personalities oridentities, each well-defined and distinct from one another. They also experience memory gaps for the timeduring which another identity is in charge (e.g., one might find unfamiliar items in their shopping bags oramong their possessions), and in some cases may report hearing voices, such as a child\u2019s voice or the sound ofsomebody crying (APA, 2013). The study of upstate New York residents mentioned above (Johnson et al., 2006)reported that 1.5% of their sample experienced symptoms consistent with dissociative identity disorder in theprevious year.Dissociative identity disorder (DID) is highly controversial. Some believe that people fake symptoms to avoidthe consequences of illegal actions (e.g., \u201cI am not responsible for shoplifting because it was my otherpersonality\u201d). In fact, it has been demonstrated that people are generally skilled at adopting the role of aperson with different personalities when they believe it might be advantageous to do so. As an example,Kenneth Bianchi was an infamous serial killer who, along with his cousin, murdered over a dozen girls andwomen around Los Angeles in the late 1970s. Eventually, he and his cousin were apprehended. At Bianchi\u2019strial, he pled not guilty by reason of insanity, presenting himself as though he had DID and claiming that adifferent personality (\u201cSteve Walker\u201d) committed the murders. When these claims were scrutinized, headmitted faking the symptoms and was found guilty (Schwartz, 1981).A second reason DID is controversial is because rates of the disorder suddenly skyrocketed in the 1980s.

Although this increase may be due to the development of moresophisticated diagnostic techniques, it is also possible that the popularization of DID\u2014helped in part by Sybil, apopular 1970s book (and later film) about a woman with 16 different personalities\u2014may have promptedclinicians to overdiagnose the disorder (Piper & Merskey, 2004). Casting further scrutiny on the existence ofmultiple personalities or identities is the recent suggestion that the story of Sybil was largely fabricated, andthe idea for the book might have been exaggerated (Nathan, 2011).Despite its controversial nature, DID is clearly a legitimate and serious disorder, and although some peoplemay fake symptoms, others suffer their entire lives with it. People with this disorder tend to report a history ofchildhood trauma, some cases having been corroborated through medical or legal records (Carde\u00f1a & Gleaves,2006). Research by Ross et al. (1990) suggests that in one study about 95% of people with DID were physicallyand/or sexually abused as children. Of course, not all reports of childhood abuse can be expected to be valid oraccurate. However, there is strong evidence that traumatic experiences can cause people to experience statesof dissociation, suggesting that dissociative states\u2014including the adoption of multiple personalities\u2014mayserve as a psychologically important coping mechanism for threat and danger (Dalenberg et al., 2012)."

However, there are a group of conditions that, when present, arediagnosed early in childhood, often before the time a child enters school. These conditions are listed in theDSM-5 as neurodevelopmental disorders, and they involve developmental problems in personal, social,academic, and intellectual functioning (APA, 2013). While they are often diagnosed in childhood, many peoplelive with them throughout adulthood. In this section, we will discuss two such disorders: attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder and autism.Attention Deficit/Hyperactivity DisorderDiego is always active, from the time he wakes up in the morning until the time he goes to bed at night. Hismother reports that he came out the womb kicking and screaming, and he has not stopped moving since. Hehas a sweet disposition, but always seems to be in trouble with his teachers, parents, and after-school programcounselors. He seems to accidentally break things; he lost his jacket three times last winter, and he neverseems to sit still. His teachers believe he is a smart child, but he never finishes anything he starts and is soimpulsive that he does not seem to learn much in school.Diego likely has attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). The symptoms of this disorder were firstdescribed by Hans Hoffman in the 1920s. While taking care of his son while his wife was in the hospital givingbirth to a second child, Hoffman noticed that the boy had trouble concentrating on his homework, had a shortattention span, and had to repeatedly go over easy homework to learn the material (Jellinek & Herzog, 1999).Later, it was discovered that many hyperactive children\u2014those who are fidgety, restless, socially disruptive,and have trouble with impulse control\u2014also display short attention spans, problems with concentration, anddistractibility. By the 1970s, it had become clear that many children who display attention problems often alsoexhibit signs of hyperactivity. In recognition of such findings, the DSM-III (published in 1980) included a newdisorder: attention deficit disorder with and without hyperactivity, now known as attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD).A child with ADHD shows a constant pattern of inattention and/or hyperactive and impulsive behavior thatinterferes with normal functioning (APA, 2013). Some of the signs of inattention include great difficulty with"

Hyperactivity is characterized by excessive movement, and includesfidgeting or squirming, leaving one\u2019s seat in situations when remaining seated is expected, having troublesitting still (e.g., in a restaurant), running about and climbing on things, blurting out responses before anotherperson\u2019s question or statement has been completed, difficulty waiting one\u2019s turn for something, andinterrupting and intruding on others. Frequently, the hyperactive child comes across as noisy and boisterous.The child\u2019s behavior is hasty, impulsive, and seems to occur without much forethought; these characteristicsmay explain why adolescents and young adults diagnosed with ADHD receive more traffic tickets and havemore automobile accidents than do others (Thompson, Molina, Pelham, & Gnagy, 2007).ADHD occurs in about 8% of children (Danielson et al, 2016), and studies estimate that for about 60% of thesepeople, ADHD continues into adulthood (Sibley et al 2016). On the average, boys are 3 times more likely to haveADHD than are girls; however, such findings might reflect the greater propensity of boys to engage inaggressive and antisocial behavior and thus incur a greater likelihood of being referred to psychological clinics(Barkley, 2006). Children with ADHD face severe academic and social challenges. Compared to their non-ADHD counterparts, children with ADHD have lower grades and standardized test scores and higher rates ofexpulsion, grade retention, and dropping out (Loe & Feldman, 2007). they also are less well-liked and moreoften rejected by their peers (Hoza et al., 2005).A recent study found that nearly 81% of those whose ADHD persisted into adulthood had experienced at leastone other comorbid disorder, compared to 47% of those whose ADHD did not persist (Barbaresi et al., 2013).Life Problems from ADHDChildren with ADHD face considerably worse long-term outcomes than do those children who do not haveADHD. Adults diagnosed with ADHD in childhood, but not treated for ADHD, have been reported to have pooroutcomes in a wide range of areas of life, including social function, education, criminality, alcohol use,substance use, and occupational outcomes (Arnold et al, 2015). In one investigation, 135 adults who had beenidentified as having ADHD symptoms in the 1970s were contacted decades later and interviewed (Klein et al.,2012). Compared to a control sample of 136 participants who had never been diagnosed with ADHD, those whowere diagnosed as children:\u2022 had worse educational attainment (more likely to have dropped out of high school and less likely to haveearned a bachelor\u2019s degree);\u2022 had lower socioeconomic status;\u2022 held less prestigious occupational positions;\u2022 were more likely to be unemployed;\u2022 made considerably less in salary;\u2022 scored worse on a measure of occupational functioning (indicating, for example, lower job satisfaction,poorer work relationships, and more firings);\u2022 scored worse on a measure of social functioning (indicating, for example, fewer friendships and lessinvolvement in social activities);\u2022 were more likely to be divorced; and\u2022 were more likely to have non-alcohol-related substance abuse problems. (Klein et al., 2012)Longitudinal studies also show that children diagnosed with ADHD are at higher risk for substance abuseproblems. One study reported that childhood ADHD predicted later drinking problems, daily smoking, and useof marijuana and other illicit drugs (Molina & Pelham, 2003). The risk of substance abuse problems appears tobe even greater for those with ADHD who also exhibit antisocial tendencies (Marshal & Molina, 2006).Diagnosis, treatment, and general awareness of ADHD has certainly improved in the decades since the people"

Studies that include more recent outcomes show positive effects oftreatment as opposed to non-treatment (Harpin, 2013; Arnold 2015). In most cases, the same studies indicatethat more research and work needs to be undertaken to understand the most effect treatments and theirimpacts.Causes of ADHDFamily and twin studies indicate that genetics play a significant role in the development of ADHD. Burt (2009),in a review of 26 studies, reported that the median rate of concordance for identical twins was .66 (one studyreported a rate of .90), whereas the median concordance rate for fraternal twins was .20. This study also foundthat the median concordance rate for unrelated (adoptive) siblings was .09; although this number is small, it isgreater than 0, thus suggesting that the environment may have at least some influence. Another review ofstudies concluded that the heritability of inattention and hyperactivity were 71% and 73%, respectively(Nikolas & Burt, 2010).The specific genes involved in ADHD are thought to include at least two that are important in the regulation ofthe neurotransmitter dopamine (Gizer, Ficks, & Waldman, 2009), suggesting that dopamine may be importantin ADHD. Indeed, medications used in the treatment of ADHD, such as methylphenidate (Ritalin) andamphetamine with dextroamphetamine (Adderall), have stimulant qualities and elevate dopamine activity.People with ADHD show less dopamine activity in key regions of the brain, especially those associated withmotivation and reward (Volkow et al., 2009), which provides support to the theory that dopamine deficits maybe a vital factor in the development this disorder (Swanson et al., 2007).Brain imaging studies have shown that children with ADHD exhibit abnormalities in their frontal lobes, an areain which dopamine is in abundance. Compared to children without ADHD, those with ADHD appear to havesmaller frontal lobe volume, and they show less frontal lobe activation when performing mental tasks. Recallthat one of the functions of the frontal lobes is to inhibit our behavior. Thus, abnormalities in this region maygo a long way toward explaining the hyperactive, uncontrolled behavior of ADHD.By the 1970s, many had become aware of the connection between nutritional factors and childhood behavior.At the time, much of the public believed that hyperactivity was caused by sugar and food additives, such asartificial coloring and flavoring. Undoubtedly, part of the appeal of this hypothesis was that it provided asimple explanation of (and treatment for) behavioral problems in children. A statistical review of 16 studies,however, concluded that sugar consumption has no effect at all on the behavioral and cognitive performance ofchildren (Wolraich, Wilson, & White, 1995). Additionally, although food additives have been shown to increasehyperactivity in non-ADHD children, the effect is rather small (McCann et al., 2007). Numerous studies,however, have shown a significant relationship between exposure to nicotine in cigarette smoke during theprenatal period and ADHD (Linnet et al., 2003). Maternal smoking during pregnancy is associated with thedevelopment of more severe symptoms of the disorder (Thakur et al., 2013).Is ADHD caused by poor parenting? No. Remember, the genetics studies discussed above suggested that thefamily environment does not seem to play much of a role in the development of this disorder; if it did, wewould expect the concordance rates to be higher for fraternal twins and adoptive siblings than has beendemonstrated. All things considered, the evidence seems to point to the conclusion that ADHD is triggeredmore by genetic and neurological factors and less by social or environmental ones.Why Is the Prevalence Rate of ADHD Increasing?Many people believe that the rates of ADHD have increased in recent years, and there is evidence to support thiscontention. In a recent study, investigators found that the parent-reported prevalence of ADHD among children(4\u201317 years old) in the United States increased by 22% during a 4-year period, from 7.8% in 2003 to 9.5% inDIG DEEPER"

Over time this increase in parent-reported ADHD was observed in all sociodemographicgroups and was reflected by substantial increases in 12 states (Indiana, North Carolina, and Colorado were thetop three). The increases were greatest for older teens (ages 15\u201317), multiracial and Hispanic children, andchildren with a primary language other than English. Another investigation found that from 1998\u20132000 through2007\u20132009 the parent-reported prevalence of ADHD increased among U.S. children between the ages of 5\u201317years old, from 6.9% to 9.0% (Akinbami, Liu, Pastor, & Reuben, 2011).A major weakness of both studies was that children were not actually given a formal diagnosis. Instead, parentswere simply asked whether or not a doctor or other health-care provider had ever told them their child hadADHD; the reported prevalence rates thus may have been affected by the accuracy of parental memory.Nevertheless, the findings from these studies raise important questions concerning what appears to be ademonstrable rise in the prevalence of ADHD. Although the reasons underlying this apparent increase in therates of ADHD over time are poorly understood and, at best, speculative, several explanations are viable:\u2022 ADHD may be over-diagnosed by doctors who are too quick to medicate children as a behavior treatment.\u2022 There is greater awareness of ADHD now than in the past. Nearly everyone has heard of ADHD, and mostparents and teachers are aware of its key symptoms. Thus, parents may be quick to take their children to adoctor if they believe their child possesses these symptoms, or teachers may be more likely now than in thepast to notice the symptoms and refer the child for evaluation.\u2022 The use of computers, video games, iPhones, and other electronic devices has become pervasive amongchildren in the early 21st century, and these devices could potentially shorten children\u2019s attentions spans.Thus, what might seem like inattention to some parents and teachers could simply reflect exposure to toomuch technology.\u2022 ADHD diagnostic criteria have changed over time.Autism Spectrum DisorderA seminal paper published in 1943 by psychiatrist Leo Kanner described an unusual neurodevelopmentalcondition he observed in a group of children. He called this condition early infantile autism, and it wascharacterized mainly by an inability to form close emotional ties with others, speech and languageabnormalities, repetitive behaviors, and an intolerance of minor changes in the environment and in normalroutines (Bregman, 2005). What the DSM-5 refers to as autism spectrum disorder today, is a direct extensionof Kanner\u2019s work.Autism spectrum disorder is probably the most misunderstood of the neurodevelopmental disorders. Childrenwith this disorder show signs of significant disturbances in three main areas: (a) deficits in social interaction,(b) deficits in communication, and (c) repetitive patterns of behavior or interests. These disturbances appearearly in life and cause serious impairments in functioning (APA, 2013). The child with autism spectrumdisorder might exhibit deficits in social interaction by not initiating conversations with other children orturning their head away when spoken to.

In some cases, it is almost as though these individualslive in a personal and isolated social world others are simply not privy to or able to penetrate.

In some cases, theperson with autism spectrum disorder might show highly restricted and fixated interests that appear to beabnormal in their intensity. For instance, the person might learn and memorize every detail about somethingeven though doing so serves no apparent purpose. Importantly, autism spectrum disorder is not the samething as intellectual disability, although these two conditions are often comorbid. The DSM-5 specifies that thesymptoms of autism spectrum disorder are not caused or explained by intellectual disability.Life Problems From Autism Spectrum DisorderAutism spectrum disorder is referred to in everyday language as autism; in fact, the disorder was termed\u201cautistic disorder\u201d in earlier editions of the DSM, and its diagnostic criteria were much narrower than those ofautism spectrum disorder. The qualifier \u201cspectrum\u201d in autism spectrum disorder is used to indicate thatindividuals with the disorder can show a range, or spectrum, of symptoms that vary in their magnitude andseverity: some severe, others less severe. The previous edition of the DSM included a diagnosis of Asperger\u2019sdisorder, generally recognized as a less severe form of autistic disorder; individuals diagnosed with Asperger\u2019sdisorder were described as having average or high intelligence and a strong vocabulary, but exhibitingimpairments in social interaction and social communication, such as talking only about their special interests(Wing, Gould, & Gillberg, 2011). However, because research has failed to demonstrate that Asperger\u2019s disorderdiffers qualitatively from autistic disorder, the DSM-5 does not include it, which is prompting concerns amongsome parents that their children may no longer be eligible for special services (\u201cAsperger\u2019s SyndromeDropped,\u201d 2012). Some individuals with autism spectrum disorder, particularly those with better language andintellectual skills, can live and work independently as adults. However, most do not because the symptomsremain sufficient to cause serious impairment in many realms of life (APA, 2013).LINK TO LEARNINGWatch this video about early signs of autism (http://openstax.org/l/sevautism) to learn more.Current estimates from the Center for Disease Control and Prevention\u2019s Autism and Developmental DisabilitiesMonitoring Network indicate that 1 in 59 children in the United States has autism spectrum disorder; thedisorder is 4 times more common among boys (1 in 38) than in girls (1 in 152) (Baio et al, 2018). Rates ofautistic spectrum disorder have increased dramatically since the 1980s. For example, California saw anincrease of 273% in reported cases from 1987 through 1998 (Byrd, 2002); between 2000 and 2008, the rate ofautism diagnoses in the United States increased 78% (CDC, 2012). Although it is difficult to interpret thisincrease, it is possible that the rise in prevalence is the result of the broadening of the diagnosis, increasedefforts to identify cases in the community, and greater awareness and acceptance of the diagnosis. In addition,mental health professionals are now more knowledgeable about autism spectrum disorder and are betterequipped to make the diagnosis, even in subtle cases (Novella, 2008).Causes of Autism Spectrum DisorderThe exact causes of autism spectrum disorder remain unknown despite massive research efforts over the lasttwo decades (Meek, Lemery-Chalfant, Jahromi, & Valiente, 2013). Autism appears to be strongly influenced bygenetics, as identical twins show concordance rates of 60%\u201390%, whereas concordance rates for fraternaltwins and siblings are 5%\u201310% (Autism Genome Project Consortium, 2007). Many different genes and genemutations have been implicated in autism (Meek et al., 2013). Among the genes involved are those importantin the formation of synaptic circuits that facilitate communication between different areas of the brain(Gauthier et al., 2011). A number of environmental factors are also thought to be associated with increasedrisk for autism spectrum disorder, at least in part, because they contribute to new mutations. These factorsinclude exposure to pollutants, such as plant emissions and mercury, urban versus rural residence, andvitamin D deficiency (Kinney, Barch, Chayka, Napoleon, & Munir, 2009)."

These findings were very controversial and drewa great deal of attention, sparking an international forum on whether children should be vaccinated. In ashocking turn of events, some years later the article was retracted by the journal that had published it afterevidence of fraud and unethical practices on the part of the lead researcher. Despite the retraction, thereporting in popular media led to concerns about a possible link between vaccines and autism persisting. Arecent survey of parents, for example, found that roughly a third of respondents expressed such a concern(Kennedy, LaVail, Nowak, Basket, & Landry, 2011); and perhaps fearing that their children would developautism, more than 10% of parents of young children refuse or delay vaccinations (Dempsey et al., 2011). Someparents of children with autism mounted a campaign against scientists who refuted the vaccine-autism link.Even politicians and several well-known celebrities weighed in; for example, actress Jenny McCarthy (whobelieved that a vaccination caused her son\u2019s autism) co-authored a book on the matter. However, there is noscientific evidence that a link exists between autism and vaccinations (Hughes, 2007). Indeed, a recent studycompared the vaccination histories of 256 children with autism spectrum disorder with that of 752 controlchildren across three time periods during their first two years of life (birth to 3 months, birth to 7 months, andbirth to 2 years) (DeStefano, Price, & Weintraub, 2013). At the time of the study, the children were between 6and 13 years old, and their prior vaccination records were obtained. Because vaccines contain immunogens(substances that fight infections), the investigators examined medical records to see how many immunogenschildren received to determine if those children who received more immunogens were at greater risk fordeveloping autism spectrum disorder. The results of this study, a portion of which are shown in Figure 15.19,clearly demonstrate that the quantity of immunogens from vaccines received during the first two years of lifewere not at all related to the development of autism spectrum disorder. There is not a relationship betweenvaccinations and autism spectrum disorders.FIGURE 15.19 In terms of their exposure to immunogens in vaccines, overall, there is not a significant differencebetween children with autism spectrum disorder and their age-matched controls without the disorder (DeStefano etal., 2013).Why does concern over vaccines and autism spectrum disorder persist? Since the proliferation of the Internetin the 1990s, parents have been constantly bombarded with online information that can become magnifiedand take on a life of its own.

Notably, the study that fueled the controversy reported that 8out of 12 children\u2014according to their parents\u2014developed symptoms consistent with autism spectrumdisorder shortly after receiving a vaccination. To conclude that vaccines cause autism spectrum disorder onthis basis, as many did, is clearly incorrect for a number of reasons, not the least of which is becausecorrelation does not imply causation, as you\u2019ve learned.Additionally, as was the case with diet and ADHD in the 1970s, the notion that autism spectrum disorder iscaused by vaccinations is appealing to some because it provides a simple explanation for this condition. Likeall disorders, however, there are no simple explanations for autism spectrum disorder. Although the researchdiscussed above has shed some light on its causes, science is still a long way from complete understanding ofthe disorder."

People with personality disorders exhibit a personality style that differsmarkedly from the expectations of their culture, is pervasive and inflexible, begins in adolescence or earlyadulthood, and causes distress or impairment (APA, 2013). Generally, individuals with these disorders exhibitenduring personality styles that are extremely troubling and often create problems for them and those withwhom they come into contact. Their maladaptive personality styles frequently bring them into conflict withothers, disrupt their ability to develop and maintain social relationships, and prevent them fromaccomplishing realistic life goals.The DSM-5 recognizes 10 personality disorders, organized into 3 different clusters. Cluster A disorders includeparanoid personality disorder, schizoid personality disorder, and schizotypal personality disorder. People withthese disorders display a personality style that is odd or eccentric. Cluster B disorders include antisocialpersonality disorder, histrionic personality disorder, narcissistic personality disorder, and borderlinepersonality disorder. People with these disorders usually are impulsive, overly dramatic, highly emotional, anderratic. Cluster C disorders include avoidant personality disorder, dependent personality disorder, andobsessive-compulsive personality disorder (which is not the same thing as obsessive-compulsive disorder).People with these disorders often appear to be nervous and fearful. Table 15.2 provides a description of eachof the DSM-5 personality disorders:DSM-5 Personality DisordersDescriptionClusterharbors a pervasive and unjustifiable suspiciousness and mistrust of others; reluctant toconfide in or become close to others; reads hidden demeaning or threatening meaninginto benign remarks or events; takes offense easily and bears grudges; not due toschizophrenia or other psychotic disordersADSM-5PersonalityDisorderParanoidTABLE 15.2"

Two of thesepersonality disorders, borderline personality disorder and antisocial personality disorder, are regarded bymany as especially problematic.Borderline Personality DisorderThe \u201cborderline\u201d in borderline personality disorder was originally coined in the late 1930s in an effort todescribe patients who appeared anxious, but were prone to brief psychotic experiences\u2014that is, patients whowere thought to be literally on the borderline between anxiety and psychosis (Freeman, Stone, Martin, &Reinecke, 2005). Today, borderline personality disorder has a completely different meaning. Borderlinepersonality disorder is characterized chiefly by instability in interpersonal relationships, self-image, andmood, as well as marked impulsivity (APA, 2013). People with borderline personality disorder cannot toleratethe thought of being alone and will make frantic efforts (including making suicidal gestures and engaging inself-mutilation) to avoid abandonment or separation (whether real or imagined). Their relationships areintense and unstable; for example, a romantic partner may be idealized early in a relationship, but then latervilified at the slightest sign they appear to no longer show interest. These individuals have an unstable view ofself and, thus, might suddenly display a shift in personal attitudes, interests, career plans, and choice offriends. For example, a law school student may, despite having invested tens of thousands of dollars towardearning a law degree and despite having performed well in the program, consider dropping out and pursuing acareer in another field. People with borderline personality disorder may be highly impulsive and may engagein reckless and self-destructive behaviors such as excessive gambling, spending money irresponsibly,substance abuse, engaging in unsafe sex, and reckless driving. They sometimes show intense andinappropriate anger that they have difficulty controlling, and they can be moody, sarcastic, bitter, and verballyabusive.The prevalence of borderline personality disorder in the U.S. population is estimated to be around 1.4%(Lezenweger et al., 2007), but the rates are higher among those who use mental health services; approximately10% of mental health outpatients and 20% of psychiatric inpatients meet the criteria for diagnosis (APA,2013). Additionally, borderline personality disorder is comorbid with anxiety, mood, and substance usedisorders (Lezenweger et al., 2007).Biological Basis for Borderline Personality DisorderGenetic factors appear to be important in the development of borderline personality disorder. For example,core personality traits that characterize this disorder, such as impulsivity and emotional instability, show ahigh degree of heritability (Livesley, 2008). Also, the rates of borderline personality disorder among relatives ofpeople with this disorder have been found to be as high as 24.9% (White, Gunderson, Zanarani, & Hudson,2003). Individuals with borderline personality disorder report experiencing childhood physical, sexual, and/oremotional abuse at rates far greater than those observed in the general population (Afifi et al., 2010), indicatingthat environmental factors are also crucial. These findings would suggest that borderline personality disordermay be determined by an interaction between genetic factors and adverse environmental experiences.Consistent with this hypothesis, one study found that the highest rates of borderline personality disorder wereamong individuals with a borderline temperament (characterized by high novelty seeking and high harm-avoidance) and those who experienced childhood abuse and/or neglect (Joyce et al., 2003).Antisocial Personality DisorderMost human beings live in accordance with a moral compass, a sense of right and wrong. Most individualslearn at a very young age that there are certain things that should not be done. We learn that we should not lieor cheat. We are taught that it is wrong to take things that do not belong to us, and that it is wrong to exploitothers for personal gain. We also learn the importance of living up to our responsibilities, of doing what we saywe will do. People with antisocial personality disorder, however, do not seem to have a moral compass. Theseindividuals act as though they neither have a sense of nor care about right or wrong. Not surprisingly, these"

This lack of regard is exhibited a number of ways and can include repeatedlyperforming illegal acts, lying to or conning others, impulsivity and recklessness, irritability and aggressivenesstoward others, and failure to act in a responsible way (e.g., leaving debts unpaid) (APA, 2013). People with thisdisorder have no remorse over their misdeeds; these people will hurt, manipulate, exploit, and abuse othersand not feel any guilt. Signs of this disorder can emerge early in life; however, a person must be at least 18years old to be diagnosed with antisocial personality disorder.People with antisocial personality disorder seem to view the world as self-serving and unkind. They seem tothink that they should use whatever means necessary to get by in life. They tend to view others not as living,thinking, feeling beings, but rather as pawns to be used or abused for a specific purpose. They often have anover-inflated sense of themselves and can appear extremely arrogant. They frequently display superficialcharm; for example, without really meaning it they might say exactly what they think another person wants tohear. They lack empathy: they are incapable of understanding the emotional point-of-view of others. Peoplewith this disorder may become involved in illegal enterprises, show cruelty toward others, leave their jobs withno plans to obtain another job, have multiple sexual partners, repeatedly get into fights with others, and showreckless disregard for themselves and others (e.g., repeated arrests for driving while intoxicated) (APA, 2013).The DSM-5 has included an alternative model for conceptualizing personality disorders based on the traitsidentified in the Five Factor Model of personality. This model addresses the level of personality functioningsuch as impairments in self (identity or self-direction) and interpersonal (empathy or intimacy) functioning. Inthe case of antisocial personality disorder, the DSM-5 identifies the predominant traits of antagonism (such asdisregard for others\u2019 needs, manipulative or deceitful behavior) and disinhibition (characterized byimpulsivity, irresponsibility, and risk-taking) (Harwood, Schade, Krueger, Wright, & Markon, 2012). Apsychopathology specifier is also included that emphasizes traits such as attention seeking and lowanxiousness (lack of concern about negative consequences for risky or harmful behavior) (Crego & Widiger,2014).Risk Factors for Antisocial Personality DisorderAntisocial personality disorder is observed in about 3.6% of the population; the disorder is much morecommon among men, with a 3 to 1 ratio of men to women, and it is more likely to occur in men who areyounger, widowed, separated, divorced, of lower socioeconomic status, who live in urban areas, and who live inthe western United States (Compton, Conway, Stinson, Colliver, & Grant, 2005). Compared to men withantisocial personality disorder, women with the disorder are more likely to have experienced emotionalneglect and sexual abuse during childhood, and they are more likely to have had parents who abusedsubstances and who engaged in antisocial behaviors themselves (Alegria et al., 2013).Table 15.3 shows some of the differences in the specific types of antisocial behaviors that men and womenwith antisocial personality disorder exhibit (Alegria et al., 2013)."

Personality and temperament dimensions that are related tothis disorder, including fearlessness, impulsive antisociality, and callousness, have a substantial geneticinfluence (Livesley & Jang, 2008). Adoption studies clearly demonstrate that the development of antisocialbehavior is determined by the interaction of genetic factors and adverse environmental circumstances (Rhee &Waldman, 2002). For example, one investigation found that adoptees of biological parents with antisocialpersonality disorder were more likely to exhibit adolescent and adult antisocial behaviors if they were raisedin adverse adoptive family environments (e.g., adoptive parents had marital problems, were divorced, useddrugs, and had legal problems) than if they were raised in a more normal adoptive environment (Cadoret,Yates, Ed, Woodworth, & Stewart, 1995).Researchers who are interested in the importance of environment in the development of antisocial personalitydisorder have directed their attention to such factors as the community, the structure and functioning of thefamily, and peer groups. Each of these factors influences the likelihood of antisocial behavior. One longitudinalinvestigation of more than 800 Seattle-area youth measured risk factors for violence at 10, 14, 16, and 18 yearsof age (Herrenkohl et al., 2000). The risk factors examined included those involving the family, peers, andcommunity. A portion of the findings from this study are provided in Figure 15.20."

Theseindividuals fail to show fear in response to environment cues that signal punishment, pain, or noxiousstimulation. For instance, they show less skin conductance (sweatiness on hands) in anticipation of electricshock than do people without antisocial tendencies (Hare, 1965). Skin conductance is controlled by thesympathetic nervous system and is used to assess autonomic nervous system functioning. When thesympathetic nervous system is active, people become aroused and anxious, and sweat gland activity increases.Thus, increased sweat gland activity, as assessed through skin conductance, is taken as a sign of arousal oranxiety. For those with antisocial personality disorder, a lack of skin conductance may indicate the presence ofcharacteristics such as emotional deficits and impulsivity that underlie the propensity for antisocial behaviorand negative social relationships (Fung et al., 2005).Another example showing that those with antisocial personality disorder fail to respond to environmental cuescomes from a recent study by Stuppy-Sullivan and Baskin-Sommers (2019).

        "data": "Psychological disorders are conditions characterized by abnormal thoughts, feelings, and behaviors. Althoughchallenging, it is essential for psychologists and mental health professionals to agree on what kinds of innerexperiences and behaviors constitute the presence of a psychological disorder. Inner experiences andbehaviors that are atypical or violate social norms could signify the presence of a disorder; however, each ofthese criteria alone is inadequate. Harmful dysfunction describes the view that psychological disorders resultfrom the inability of an internal mechanism to perform its natural function. Many of the features of harmfuldysfunction conceptualization have been incorporated in the APA\u2019s formal definition of psychologicaldisorders. According to this definition, the presence of a psychological disorder is signaled by significantdisturbances in thoughts, feelings, and behaviors; these disturbances must reflect some kind of dysfunction(biological, psychological, or developmental), must cause significant impairment in one\u2019s life, and must notreflect culturally expected reactions to certain life events."

        "data": "Psychopathology is very complex, involving a plethora of etiological theories and perspectives. For centuries,psychological disorders were viewed primarily from a supernatural perspective and thought to arise fromdivine forces or possession from spirits. Some cultures continue to hold this supernatural belief. Today, manywho study psychopathology view mental illness from a biological perspective, whereby psychological disordersare thought to result largely from faulty biological processes. Indeed, scientific advances over the last severaldecades have provided a better understanding of the genetic, neurological, hormonal, and biochemical basesof psychopathology. The psychological perspective, in contrast, emphasizes the importance of psychologicalfactors (e.g., stress and thoughts) and environmental factors in the development of psychological disorders. Acontemporary, promising approach is to view disorders as originating from an integration of biological andpsychosocial factors. The diathesis-stress model suggests that people with an underlying diathesis, orvulnerability, for a psychological disorder are more likely than those without the diathesis to develop thedisorder when faced with stressful events."

Genetic and neurobiological factors contribute to the development of ADHD, which can persistwell into adulthood and is often associated with poor long-term outcomes. The major features of autismspectrum disorder include deficits in social interaction and communication and repetitive movements orinterests. As with ADHD, genetic factors appear to play a prominent role in the development of autismspectrum disorder; exposure to environmental pollutants such as mercury have also been linked to thedevelopment of this disorder.

According to the U.S.Department of Health and Human Services (2017), 18.9% of U.S. adults experienced mental illness in 2017.For teens (ages 13\u201318), the rate is similar to that of adults, and for children ages 8\u201315, current estimatessuggest that approximately 13% experience mental illness in a given year (National Institute of Mental Health[NIMH], 2017).With many different treatment options available, approximately how many people receive mental healthtreatment per year? According to the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA),in 2017, 14.8% of adults received treatment for a mental health issue (NIMH, 2017). These percentages, shownin Figure 16.2, reflect the number of adults who received care in inpatient and outpatient settings and/or usedprescription medication for psychological disorders.FIGURE 16.2 The percentage of adults who received mental health treatment in 2004\u20132008 is shown. Adultsseeking treatment increased slightly from 2004 to 2008.Children and adolescents also receive mental health services. The Centers for Disease Control andPrevention's National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) found that approximately half(50.6%) of children with mental disorders had received treatment for their disorder within the past year(NIMH, n.d.). However, there were some differences between treatment rates by category of disorder (Figure16.3). For example, children with anxiety disorders were least likely to have received treatment in the pastyear, while children with ADHD or a conduct disorder were more likely to receive treatment. Can you think ofsome possible reasons for these differences in receiving treatment?"

Let\u2019s take a look at the history of mental health treatment from the past (with somequestionable approaches in light of modern understanding of mental illness) to where we are today.Treatment in the PastFor much of history, people with mental illness have been treated very poorly. It was believed that mentalillness was caused by demonic possession, witchcraft, or an angry god (Szasz, 1960). For example, in medievaltimes, abnormal behaviors were viewed as a sign that a person was possessed by demons. If someone wasconsidered to be possessed, there were several forms of treatment to release spirits from the individual. Themost common treatment was exorcism, often conducted by priests or other religious figures: Incantations andprayers were said over the person\u2019s body, and they may have been given some medicinal drinks. Another formof treatment for extreme cases of mental illness was trephining: A small hole was made in the afflictedindividual\u2019s skull to release spirits from the body. Most people treated in this manner died. In addition toexorcism and trephining, other practices involved execution or imprisonment of people with psychologicaldisorders. Still others were left to be homeless beggars. Generally speaking, most people who exhibited strangebehaviors were greatly misunderstood and treated cruelly. The prevailing theory of psychopathology in earlierhistory was the idea that mental illness was the result of demonic possession by either an evil spirit or an evilgod because early beliefs incorrectly attributed all unexplainable phenomena to deities deemed either good orevil.From the late 1400s to the late 1600s, a common belief perpetuated by some religious organizations was thatsome people made pacts with the devil and committed horrible acts, such as eating babies (Blumberg, 2007).These people were considered to be witches and were tried and condemned by courts\u2014they were often burnedat the stake. Worldwide, it is estimated that tens of thousands of mentally ill people were killed after beingaccused of being witches or under the influence of witchcraft (Hemphill, 1966)By the 18th century, people who were considered odd and unusual were placed in asylums (Figure 16.4).Asylums were the first institutions created for the specific purpose of housing people with psychologicaldisorders, but the focus was ostracizing them from society rather than treating their disorders. Often thesepeople were kept in windowless dungeons, beaten, chained to their beds, and had little to no contact withcaregivers."

Horrified by her findings,Dix began lobbying various state legislatures and the U.S. Congress for change (Tiffany, 1891). Her efforts ledto the creation of the first mental asylums in the United States."

She did this by relentlessly lobbying state legislaturesand Congress to set up and fund such institutions.Despite reformers\u2019 efforts, however, a typical asylum was filthy, offered very little treatment, and often keptpeople for decades. At Willard Psychiatric Center in upstate New York, for example, one treatment was tosubmerge patients in cold baths for long periods of time. Electroshock treatment was also used, and the waythe treatment was administered often broke patients\u2019 backs; in 1943, doctors at Willard administered 1,443shock treatments (Willard Psychiatric Center, 2009). (Electroshock is now called electroconvulsive treatment,and the therapy is still used, but with safeguards and under anesthesia. A brief application of electric stimulusis used to produce a generalized seizure. Controversy continues over its effectiveness versus the side effects.)Many of the wards and rooms were so cold that a glass of water would be frozen by morning (WillardPsychiatric Center, 2009). Willard\u2019s doors were not closed until 1995. Conditions like these remainedcommonplace until well into the 20th century.Starting in 1954 and gaining popularity in the 1960s, antipsychotic medications were introduced. Theseproved a tremendous help in controlling the symptoms of certain psychological disorders, such as psychosis.Psychosis was a common diagnosis of individuals in mental hospitals, and it was often evidenced by symptomslike hallucinations and delusions, indicating a loss of contact with reality. Then in 1963, Congress passed andJohn F. Kennedy signed the Mental Retardation Facilities and Community Mental Health Centers ConstructionAct, which provided federal support and funding for community mental health centers (National Institutes ofHealth, 2013). This legislation changed how mental health services were delivered in the United States. Itstarted the process of deinstitutionalization, the closing of large asylums, by providing for people to stay intheir communities and be treated locally. In 1955, there were 558,239 severely mentally ill patientsinstitutionalized at public hospitals (Torrey, 1997). By 1994, by percentage of the population, there were 92%fewer hospitalized individuals (Torrey, 1997).Mental Health Treatment TodayToday, there are community mental health centers across the nation. They are located in neighborhoods nearthe homes of clients, and they provide large numbers of people with mental health services of various kindsand for many kinds of problems. Unfortunately, part of what occurred with deinstitutionalization was thatthose released from institutions were supposed to go to newly created centers, but the system was not set upeffectively. Centers were underfunded, staff was not trained to handle severe illnesses such as schizophrenia,there was high staff burnout, and no provision was made for the other services people needed, such ashousing, food, and job training. Without these supports, those people released under deinstitutionalizationoften ended up homeless. Even today, a large portion of the homeless population is considered to be mentallyill (Figure 16.7). Statistics show that 26% of homeless adults living in shelters experience mental illness (U.S.Department of Housing and Urban Development [HUD], 2011)."

(b) Correctional institutions also report a high number of individuals living with mental illness. (credit a:modification of work by \"Carl Campbell\"/Flickr; credit b: modification of work by Bart Everson)Mental health issues are also significant concerns regarding those involved in the corrections system.According to a 2006 special report by the Bureau of Justice Statistics (BJS), approximately 705,600 adults withmental health issues were incarcerated in the state prison system, and another 78,800 were incarcerated inthe federal prison system. A further 479,000 were in local jails. According to the study, \u201cpeople with mentalillnesses are overrepresented in probation and parole populations at estimated rates ranging from two to fourtimes the general population\u201d (Prins & Draper, 2009, p. 23). The correctional system faces increasing burdensin managing and supporting people with mental health issues (Torrey et al., 2014). The incarcerationexperience itself exacerbates existing issues, triggers disturbances, or leads to long term effects such as PTSD,depression, or other disorders. While incarcerated, people are often subjected to or witness violence or sexualassault, face isolation from family, and endure other physical or emotional traumas (Edgemon & Clay-Warner,2019).Today, instead of asylums, there are psychiatric hospitals run by state governments and local communityhospitals focused on short-term care. In all types of hospitals, the emphasis is on short-term stays, with theaverage length of stay being less than two weeks and often only several days. This is partly due to the very highcost of psychiatric hospitalization, which can be about $800 to $1000 per night (Stensland, Watson, & Grazier,2012). Therefore, insurance coverage often limits the length of time a person can be hospitalized fortreatment. Usually individuals are hospitalized only if they are an imminent threat to themselves or others.LINK TO LEARNINGView this timeline that shows the history of mental institutions in the United States (http://openstax.org/l/timeline) to learn more.Most people who have mental illnesses are not hospitalized. If someone is feeling very depressed, complains ofhearing voices, or feels anxious all the time, they might seek psychological treatment. A friend, spouse, orparent might refer someone for treatment. The individual might go see their primary care physician first andthen be referred to a mental health practitioner.Some people seek treatment because they are involved with the state\u2019s child protective services\u2014that is, theirchildren have been removed from their care due to abuse or neglect. The parents might be referred topsychiatric or substance abuse facilities and the children would likely receive treatment for trauma. If theparents are interested in and capable of becoming better parents, the goal of treatment might be familyreunification. For other children whose parents are unable to change\u2014for example, the parent or parents whoare heavily addicted to drugs and refuse to enter treatment\u2014the goal of therapy might be to help the childrenadjust to foster care and/or adoption (Figure 16.8)."

(credit: modification of work by UNHCR Ukraine/Flickr)Some people seek therapy because the criminal justice system referred them or required them to go. For someindividuals, for example, attending weekly counseling sessions might be a condition of parole. If an individualis mandated to attend therapy, they are seeking services involuntarily. Involuntary treatment refers totherapy that is not the individual\u2019s choice. Other individuals might voluntarily seek treatment. Voluntarytreatment means the person chooses to attend therapy to obtain relief from symptoms.Psychological treatment can occur in a variety of places. An individual might go to a community mental healthcenter or a practitioner in private or community practice. A child might see a school counselor, schoolpsychologist, or school social worker. An incarcerated person might receive group therapy in prison. There aremany different types of treatment providers, and licensing requirements vary from state to state. Besidespsychologists and psychiatrists, there are clinical social workers, marriage and family therapists, and trainedreligious personnel who also perform counseling and therapy.A range of funding sources pay for mental health treatment: health insurance, government, and private pay. Inthe past, even when people had health insurance, the coverage would not always pay for mental healthservices. This changed with the Mental Health Parity and Addiction Equity Act of 2008, which requires grouphealth plans and insurers to make sure there is parity of mental health services (U.S. Department of Labor,n.d.). This means that co-pays, total number of visits, and deductibles for mental health and substance usetreatment need to be equal to and cannot be more restrictive or harsher than those for physical illnesses andmedical/surgical problems.Finding treatment sources is also not always easy: there may be limited options, especially in rural areas andlow-income urban areas; waiting lists; poor quality of care available for indigent patients; and financialobstacles such as co-pays, deductibles, and time off from work. Over 85% of the l,669 federally designatedmental health professional shortage areas are rural; often primary care physicians and law enforcement arethe first-line mental health providers (Ivey, Scheffler, & Zazzali, 1998), although they do not have thespecialized training of a mental health professional, who often would be better equipped to provide care.Availability, accessibility, and acceptability (the stigma attached to mental illness) are all problems in ruralareas. Approximately two-thirds of those with symptoms receive no care at all (U.S. Department of Health andHuman Services, 2005; Wagenfeld, Murray, Mohatt, & DeBruiynb, 1994). At the end of 2013, the U.S.Department of Agriculture announced an investment of $50 million to help improve access and treatment formental health problems as part of the Obama administration\u2019s effort to strengthen rural communities."

Psychotherapy is a psychologicaltreatment that employs various methods to help someone overcome personal problems, or to attain personalgrowth. In modern practice, it has evolved into what is known as psychodynamic therapy, which will bediscussed later. Biomedical therapy involves medication and/or medical procedures to treat psychologicaldisorders.

It was the dominanttherapeutic technique in the early 20th century, but it has since waned significantly in popularity. Freudbelieved most of our psychological problems are the result of repressed impulses and trauma experienced inchildhood, and he believed psychoanalysis would help uncover long-buried feelings. In a psychoanalyst\u2019soffice, you might see a patient lying on a couch speaking of dreams or childhood memories, and the therapistusing various Freudian methods such as free association and dream analysis (Figure 16.9). In freeassociation, the patient relaxes and then says whatever comes to mind at the moment. However, Freud feltthat the ego would at times try to block, or repress, unacceptable urges or painful conflicts during freeassociation. Consequently, a patient would demonstrate resistance to recalling these thoughts or situations. Indream analysis, a therapist interprets the underlying meaning of dreams.Psychoanalysis is a therapy approach that typically takes years. Over the course of time, the patient reveals agreat deal about himself to the therapist. Freud suggested that during this patient-therapist relationship, thepatient comes to develop strong feelings for the therapist\u2014maybe positive feelings, maybe negative feelings.Freud called this transference: the patient transfers all the positive or negative emotions associated with thepatient\u2019s other relationships to the psychoanalyst. For example, Crystal is seeing a psychoanalyst. During theyears of therapy, she comes to see her therapist as a father figure. She transfers her feelings about her fatheronto her therapist, perhaps in an effort to gain the love and attention she did not receive from her own father."

Today, psychotherapypatients are not likely to lie on a couch; instead they are more likely to sit facing the therapist (Prochaska &Norcross, 2010). (credit: Robert Huffstutter)Today, Freud\u2019s psychoanalytical perspective has been expanded upon by the developments of subsequenttheories and methodologies: the psychodynamic perspective. This approach to therapy remains centered onthe role of people\u2019s internal drives and forces, but treatment is less intensive than Freud\u2019s original model.LINK TO LEARNINGView a brief video overview of psychoanalysis theory, research, and practice (http://openstax.org/l/psycanalysis) to learn more.Psychotherapy: Play TherapyPlay therapy is often used with children since they are not likely to sit on a couch and recall their dreams orengage in traditional talk therapy. This technique uses a therapeutic process of play to \u201chelp clients prevent orresolve psychosocial difficulties and achieve optimal growth\u201d (O\u2019Connor, 2000, p. 7). The idea is that childrenplay out their hopes, fantasies, and traumas while using dolls, stuffed animals, and sandbox figurines (Figure16.10). Play therapy can also be used to help a therapist make a diagnosis. The therapist observes how thechild interacts with toys (e.g., dolls, animals, and home settings) in an effort to understand the roots of thechild\u2019s disturbed behavior. Play therapy can be nondirective or directive. In nondirective play therapy, childrenare encouraged to work through their problems by playing freely while the therapist observes (LeBlanc &Ritchie, 2001). In directive play therapy, the therapist provides more structure and guidance in the playsession by suggesting topics, asking questions, and even playing with the child (Harter, 1977).FIGURE 16.10 This type of play therapy is known as sandplay or sandtray therapy. Children can set up a three-dimensional world using various figures and objects that correspond to their inner state (Kalff, 1991).

Behavior therapy employs both classical and operant conditioning techniques tochange behavior.One type of behavior therapy utilizes classical conditioning techniques. Therapists using these techniquesbelieve that dysfunctional behaviors are conditioned responses. Applying the conditioning principlesdeveloped by Ivan Pavlov, these therapists seek to recondition their clients and thus change their behavior.Emmie is eight years old, and frequently wets her bed at night. She\u2019s been invited to several sleepovers, but shewon\u2019t go because of her problem. Using a type of conditioning therapy, Emmie begins to sleep on a liquid-sensitive bed pad that is hooked to an alarm. When moisture touches the pad, it sets off the alarm, waking upEmmie. When this process is repeated enough times, Emmie develops an association between urinaryrelaxation and waking up, and this stops the bedwetting. Emmie has now gone three weeks without wetting herbed and is looking forward to her first sleepover this weekend.One commonly used classical conditioning therapeutic technique is counterconditioning: a client learns anew response to a stimulus that has previously elicited an undesirable behavior. Two counterconditioningtechniques are aversive conditioning and exposure therapy. Aversive conditioning uses an unpleasantstimulus to stop an undesirable behavior. Therapists apply this technique to eliminate addictive behaviors,such as smoking, nail biting, and drinking. In aversion therapy, clients will typically engage in a specificbehavior (such as nail biting) and at the same time are exposed to something unpleasant, such as a mildelectric shock or a bad taste. After repeated associations between the unpleasant stimulus and the behavior,the client can learn to stop the unwanted behavior.Aversion therapy has been used effectively for years in the treatment of alcoholism (Davidson, 1974; Elkins,1991; Streeton & Whelan, 2001). One common way this occurs is through a chemically based substance knownas Antabuse. When a person takes Antabuse and then consumes alcohol, uncomfortable side effects resultincluding nausea, vomiting, increased heart rate, heart palpitations, severe headache, and shortness of breath.Antabuse is repeatedly paired with alcohol until the client associates alcohol with unpleasant feelings, whichdecreases the client\u2019s desire to consume alcohol. Antabuse creates a conditioned aversion to alcohol because itreplaces the original pleasure response with an unpleasant one.In exposure therapy, a therapist seeks to treat clients\u2019 fears or anxiety by presenting them with the object orsituation that causes their problem, with the idea that they will eventually get used to it. This can be done viareality, imagination, or virtual reality. Exposure therapy was first reported in 1924 by Mary Cover Jones, who isconsidered the mother of behavior therapy. Jones worked with a boy named Peter who was afraid of rabbits.Her goal was to replace Peter\u2019s fear of rabbits with a conditioned response of relaxation, which is a responsethat is incompatible with fear (Figure 16.11). How did she do it? Jones began by placing a caged rabbit on theother side of a room with Peter while he ate his afternoon snack. Over the course of several days, Jones movedthe rabbit closer and closer to where Peter was seated with his snack. After two months of being exposed to therabbit while relaxing with his snack, Peter was able to hold the rabbit and pet it while eating (Jones, 1924)."

This figure showsconditioning as conducted in Mary Cover Jones\u2019 1924 study.Thirty years later, Joseph Wolpe (1958) refined Jones\u2019s techniques, giving us systematic desensitization.Using this method, a person creates a hierarchy of anxiety, ranging from the least-anxiety-producing stimulusto the feared object. These activities are paired with relaxation techniques, which are taught to the clientbeforehand and used during the graduated exposures. The idea is that a person cannot be nervous and relaxedat the same time. Therefore, if they can learn to relax when they are facing environmental stimuli that makethem nervous or fearful, they can eventually eliminate the unwanted fear response. (Figure 16.12)."

Nothing bad has ever happened to him on an elevator, but he\u2019s soafraid of elevators that he will always take the stairs. That wasn\u2019t a problem when Jayden worked on the secondfloor of an office building, but now he has a new job\u2014on the 29th floor of a skyscraper in downtown LosAngeles. Jayden knows he can\u2019t climb 29 flights of stairs in order to get to work each day, so he decided to see abehavior therapist for help. The therapist asks Jayden to first construct a hierarchy of elevator-relatedsituations that elicit fear and anxiety. They range from situations of mild anxiety such as being nervous aroundthe other people in the elevator, to the fear of getting an arm caught in the door, to panic-provoking situationssuch as getting trapped or the cable snapping. Next, the therapist uses progressive relaxation. They teachJayden how to relax each of his muscle groups so that he achieves a drowsy, relaxed, and comfortable state ofmind. Once he\u2019s in this state, the therapist asks Jayden to imagine a mildly anxiety-provoking situation. Jaydenis standing in front of the elevator thinking about pressing the call button.If this scenario causes Jayden anxiety, he lifts his finger. The therapist would then tell Jayden to forget thescene and return to his relaxed state. They repeat this scenario over and over until Jayden can imagine himselfpressing the call button without anxiety. Over time the therapist and Jayden use progressive relaxation andimagination to proceed through all of the situations on Jayden\u2019s hierarchy until he becomes desensitized toeach one. After this, Jayden and the therapist begin to practice what he only previously envisioned in therapy,gradually going from pressing the button to actually riding an elevator. The goal is that Jayden will soon be ableto take the elevator all the way up to the 29th floor of his office without feeling any anxiety.Sometimes, it\u2019s too impractical, expensive, or embarrassing to re-create anxiety- producing situations, so atherapist might employ virtual reality exposure therapy by using a simulation to help conquer fears. Virtualreality exposure therapy has been used effectively to treat numerous anxiety disorders such as the fear ofpublic speaking, claustrophobia (fear of enclosed spaces), aviophobia (fear of flying), and post-traumatic stressdisorder (PTSD), a trauma and stressor-related disorder (Gerardi, Cukor, Difede, Rizzo, & Rothbaum, 2010).LINK TO LEARNINGA new virtual reality exposure therapy is being used to treat PTSD in soldiers. Virtual Iraq is a simulation thatmimics Middle Eastern cities and desert roads with situations similar to those soldiers experienced whiledeployed in Iraq.

This involves a controlled settingwhere individuals are reinforced for desirable behaviors with tokens, such as a poker chip, that can beexchanged for items or privileges. Token economies are often used in psychiatric hospitals to increase patientcooperation and activity levels. Patients are rewarded with tokens when they engage in positive behaviors (e.g.,making their beds, brushing their teeth, coming to the cafeteria on time, and socializing with other patients).They can later exchange the tokens for extra TV time, private rooms, visits to the canteen, and so on(Dickerson, Tenhula, & Green-Paden, 2005).Psychotherapy: Cognitive TherapyCognitive therapy is a form of psychotherapy that focuses on how a person\u2019s thoughts lead to feelings ofdistress. The idea behind cognitive therapy is that how you think determines how you feel and act. Cognitivetherapists help their clients change dysfunctional thoughts in order to relieve distress. They help a client seehow they misinterpret a situation (cognitive distortion). For example, a client may overgeneralize. Because aperson failed one test in Psychology 101, they feel stupid and worthless. These thoughts then cause their moodto worsen. Therapists also help clients recognize when they blow things out of proportion. Because Ray failedhis Psychology 101 test, he has concluded that he\u2019s going to fail the entire course and probably flunk out ofcollege altogether. These errors in thinking have contributed to Ray\u2019s feelings of distress. His therapist will helphim challenge these irrational beliefs, focus on their illogical basis, and correct them with more logical andrational thoughts and beliefs.Cognitive therapy was developed by psychiatrist Aaron Beck in the 1960s. His initial focus was on depressionand how a client\u2019s self-defeating attitude served to maintain a depression despite positive factors in her life(Beck, Rush, Shaw, & Emery, 1979) (Figure 16.13). Through questioning, a cognitive therapist can help a clientrecognize dysfunctional ideas, challenge catastrophizing thoughts about themselves and their situations, andfind a more positive way to view things (Beck, 2011).FIGURE 16.13 Your emotional reactions are the result of your thoughts about the situation rather than the situationitself. For instance, if you consistently interpret events and emotions around the themes of loss and defeat, then youare likely to be depressed. Through therapy, you can learn more logical ways to interpret situations.LINK TO LEARNINGView a brief video in which Judith Beck talks about cognitive therapy (http://openstax.org/l/JBeck) andconducts a session with a client.Psychotherapy: Cognitive-Behavioral TherapyCognitive-behavioral therapists focus much more on present issues than on a patient\u2019s childhood or past, as inother forms of psychotherapy.

Behaviorists such as Joseph Wolpe also influenced Ellis\u2019s therapeutic approach (NationalAssociation of Cognitive-Behavioral Therapists, 2009).Cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) helps clients examine how their thoughts affect their behavior. It aims tochange cognitive distortions and self-defeating behaviors. In essence, this approach is designed to change theway people think as well as how they act. It is similar to cognitive therapy in that CBT attempts to makeindividuals aware of their irrational and negative thoughts and helps people replace them with new, morepositive ways of thinking. It is also similar to behavior therapies in that CBT teaches people how to practice andengage in more positive and healthy approaches to daily situations. In total, hundreds of studies have shownthe effectiveness of cognitive-behavioral therapy in the treatment of numerous psychological disorders suchas depression, PTSD, anxiety disorders, eating disorders, bipolar disorder, and substance abuse (Beck Institutefor Cognitive Behavior Therapy, n.d.). For example, CBT has been found to be effective in decreasing levels ofhopelessness and suicidal thoughts in previously suicidal teenagers (Alavi, Sharifi, Ghanizadeh, & Dehbozorgi,2013). Cognitive-behavioral therapy has also been effective in reducing PTSD in specific populations, such astransit workers (Lowinger & Rombom, 2012).Cognitive-behavioral therapy aims to change cognitive distortions and self-defeating behaviors usingtechniques like the ABC model. With this model, there is an Action (sometimes called an activating event), theBelief about the event, and the Consequences of this belief. Let\u2019s say Jon and Joe both go to a party. Jon and Joeeach have met an interesting person at the party and spend a few hours chatting with them. At the end of theparty, Jon and Joe ask to exchange phone numbers with the person they've been talking to, and the request isrefused. Both Jon and Joe are surprised, as they thought things were going well. What can Jon and Joe tellthemselves about why the person was not interested? Let\u2019s say Jon tells himself he is a loser, or is ugly, or \u201chasno game.\u201d Jon then gets depressed and decides not to go to another party, which starts a cycle that keeps himdepressed. Joe tells himself that he had bad breath, goes out and buys a new toothbrush, goes to another party,and meets someone new.Jon\u2019s belief about what happened results in a consequence of further depression, whereas Joe\u2019s belief does not.Jon is internalizing the attribution or reason for the rebuffs, which triggers his depression. On the other hand,Joe is externalizing the cause, so his thinking does not contribute to feelings of depression. Cognitive-behavioral therapy examines specific maladaptive and automatic thoughts and cognitive distortions. Someexamples of cognitive distortions are all-or-nothing thinking, overgeneralization, and jumping to conclusions.In overgeneralization, someone takes a small situation and makes it huge\u2014for example, instead of saying,\u201cThis particular person was not interested in me,\u201d the man says, \u201cI am ugly, a loser, and no one is ever going tobe interested in me.\u201dAll or nothing thinking, which is a common type of cognitive distortion for people suffering from depression,reflects extremes. In other words, everything is black or white. After being turned down for a date, Jon beginsto think, \u201cNo woman will ever go out with me. I\u2019m going to be alone forever.\u201d He begins to feel anxious and sadas he contemplates his future.The third kind of distortion involves jumping to conclusions\u2014assuming that people are thinking negativelyabout you or reacting negatively to you, even though there is no evidence. Consider the example of Savannahand Hillaire, who recently met at a party. They have a lot in common, and Savannah thinks they could becomefriends. She calls Hillaire to invite her for coffee. Since Hillaire doesn\u2019t answer, Savannah leaves her a message.Several days go by and Savannah never hears back from her potential new friend. Maybe Hillaire neverreceived the message because she lost her phone or she is too busy to return the phone call. But if Savannahbelieves that Hillaire didn\u2019t like Savannah or didn\u2019t want to be her friend, she is demonstrating the cognitivedistortion of jumping to conclusions.How effective is CBT?

The treatments I have received, suchas taking antidepressants and psychodynamic counseling, have helped [me] to cope with thesymptoms and to get some insights into the roots of my problems. CBT has been by far the most usefulapproach I have found in tackling these mood problems. It has raised my awareness of how mythoughts impact on my moods. How the way I think about myself, about others and about the worldcan lead me into depression. It is a practical approach, which does not dwell so much on childhoodexperiences, whilst acknowledging that it was then that these patterns were learned. It looks at what ishappening now, and gives tools to manage these moods on a daily basis. (Martin, 2007, n.p.)Psychotherapy: Humanistic TherapyHumanistic psychology focuses on helping people achieve their potential. So it makes sense that the goal ofhumanistic therapy is to help people become more self-aware and accepting of themselves. In contrast topsychoanalysis, humanistic therapists focus on conscious rather than unconscious thoughts. They alsoemphasize the patient\u2019s present and future, as opposed to exploring the patient\u2019s past.Psychologist Carl Rogers developed a therapeutic orientation known as Rogerian, or client-centered therapy.Note the change from patientsto clients. Rogers (1951) felt that the term patient suggested the person seekinghelp was sick and looking for a cure. Since this is a form of nondirective therapy, a therapeutic approach inwhich the therapist does not give advice or provide interpretations but helps the person to identify conflictsand understand feelings, Rogers (1951) emphasized the importance of the person taking control of his own lifeto overcome life\u2019s challenges.In client-centered therapy, the therapist uses the technique of active listening. In active listening, the therapistacknowledges, restates, and clarifies what the client expresses. Therapists also practice what Rogers calledunconditional positive regard, which involves not judging clients and simply accepting them for who theyare. Rogers (1951) also felt that therapists should demonstrate genuineness, empathy, and acceptance towardtheir clients because this helps people become more accepting of themselves, which results in personalgrowth.Evaluating Various Forms of PsychotherapyHow can we assess the effectiveness of psychotherapy? Is one technique more effective than another? Foranyone considering therapy, these are important questions. According to the American PsychologicalAssociation, three factors work together to produce successful treatment. The first is the use of evidence-basedtreatment that is deemed appropriate for your particular issue. The second important factor is the clinicalexpertise of the psychologist or therapist. The third factor is your own characteristics, values, preferences, andculture. Many people begin psychotherapy feeling like their problem will never be resolved; however,psychotherapy helps people see that they can do things to make their situation better. Psychotherapy can helpreduce a person\u2019s anxiety, depression, and maladaptive behaviors. Through psychotherapy, individuals canlearn to engage in healthy behaviors designed to help them better express emotions, improve relationships,think more positively, and perform more effectively at work or school.Many studies have explored the effectiveness of psychotherapy. For example, one large-scale study thatexamined 16 meta-analyses of CBT reported that it was equally effective or more effective than other therapiesin treating PTSD, generalized anxiety disorder, depression, and social phobia (Butlera, Chapmanb, Formanc, &Becka, 2006). Another study found that CBT was as effective at treating depression (43% success rate) asprescription medication (50% success rate) compared to the placebo rate of 25% (DeRubeis et al., 2005).Another meta-analysis found that psychodynamic therapy was also as effective at treating these types ofpsychological issues as CBT (Shedler, 2010). However, no studies have found one psychotherapeutic approachmore effective than another (Abbass, Kisely, & Kroenke, 2006; Chorpita et al., 2011), nor have they shown anyrelationship between a client\u2019s treatment outcome and the level of the clinician\u2019s training or experience"

Regardless of which type of psychotherapy an individual chooses, one critical factor thatdetermines the success of treatment is the person\u2019s relationship with the psychologist or therapist.Biomedical TherapiesIndividuals can be prescribed biologically based treatments or psychotropic medications that are used to treatmental disorders. While these are often used in combination with psychotherapy, they also are taken byindividuals not in therapy. This is known as biomedical therapy. Medications used to treat psychologicaldisorders are called psychotropic medications and are prescribed by medical doctors, including psychiatrists.In Louisiana and New Mexico, psychologists are able to prescribe some types of these medications (AmericanPsychological Association, 2014).Different types and classes of medications are prescribed for different disorders. An individual withdepression might be given an antidepressant, an individual with bipolar disorder might be given a moodstabilizer, and an individual with schizophrenia might be given an antipsychotic. These medications treat thesymptoms of a psychological disorder by altering the levels or effects of neurotransmitters. For example, eachtype of antidepressant affects a different neurotransmitter, such as SSRI (selective serotonin reuptakeinhibitor) antidepressants that increase the level of the neurotransmitter serotonin, and SNRI (serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor) antidepressants that increase the levels of both serotonin andnorepinephrine. They can help people feel better so that they can function on a daily basis, but they do not curethe disorder. Some people may only need to take a psychotropic medication for a short period of time. Otherswith severe disorders like bipolar disorder or schizophrenia may need to take psychotropic medication for along time.Psychotropic medications are a popular treatment option for many types of disorders, and research suggeststhat they are most effective when combined with psychotherapy. This is especially true for the most commonmental disorders, such as depressive and anxiety disorders (Cuijpers et al, 2014). When considering addingmedication as a treatment option, individuals should know that some psychotropic medications have veryconcerning side effects. Table 16.2 shows the commonly prescribed types of medications, how they are used,and someof the potential side effects that may occur.Some Commonly Prescribed Psychotropic MedicationsType ofMedicationUsed to TreatBrand Names ofCommonlyPrescribedMedicationsHow They WorkSide EffectsSchizophreniaand othertypes ofseverethoughtdisordersHaldol, Mellaril,Prolixin,ThorazineTreat positive psychoticsymptoms such as auditory andvisual hallucinations, delusions,and paranoia by blocking theneurotransmitter dopamineLong-term use can leadto tardive dyskinesia,involuntary movementsof the arms, legs,tongue and facialmuscles, resulting inParkinson\u2019s-like tremorsAntipsychotics(developed inthe 1950s)TABLE 16.2"

However, it\u2019s not a novel concept but one that has beenused in medicine for at least two decades. Evidence-based practice is used to reduce errors in treatmentselection by making clinical decisions based on research (Sackett & Rosenberg, 1995). In any case, evidence-based treatment is on the rise in the field of psychology. So what is it, and why does it matter? In an effort todetermine which treatment methodologies are evidenced-based, professional organizations such as theAmerican Psychological Association (APA) have recommended that specific psychological treatments be used totreat certain psychological disorders (Chambless & Ollendick, 2001). According to the APA (2005), \u201cEvidence-based practice in psychology (EBPP) is the integration of the best available research with clinical expertise in thecontext of patient characteristics, culture, and preferences\u201d (p. 1).The foundational idea behind evidence based treatment is that best practices are determined by researchevidence that has been compiled by comparing various forms of treatment (Charman & Barkham, 2005). Thesetreatments are then operationalized and placed in treatment manuals\u2014trained therapists follow these manuals.The benefits are that evidence-based treatment can reduce variability between therapists to ensure that aspecific approach is delivered with integrity (Charman & Barkham, 2005). Therefore, clients have a higher chanceof receiving therapeutic interventions that are effective at treating their specific disorder. While EBPP is based onrandomized control trials, critics of EBPP reject it stating that the results of trials cannot be applied to individualsand instead determinations regarding treatment should be based on a therapist\u2019s judgment (Mullen & Streiner,2004)."

The therapist informs the client about confidentiality, fees, and what to expect intreatment. Confidentiality means the therapist cannot disclose confidential communications to any thirdparty unless mandated or permitted by law to do so. During the intake, the therapist and client will worktogether to discuss treatment goals. Then a treatment plan will be formulated, usually with specificmeasurable objectives. Also, the therapist and client will discuss how treatment success will be measured andthe estimated length of treatment. There are several different modalities of treatment (Figure 16.14):Individual therapy, family therapy, couples therapy, and group therapy are the most common."

(credit a:modification of work by Connor Ashleigh, AusAID/Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade)Individual TherapyIn individual therapy, also known as individual psychotherapy or individual counseling, the client andclinician meet one-on-one (usually from 45 minutes to 1 hour). These meetings typically occur weekly or everyother week, and sessions are conducted in a confidential and caring environment (Figure 16.15). The clinicianwill work with clients to help them explore their feelings, work through life challenges, identify aspects ofthemselves and their lives that they wish to change, and set goals to help them work towards these changes. Aclient might see a clinician for only a few sessions, or the client may attend individual therapy sessions for ayear or longer.

A woman suffering from post-partum depression could feel less guilty and more supported by being in agroup with similar women.Group therapy also has some specific limitations. Members of the group may be afraid to speak in front ofother people because sharing secrets and problems with complete strangers can be stressful andoverwhelming. There may be personality clashes and arguments among group members. There could also beconcerns about confidentiality: Someone from the group might share what another participant said to peopleoutside of the group.FIGURE 16.16 In group therapy, usually 5\u201310 people meet with a trained therapist to discuss a common issue suchas divorce, grief, an eating disorder, substance abuse, or anger management. (credit: Cory Zanker)Another benefit of group therapy is that members can confront each other about their patterns. For those withsome types of problems, such as sexual abusers, group therapy is the recommended treatment. Grouptreatment for this population is considered to have several benefits:Group treatment is more economical than individual, couples, or family therapy. Sexual abusers oftenfeel more comfortable admitting and discussing their offenses in a treatment group where others aremodeling openness. Clients often accept feedback about their behavior more willingly from othergroup members than from therapists. Finally, clients can practice social skills in group treatmentsettings. (McGrath, Cumming, Burchard, Zeoli, & Ellerby, 2009)Groups that have a strong educational component are called psycho-educational groups. For example, a groupfor children whose parents have cancer might discuss in depth what cancer is, types of treatment for cancer,and the side effects of treatments, such as hair loss. Often, group therapy sessions with children take place inschool. They are led by a school counselor, a school psychologist, or a school social worker. Groups might focuson test anxiety, social isolation, self-esteem, bullying, or school failure (Shechtman, 2002). Whether the groupis held in school or in a clinician\u2019s office, group therapy has been found to be effective with children facingnumerous kinds of challenges (Shechtman, 2002).During a group session, the entire group could reflect on an individual\u2019s problem or difficulties, and othersmight disclose what they have done in that situation. When a clinician is facilitating a group, the focus isalways on making sure that everyone benefits and participates in the group and that no one person is the focusof the entire session. Groups can be organized in various ways: some have an overarching theme or purpose,some are time-limited, some have open membership that allows people to come and go, and some are closed.Some groups are structured with planned activities and goals, while others are unstructured: There is nospecific plan, and group members themselves decide how the group will spend its time and on what goals itwill focus. This can become a complex and emotionally charged process, but it is also an opportunity forpersonal growth (Page & Berkow, 1994)."

The couple may be dating, partnered, engaged, or married. The primarytherapeutic orientation used in couples counseling is cognitive-behavioral therapy (Rathus & Sanderson,1999). Couples meet with a therapist to discuss conflicts and/or aspects of their relationship that they want tochange. The therapist helps them see how their individual backgrounds, beliefs, and actions are affecting theirrelationship. Often, a therapist tries to help the couple resolve these problems, as well as implement strategiesthat will lead to a healthier and happier relationship, such as how to listen, how to argue, and how to expressfeelings. However, sometimes, after working with a therapist, a couple will realize that they are tooincompatible and will decide to separate. Some couples seek therapy to work out their problems, while othersattend therapy to determine whether staying together is the best solution. Counseling couples in a high-conflict and volatile relationship can be difficult. In fact, psychologists Peter Pearson and Ellyn Bader, whofounded the Couples Institute in Palo Alto, California, have compared the experience of the clinician incouples\u2019 therapy to be like \u201cpiloting a helicopter in a hurricane\u201d (Weil, 2012, para. 7).FIGURE 16.17 In couples counseling, a therapist helps people work on their relationship. (credit: Cory Zanker)Family TherapyFamily therapy is a special form of group therapy, consisting of one or more families. Although there are manytheoretical orientations in family therapy, one of the most predominant is the systems approach. The family isviewed as an organized system, and each individual within the family is a contributing member who createsand maintains processes within the system that shape behavior (Minuchin, 1985). Each member of the familyinfluences and is influenced by the others. The goal of this approach is to enhance the growth of each familymember as well as that of the family as a whole.Often, dysfunctional patterns of communication that develop between family members can lead to conflict. Afamily with this dynamic might wish to attend therapy together rather than individually. In many cases, onemember of the family has problems that detrimentally affect everyone. For example, a mother\u2019s depression,teen daughter\u2019s eating disorder, or father\u2019s alcohol dependence could affect all members of the family. Thetherapist would work with all members of the family to help them cope with the issue, and to encourageresolution and growth in the case of the individual family member with the problem.With family therapy, the nuclear family (i.e., parents and children) or the nuclear family plus whoever lives inthe household (e.g., grandparent) come into treatment.

Substance-related treatment is considered much more cost-effective than incarceration ornot treating those with addictions (NIDA, 2012) (Figure 16.19).FIGURE 16.19 Substance use and abuse costs the United States over $600 billion a year (NIDA, 2012). This personwith addiction is using heroin. (credit: \"jellymc - urbansnaps\"/Flickr)What Makes Treatment Effective?Specific factors make substance-related treatment much more effective. One factor is duration of treatment.Generally, a person with addict needs to be in treatment for at least three months to achieve a positiveoutcome (Simpson, 1981; Simpson, Joe, & Bracy, 1982; NIDA, 2012). This is due to the psychological,physiological, behavioral, and social aspects of abuse (Simpson, 1981; Simpson et al., 1982; NIDA, 2012).While in treatment, a person with addiction might receive behavior therapy, which can help motivate theperson with addiction to participate in the treatment program and teach strategies for dealing with cravingsand how to prevent relapse. Also, treatment needs to be holistic and address multiple needs, not just the drugaddiction. This means that treatment will address factors such as communication, stress management,relationship issues, parenting, vocational concerns, and legal concerns (McGovern & Carroll, 2003; NIDA,2012).While individual therapy is used in the treatment of substance-related disorders, group therapy is the mostwidespread treatment modality (Weiss, Jaffee, de Menil, & Cogley, 2004). The rationale behind using grouptherapy for addiction treatment is that people with addiction are much more likely to maintain sobriety in agroup format. It has been suggested that this is due to the rewarding and therapeutic benefits of the group,such as support, affiliation, identification, and even confrontation (Center for Substance Abuse Treatment,2005). For teenagers, the whole family often needs to participate in treatment to address issues such as familydynamics, communication, and relapse prevention. Family involvement in teen drug addiction is vital.Research suggests that greater parental involvement is correlated with a greater reduction in use by teensubstance abusers. Also, mothers who participated in treatment displayed better mental health and greaterwarmth toward their children (Bertrand et al., 2013). However, neither individual nor group therapy has beenfound to be more effective (Weiss et al., 2004). Regardless of the type of treatment service, the primary focus ison abstinence or at the very least a significant reduction in use (McGovern & Carroll, 2003).Treatment also usually involves medications to detox a person with addiction safely after an overdose, toprevent seizures and agitation that often occur in detox, to prevent reuse of the drug, and to managewithdrawal symptoms. Getting off drugs often involves the use of drugs\u2014some of which can be just asaddictive. Detox can be difficult and dangerous."

Compared with the overall population,people who use illicit drugs or misuse prescription drugs are twice as likely to have a mood or anxiety disorder.Drug use can cause symptoms of mood and anxiety disorders and the reverse is also true\u2014people withdebilitating symptoms of a psychiatric disorder may self-medicate and misuse substances.In cases of comorbidity, the best treatment is thought to address both (or multiple) disorders simultaneously(NIDA, 2012). Behavior therapies are used to treat comorbid conditions, and in many cases, psychotropicmedications are used along with psychotherapy. For example, evidence suggests that bupropion (trade names:Wellbutrin and Zyban), approved for treating depression and nicotine dependence, might also help reducecraving and use of the drug methamphetamine (NIDA, 2011). However, more research is needed to betterunderstand how these medications work\u2014particularly when combined in patients with comorbidities."

        "data": "LEARNING OBJECTIVESBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\u2022 Explain how the sociocultural model is used in therapy\u2022 Discuss barriers to mental health services among ethnic minoritiesThe sociocultural perspective looks at you, your behaviors, and your symptoms in the context of your cultureand background. For example, Jos\u00e9 is an 18-year-old Hispanic male from a traditional family. Jos\u00e9 comes totreatment because of depression. During the intake session, he reveals that he is gay and is nervous abouttelling his family. He also discloses that he is concerned because his religious background has taught him thatbeing gay is wrong. How does his religious and cultural background affect him? How might his culturalbackground affect how his family reacts if Jos\u00e9 were to tell them he is gay?Mental health professionals must develop cultural competence (Figure 16.20), which means they mustunderstand and address issues of race, culture, and ethnicity. They must also develop strategies to effectivelyaddress the needs of various populations for which Eurocentric therapies have limited application (Sue, 2004).For example, a counselor whose treatment focuses on individual decision making may be ineffective at helpinga Chinese client with a collectivist approach to problem solving (Sue, 2004).Multicultural counseling and therapy aims to offer both a helping role and process that uses modalities anddefines goals consistent with the life experiences and cultural values of clients. It strives to recognize clientidentities to include individual, group, and universal dimensions, advocate the use of universal and culture-specific strategies and roles in the healing process, and balances the importance of individualism andcollectivism in the assessment, diagnosis, and treatment of client and client systems (Sue, 2001).This therapeutic perspective integrates the impact of cultural and social norms, starting at the beginning oftreatment. Therapists who use this perspective work with clients to obtain and integrate information abouttheir cultural patterns into a unique treatment approach based on their particular situation (Stewart,Simmons, & Habibpour, 2012). Sociocultural therapy can include individual, group, family, and couplestreatment modalities."

Why is this so? Perhaps the reasonhas to do with access and availability of mental health services. Ethnic minorities and individuals of lowsocioeconomic status (SES) report that barriers to services include lack of insurance, transportation, and time(Thomas & Snowden, 2002). However, researchers have found that even when income levels and insurancevariables are taken into account, ethnic minorities are far less likely to seek out and utilize mental healthservices. And when access to mental health services is comparable across ethnic and racial groups, differencesin service utilization remain (Richman et al., 2007).In a study involving thousands of women, it was found that the prevalence rate of anorexia was similar acrossdifferent races, but that bulimia nervosa was more prevalent among Hispanic and African American womenwhen compared with non-Hispanic White people (Marques et al., 2011). Although they have similar or higherrates of eating disorders, Hispanic and African American women with these disorders tend to seek and engagein treatment far less than White women. These findings suggest ethnic disparities in access to care, as well asclinical and referral practices that may prevent Hispanic and African American women from receiving care,which could include lack of bilingual treatment, stigma, fear of not being understood, family privacy, and lackof education about eating disorders.Perceptions and attitudes toward mental health services may also contribute to this imbalance. A recent studyat King\u2019s College, London, found many complex reasons why people do not seek treatment: self-sufficiency andnot seeing the need for help, not seeing therapy as effective, concerns about confidentiality, and the manyeffects of stigma and shame (Clement et al., 2014). And in another study, African Americans exhibitingdepression were less willing to seek treatment due to fear of possible psychiatric hospitalization as well as fearof the treatment itself (Sussman, Robins, & Earls, 1987). Instead of mental health treatment, many AfricanAmericans prefer to be self-reliant or use spiritual practices (Snowden, 2001; Belgrave & Allison, 2010). Forexample, it has been found that the Black church plays a significant role as an alternative to mental health"

For example, in one recent study of 462 older Korean Americans (over the age of 60) many participantsreported suffering from depressive symptoms. However, 71% indicated they thought depression was a sign ofpersonal weakness, and 14% reported that having a mentally ill family member would bring shame to thefamily (Jang, Chiriboga, & Okazaki, 2009).Language differences are a further barrier to treatment. In the previous study on Korean Americans\u2019 attitudestoward mental health services, it was found that there were no Korean-speaking mental health professionalswhere the study was conducted (Orlando and Tampa, Florida) (Jang et al., 2009). Because of the growingnumber of people from ethnically diverse backgrounds, there is a need for therapists and psychologists todevelop knowledge and skills to become culturally competent (Ahmed, Wilson, Henriksen, & Jones, 2011).Those providing therapy must approach the process from the context of the unique culture of each client (Sue& Sue, 2007).DIG DEEPERSupporting Mental Health TreatmentIn the United States, about one in six children and one in five adults experiences a mental health disorder, butfewer than half of these people receive professional support for their disorder (Whitney & Peterson, 2019).Access to qualified mental health professionals is not universal or equitable, but it has improved to the point thatmore people could receive help if they sought it. Why then, do so many people go without support, therapy, ortreatment?It seems that the public has a negative perception of people with mental health disorders. According toresearchers from Indiana University, the University of Virginia, and Columbia University, interviews with over1,300 U.S. adults show that they believe children with depression are prone to violence and that if a childreceives treatment for a psychological disorder, then that child is more likely to be rejected by peers at school.Bernice Pescosolido, author of the study, asserts that this is a misconception. And it is not limited to perceptionsof mental health issues in children: adults living with mental health issues may face even more scrutiny whensharing their condition or seeking support. Stigmatization of psychological disorders is one of the main reasonswhy people do not get the help they need when they are having difficulties. Pescosolido and her colleaguescaution that this stigma surrounding mental illness, based on misconceptions rather than facts, can bedevastating to emotional and social well-being.Fortunately, we are starting to see discussions related to the destigmatization of mental illness and an increasein public education and awareness. Dozens of leaders have contributed to the conversation, including athleteslike Naomi Osaka, Simone Biles, Michael Phelps, Kevin Love, and Dak Prescott, as well as artists such as Adele,Bruce Springsteen, Ariana Grande, Big Sean, and Bebe Rexha. Mental health awareness is stronger withinworkplaces, educational settings, and communities overall. However, stigma remains, particularly regardingmental health issues that are frequently misunderstood.The National Alliance on Mental Illness (NAMI) outlines key considerations regarding support, sensitivity, andcompassion regarding mental health:\u2022 Talk and listen openly about mental health: if you are confident and comfortable sharing your own mentalhealth story, you may help someone else.

These people were forced to take part in exorcisms, were imprisoned, or executed.Later, asylums were built to house the mentally ill, but the patients received little to no treatment, and many ofthe methods used were cruel. Philippe Pinel and Dorothea Dix argued for more humane treatment of peoplewith psychological disorders. In the mid-1960s, the deinstitutionalization movement gained support andasylums were closed, enabling people with mental illness to return home and receive treatment in their owncommunities. Some did go to their family homes, but many became homeless due to a lack of resources andsupport mechanisms.Today, instead of asylums, there are psychiatric hospitals run by state governments and local communityhospitals, with the emphasis on short-term stays. However, most people who have mental illness are nothospitalized. A person suffering symptoms could speak with a primary care physician, who most likely wouldrefer him to someone who specializes in therapy. The person can receive outpatient mental health servicesfrom a variety of sources, including psychologists, psychiatrists, marriage and family therapists, schoolcounselors, clinical social workers, and religious personnel. These therapy sessions would be covered throughinsurance, government funds, or private (self) pay."
