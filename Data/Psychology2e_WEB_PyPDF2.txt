1.1 What Is Psychology?
LEARNING OBJEC TIVES
By the end o f this section, y ou wil l be able t o:
•Define ps ycholog y
•Unders tand the merits o f an education in ps ycholog y
Wha t is cre ativity? Wha t are prejudic e and discrimina tion? Wha t is c onsciousnes s? The field o f psycholog y
explores ques tions lik e these .Psycholog yrefers to the scientific s tudy o f the mind and b ehavior . Psychologis ts
use the scientific metho d to ac quire kno wledge. To apply the scientific metho d, a rese archer with a ques tion
about ho w or wh y something happ ens will prop ose a tenta tive explana tion , called a h ypothesis , to e xplain the
phenomenon . A h ypothesis should fit into the c onte xt of a scientific theor y, which is a bro ad e xplana tion or
group o f explana tions f or some asp ect o f the na tural w orld tha t is c onsis tently supp orted by evidenc e over
time . A theor y is the b est unders tanding w e ha ve of tha t part of the na tural w orld . The rese archer then mak es
obser vations or c arries out an e xperiment to tes t the v alidity o f the h ypothesis . Those results are then
publishe d or presente d at rese arch c onferenc es so tha t others c an replic ate or build on the results .
Scientis ts tes t tha t which is p erceivable and me asura ble. For e xample , the h ypothesis tha t a bird sings b ecause
it is happ y is not a h ypothesis tha t can b e tes ted sinc e we ha ve no w ay to me asure the happines s of a bird . We
mus t ask a diff erent ques tion , perhaps a bout the brain s tate of the bird , sinc e this c an b e me asure d. Ho wever,
we can ask individuals a bout whether the y sing b ecause the y are happ y sinc e the y are a ble to tell us . Thus ,
psychologic al scienc e is empiric al, based on me asura ble da ta.
In g eneral , scienc e de als only with ma tter and energ y, tha t is, those things tha t can b e me asure d, and it c annot
arriv e at kno wledge about v alues and morality . This is one re ason wh y our scientific unders tanding o f the
mind is so limite d, sinc e thoughts , at least as w e experienc e them , are neither ma tter nor energ y. The scientific
metho d is also a f orm o f empiricism . An empiric al metho dfor ac quiring kno wledge is one b ased on
obser vation , including e xperimenta tion , rather than a metho d based only on f orms o f logic al argument or
previous a uthorities .
It was not until the la te 1800s tha t psycholog y became ac cepte d as its o wn ac ademic discipline . Bef ore this
time , the w orkings o f the mind w ere c onsidere d under the a uspic es o f philosoph y. Giv en tha t an y behavior is ,
at its ro ots, biologic al, some are as o f psycholog y tak e on asp ects o f a na tural scienc e lik e biolog y. No biologic al
organism e xists in isola tion , and our b ehavior is influenc ed by our interactions with others . Theref ore,
psycholog y is also a so cial scienc e.
WHY STUD Y PS YCHOL OGY?
Often , students tak e their firs t psycholog y course b ecause the y are interes ted in helping others and w ant to
learn more a bout themselv es and wh y the y act the w ay the y do . Sometimes , students tak e a ps ycholog y course
because it either sa tisfies a g eneral e ducation re quirement or is re quire d for a program o f study such as
nursing or pre -me d. Man y of these s tudents dev elop such an interes t in the are a tha t the y go on to declare
psycholog y as their major . As a result , psycholog y is one o f the mos t popular majors on c olleg e campuses
acros s the Unite d Sta tes (J ohnson & L ubin , 2011). A numb er o f well-kno wn individuals w ere ps ycholog y
majors . Just a few famous names on this lis t are F acebook’s cre ator Mark Z uckerberg, television p ersonality
and p olitic al sa tiris t Jon Stew art, actres s Natalie P ortman , and filmmak er W es C raven (Halonen , 2011). Ab out
6 percent o f all b achelor degrees grante d in the Unite d Sta tes are in the discipline o f psycholog y (U .S.
Dep artment o f Education , 2016).8 1 • Intr oduction t o Psycholog y

An e ducation in ps ycholog y is v alua ble f or a numb er o f reasons . Psycholog y students hone critic al thinking
skills and are traine d in the use o f the scientific metho d. Critic al thinking is the activ e applic ation o f a set o f
skills to inf orma tion f or the unders tanding and ev alua tion o f tha t inf orma tion . The ev alua tion o f
informa tion—as sessing its relia bility and usefulnes s— is an imp ortant skill in a w orld full o f comp eting “facts ,”
man y of which are designe d to b e misle ading . For e xample , critic al thinking in volves maintaining an a ttitude
of skepticism , rec ognizing internal biases , making use o f logic al thinking , asking appropria te ques tions , and
making obser vations . Psycholog y students also c an dev elop b etter c ommunic ation skills during the c ourse o f
their undergradua te coursew ork (Americ an P sychologic al As sociation , 2011). T ogether , these factors incre ase
students’ scientific literacy and prep are s tudents to critic ally ev alua te the v arious sourc es o f inf orma tion the y
encounter .
In addition to these bro ad-b ased skills , psycholog y students c ome to unders tand the c omple x factors tha t
shap e one ’s behavior . The y apprecia te the interaction o f our biolog y, our en vironment , and our e xperienc es in
determining who w e are and ho w w e will b ehave. The y learn a bout b asic principles tha t guide ho w w e think
and b ehave, and the y come to rec ogniz e the tremendous div ersity tha t exists acros s individuals and acros s
cultural b oundaries (Americ an P sychologic al As sociation , 2011).

Psycholog y is a rela tively y oung scienc e with its e xperimental ro ots in the 19th c entur y, comp ared, for
example , to human ph ysiolog y, which da tes much e arlier . As mentione d, anyone interes ted in e xploring is sues
rela ted to the mind g enerally did so in a philosophic al conte xt prior to the 19th c entur y. Tw o 19th c entur y
scholars , Wilhelm W undt and W illiam J ames , are g enerally cre dite d as b eing the f ounders o f psycholog y as a
scienc e and ac ademic discipline tha t was dis tinct from philosoph y. This section will pro vide an o verview o f the
shifts in p aradigms tha t ha ve influenc ed ps ycholog y from W undt and J ames through to day.
Wundt and Structur alism
Wilhelm Wundt (1832–1920) w as a German scientis t who w as the firs t person to b e ref erre d to as a
psychologis t. His famous b ook entitle dPrinciples o f Ph ysiologic al Psycholog ywas publishe d in 1873. W undt
view ed ps ycholog y as a scientific s tudy o f conscious e xperienc e, and he b eliev ed tha t the g oal of psycholog y
was to identif y comp onents o f consciousnes s and ho w those c omp onents c ombine d to result in our c onscious
experienc e. Wundt use dintrosp ection (he c alled it “internal p erception ”), a pro cess by which someone
examines their o wn c onscious e xperienc e as objectiv ely as p ossible , making the human mind lik e an y other
aspect o f na ture tha t a scientis t obser ved. He b eliev ed in the notion o f voluntarism—tha t people ha ve free will
and should kno w the intentions o f a ps ychologic al experiment if the y were p articip ating (Danzig er, 1980).
Wundt c onsidere d his v ersion e xperimental introsp ection; he use d ins truments such as those tha t me asure d
reaction time . He also wrote Volkerps ychologie in 1904 in which he sugg ested tha t psycholog y should include
the s tudy o f culture , as it in volves the s tudy o f people . Edward Titchener , one o f his s tudents , went on to
1.2 • His tory of Psycholog y9
develop structuralism . Its f ocus w as on the c ontents o f mental pro cesses ra ther than their function (Pickren &
Ruther ford, 2010). W undt es tablishe d his ps ycholog y laboratory at the Univ ersity a t Leip zig in 1879 ( Figure
1.2). In this la boratory, Wundt and his s tudents c onducte d experiments on , for e xample , reaction times . A
subject , sometimes in a ro om isola ted from the scientis t, would rec eive a s timulus such as a light , ima ge, or
sound . The subject ’s reaction to the s timulus w ould b e to push a but ton, and an app aratus w ould rec ord the
time to re action . Wundt c ould me asure re action time to one -thousandth o f a sec ond (Nic olas & F errand , 1999).
FIGURE 1.2 (a) Wilhelm W undt is cr edited as one o f the f ounders o f psycholog y. He cr eated the firs t labor atory for
psychological r esear ch. (b) This phot o sho ws him seat ed and surr ounded b y fellow resear chers and equipment in
his labor atory in German y.
However, despite his eff orts to train individuals in the pro cess of introsp ection , this pro cess remaine d highly
subjectiv e, and there w as v ery little a greement b etween individuals .
Functionalism
William J ames , John Dew ey, and Charles Sanders P eirc e help ed es tablish functional ps ycholog y (Figure 1.3 ).
The y ac cepte d Dar win’s theor y of evolution b y na tural selection and view ed this theor y as an e xplana tion o f an
organism ’s characteris tics. Key to tha t theor y is the ide a tha t na tural selection le ads to org anisms tha t are
adapte d to their en vironment , including their b ehavior . Adapta tion me ans tha t a trait o f an org anism has a
function f or the sur vival and repro duction o f the individual , because it has b een na turally selecte d. As J ames
saw it, psycholog y’s purp ose w as to s tudy the function o f behavior in the w orld , and as such , his p ersp ectiv e
was kno wn as funct ionalism . Functionalism f ocuse d on ho w mental activities help ed an org anism fit into its
environment . Functionalism has a sec ond , more subtle me aning in tha t functionalis ts w ere more interes ted in
the op eration o f the whole mind ra ther than o f its individual p arts, which w ere the f ocus o f structuralism . Lik e
Wundt , James b eliev ed tha t introsp ection c ould ser ve as one me ans b y which someone might s tudy mental
activities , but J ames also relie d on more objectiv e me asures , including the use o f various rec ording devic es,
and e xamina tions o f concrete pro ducts o f mental activities and o f ana tom y and ph ysiolog y (Gordon , 1995).10 1 • Intr oduction t o Psycholog y

Freud and Psychoanalytic Theory
Perhaps one o f the mos t influential and w ell-kno wn figures in ps ycholog y’s his tory was Sigmund Freud (Figure
1.4). Freud (1856–1939) w as an A ustrian neurologis t who w as fascina ted by patients suff ering from “h ysteria ”
and neurosis . Hy steria w as an ancient dia gnosis f or disorders , primarily o f women with a wide v ariety o f
symptoms , including ph ysical symptoms and emotional dis turb ances, none o f which had an app arent ph ysical
cause. Freud theoriz ed tha t man y of his p atients’ problems arose from the unc onscious mind . In F reud ’s view ,
the unc onscious mind w as a rep ositor y of feelings and urg es o f which w e ha ve no a warenes s. Gaining ac cess to
the unc onscious , then , was cr ucial to the suc cessful resolution o f the p atient ’s problems . According to F reud ,
the unc onscious mind c ould b e ac cessed through dre am analy sis, by examina tions o f the firs t words tha t came
to p eople ’s minds , and through seemingly inno cent slips o f the tongue .Psycho analyt ic theor yfocuses on the
role o f a p erson ’s unc onscious , as w ell as e arly childho od experienc es, and this p articular p ersp ectiv e
domina ted clinic al ps ycholog y for sev eral dec ades ( Thorne & Henle y, 2005).
FIGURE 1.4 (a) Sigmund F reud w as a highl y influential fig ure in the his tory of psycholog y. (b) One o f his man y
book s,A Gener al Intr oduction t o Psychoanal ysis, shar ed his ideas about ps ychoanal ytical ther apy; it w as published
in 1922.
Freud ’s ide as w ere influential , and y ou will le arn more a bout them when y ou s tudy lif espan dev elopment ,
personality , and therap y. For ins tanc e, man y therapis ts believ e strongly in the unc onscious and the imp act o f1.2 • His tory of Psycholog y11
early childho od experienc es on the res t of a p erson ’s life. The metho d of psychoanaly sis, which in volves the
patient talking a bout their e xperienc es and selv es, while not in vente d by Freud , was c ertainly p opulariz ed by
him and is s till use d to day. Man y of Freud ’s other ide as, however, are c ontro versial . Drew W esten (1998) argues
that man y of the criticisms o f Freud ’s ide as are misplac ed, in tha t the y attack his older ide as without taking
into ac count la ter writings . Westen also argues tha t critics fail to c onsider the suc cess of the bro ad ide as tha t
Freud intro duced or dev elop ed, such as the imp ortanc e of childho od experienc es in adult motiv ations , the role
of unc onscious v ersus c onscious motiv ations in driving our b ehavior , the fact tha t motiv ations c an c ause
conflicts tha t affect b ehavior , the eff ects o f mental representa tions o f ourselv es and others in guiding our
interactions , and the dev elopment o f personality o ver time . Westen identifies subse quent rese arch supp ort for
all o f these ide as.
More mo dern itera tions o f Freud ’s clinic al appro ach ha ve been empiric ally demons trated to b e eff ectiv e (K nek t
et al ., 2008; She dler , 2010). Some current practic es in ps ychotherap y involve examining unc onscious asp ects
of the self and rela tionships , often through the rela tionship b etween the therapis t and the client . Freud ’s
historic al signific ance and c ontributions to clinic al practic e merit his inclusion in a discus sion o f the his toric al
movements within ps ycholog y.
Wertheimer , Koffk a, K öhler , and Gestalt Psychology
Max W ertheimer (1880–1943), K urt Koffka (1886–1941), and W olfg ang K öhler (1887–1967) w ere three
German ps ychologis ts who immigra ted to the Unite d Sta tes in the e arly 20th c entur y to esc ape Nazi German y.
These scholars are cre dite d with intro ducing ps ychologis ts in the Unite d Sta tes to v arious Ges talt principles .
The w ord Gestalt roughly transla tes to “ whole;” a major emphasis o f Ges talt ps ycholog y de als with the fact tha t
although a sensor y experienc e can b e brok en do wn into individual p arts, how those p arts rela te to e ach other
as a whole is o ften wha t the individual resp onds to in p erception . For e xample , a song ma y be made up o f
individual notes pla yed by diff erent ins truments , but the re al na ture o f the song is p erceived in the
combina tions o f these notes as the y form the melo dy, rhythm , and harmon y. In man y ways, this p articular
persp ectiv e would ha ve directly c ontradicte d W undt ’s ide as o f structuralism ( Thorne & Henle y, 2005).
Unfortuna tely, in mo ving to the Unite d Sta tes, these scientis ts w ere f orced to a bandon much o f their w ork and
were una ble to c ontinue to c onduct rese arch on a larg e sc ale. These factors along with the rise o f behaviorism
(describ ed ne xt) in the Unite d Sta tes prev ente d principles o f Ges talt ps ycholog y from b eing as influential in
the Unite d Sta tes as the y had b een in their na tive German y (Thorne & Henle y, 2005). Despite these is sues ,
several Ges talt principles are s till v ery influential to day. Considering the human individual as a whole ra ther
than as a sum o f individually me asure d parts became an imp ortant f ounda tion in humanis tic theor y late in the
centur y. The ide as o f Ges talt ha ve continue d to influenc e rese arch on sensa tion and p erception .
Structuralism , Freud , and the Ges talt ps ychologis ts w ere all c oncerne d in one w ay or another with describing
and unders tanding inner e xperienc e. But other rese archers had c oncerns tha t inner e xperienc e could b e a
legitima te subject o f scientific inquir y and chose ins tead to e xclusiv ely s tudy b ehavior , the objectiv ely
obser vable outc ome o f mental pro cesses.
Pavlov , Watson, Skinner , and Behaviorism
Early w ork in the field o f behavior w as c onducte d by the R ussian ph ysiologis t IvanPavlov(1849–1936). P avlov
studie d a f orm o f learning b ehavior c alled a c onditione d refle x, in which an animal or human pro duced a
refle x (unc onscious) resp onse to a s timulus and , over time , was c onditione d to pro duce the resp onse to a
different s timulus tha t the e xperimenter as sociated with the original s timulus . The refle x Pavlov worked with
was saliv ation in resp onse to the presenc e of food. The saliv ation refle x could b e elicite d using a sec ond
stimulus , such as a sp ecific sound , tha t was presente d in as sociation with the initial f ood stimulus sev eral
times . Onc e the resp onse to the sec ond s timulus w as “le arne d,” the f ood stimulus c ould b e omit ted. Pavlov’s
“clas sical conditioning ” is only one f orm o f learning b ehavior s tudie d by behavioris ts.
John B .Watson (1878–1958) w as an influential Americ an ps ychologis t whose mos t famous w ork o ccurre d12 1 • Intr oduction t o Psycholog y
Access for fr ee a t opens tax. org
during the e arly 20th c entur y at Johns Hopkins Univ ersity ( Figure 1.5 ). While W undt and J ames w ere
concerne d with unders tanding c onscious e xperienc e, Watson thought tha t the s tudy o f consciousnes s was
flawed. Bec ause he b eliev ed tha t objectiv e analy sis o f the mind w as imp ossible , Watson pref erre d to f ocus
directly on obser vable b ehavior and tr y to bring tha t behavior under c ontrol . Watson w as a major prop onent o f
shifting the f ocus o f psycholog y from the mind to b ehavior , and this appro ach o f obser ving and c ontrolling
behavior c ame to b e kno wn as beha viorism . A major object o f study b y behavioris ts w as le arne d behavior and
its interaction with inb orn qualities o f the org anism . Beha viorism c ommonly use d animals in e xperiments
under the as sumption tha t wha t was le arne d using animal mo dels c ould , to some degree , be applie d to human
behavior . Indee d, Tolman (1938) s tated, “I b eliev e tha t everything imp ortant in ps ycholog y (except … such
matters as in volve so ciety and w ords) c an b e investigated in es senc e through the c ontinue d experimental and
theoretic al analy sis o f the determiners o f rat behavior a t a choic e-point in a maz e.”
FIGURE 1.5 John B . Watson is kno wn as the father o f beha viorism within ps ycholog y.
Beha viorism domina ted experimental ps ycholog y for sev eral dec ades , and its influenc e can s till b e felt to day
(Thorne & Henle y, 2005). Beha viorism is larg ely resp onsible f or es tablishing ps ycholog y as a scientific
discipline through its objectiv e metho ds and esp ecially e xperimenta tion . In addition , it is use d in b ehavioral
and c ognitiv e-behavioral therap y. Beha vior mo dific ation is c ommonly use d in clas sroom set tings . Beha viorism
has also le d to rese arch on en vironmental influenc es on human b ehavior .
B. F.Skinner (1904–1990) w as an Americ an ps ychologis t (Figure 1.6 ). Lik e Watson , Skinner w as a b ehavioris t,
and he c oncentra ted on ho w behavior w as a ffecte d by its c onse quenc es. Theref ore, Skinner sp oke of
reinf orcement and punishment as major factors in driving b ehavior . As a p art of his rese arch , Skinner
develop ed a chamb er tha t allo wed the c areful s tudy o f the principles o f mo difying b ehavior through
reinf orcement and punishment . This devic e, kno wn as an op erant c onditioning chamb er (or more familiarly , a
Skinner b ox), has remaine d a cr ucial resourc e for rese archers s tudying b ehavior ( Thorne & Henle y, 2005).
FIGURE 1.6 (a) B . F. Skinner is famous f or his r esear ch on oper ant c onditioning . (b) Modified v ersions o f the oper ant

The Skinner b oxis a chamb er tha t isola tes the subject from the e xternal en vironment and has a b ehavior
indic ator such as a lev er or a but ton. When the animal pushes the but ton or lev er, the b ox is a ble to deliv er a
positiv e reinf orcement o f the b ehavior (such as f ood) or a punishment (such as a noise).
Skinner ’s focus on p ositiv e and neg ative reinf orcement o f learne d behaviors had a las ting influenc e in

Maslow , Rogers, and Humanism
During the e arly 20th c entur y, Americ an ps ycholog y was domina ted by behaviorism and ps ychoanaly sis.
However, some ps ychologis ts w ere unc omf ortable with wha t the y view ed as limite d persp ectiv es b eing so
influential to the field . The y objecte d to the p essimism and determinism (all actions driv en b y the
unc onscious) o f Freud . The y also dislik ed the re ductionism , or simplif ying na ture , of behaviorism .
Beha viorism is also determinis tic a t its c ore, because it sees human b ehavior as entirely determine d by a
combina tion o f genetics and en vironment . Some ps ychologis ts began to f orm their o wn ide as tha t emphasiz ed
personal c ontrol , intentionality , and a tr ue pre disp osition f or “good” as imp ortant f or our self -concept and our
behavior . Thus , humanism emerg ed.Humanism is a p ersp ectiv e within ps ycholog y tha t emphasiz es the
potential f or g ood tha t is inna te to all humans . Tw o of the mos t well-kno wn prop onents o f humanis tic
psycholog y are Abraham Maslo w and C arl R ogers (O ’Hara, n .d.).
Abraham Maslo w(1908–1970) w as an Americ an ps ychologis t who is b est kno wn f or prop osing a hierarch y of
human nee ds in motiv ating b ehavior ( Figure 1.7 ). Although this c oncept will b e discus sed in more detail in a
later chapter , a brief o verview will b e pro vide d here . Maslo w as serted tha t so long as b asic nee ds nec essary for
survival w ere met (e .g., food, water, shelter), higher -lev el nee ds (e .g., so cial nee ds) w ould b egin to motiv ate
behavior . According to Maslo w, the highes t-lev el nee ds rela te to self -actualiza tion , a pro cess by which w e
achiev e our full p otential . Ob viously , the f ocus on the p ositiv e asp ects o f human na ture tha t are characteris tic
of the humanis tic p ersp ectiv e is evident ( Thorne & Henle y, 2005). Humanis tic ps ychologis ts rejecte d, on
principle , the rese arch appro ach b ased on re ductionis t experimenta tion in the tradition o f the ph ysical and
biologic al scienc es, because it mis sed the “ whole ” human b eing . Beginning with Maslo w and R ogers, there w as
an insis tenc e on a humanis tic rese arch program . This program has b een larg ely qualita tive (not
measurement -based), but there e xist a numb er o f quantita tive rese arch s trains within humanis tic ps ycholog y,
including rese arch on happines s, self -concept, me dita tion , and the outc omes o f humanis tic ps ychotherap y
(Friedman , 2008).14 1 • Intr oduction t o Psycholog y

CarlRogers(1902–1987) w as also an Americ an ps ychologis t who , like Maslo w, emphasiz ed the p otential f or
good tha t exists within all p eople ( Figure 1.8 ). Rogers use d a therap eutic technique kno wn as client -centere d
therap y in helping his clients de al with problema tic is sues tha t resulte d in their seeking ps ychotherap y. Unlik e
a ps ychoanalytic appro ach in which the therapis t pla ys an imp ortant role in interpreting wha t conscious
behavior rev eals a bout the unc onscious mind , client -centere d therap y involves the p atient taking a le ad role in
the therap y ses sion . Rogers b eliev ed tha t a therapis t nee ded to displa y three f eatures to maximiz e the
effectiv enes s of this p articular appro ach: unc onditional p ositiv e reg ard, genuinenes s, and emp athy.
Unc onditional p ositiv e reg ard ref ers to the fact tha t the therapis t accepts their client f or who the y are , no

The Cognitive R evolution
Beha viorism ’s emphasis on objectivity and f ocus on e xternal b ehavior had pulle d ps ychologis ts’ a ttention a way
from the mind f or a prolong ed perio d of time . The e arly w ork o f the humanis tic ps ychologis ts re directe d
attention to the individual human as a whole , and as a c onscious and self -aware b eing . By the 1950s , new
disciplinar y persp ectiv es in linguis tics, neuroscienc e, and c omputer scienc e were emerging , and these are as
reviv ed interes t in the mind as a f ocus o f scientific inquir y. This p articular p ersp ectiv e has c ome to b e kno wn
as the c ognitiv e rev olution (Miller , 2003). B y 1967, Ulric N eisser publishe d the firs t textbook entitle dCognitiv e
Psycholog y, which ser ved as a c ore te xt in c ognitiv e ps ycholog y courses around the c ountr y (Thorne & Henle y,
2005).
Although no one p erson is entirely resp onsible f or starting the c ognitiv e rev olution , Noam Chomsky w as v ery
influential in the e arly da ys of this mo vement ( Figure 1.9 ). Chomsky (1928–), an Americ an linguis t, was
dissatisfied with the influenc e tha t behaviorism had had on ps ycholog y. He b eliev ed tha t psycholog y’s focus on
behavior w as shor t-sighte d and tha t the field had to re -inc orporate mental functioning into its pur view if it
were to o ffer an y me aningful c ontributions to unders tanding b ehavior (Miller , 2003).

Europ ean ps ycholog y had nev er re ally b een as influenc ed by behaviorism as had Americ an ps ycholog y; and
thus , the c ognitiv e rev olution help ed rees tablish lines o f communic ation b etween Europ ean ps ychologis ts and
their Americ an c ounterp arts. Furthermore , psychologis ts began to c ooperate with scientis ts in other fields ,
like anthrop olog y, linguis tics, computer scienc e, and neuroscienc e, among others . This interdisciplinar y
appro ach o ften w as ref erre d to as the c ognitiv e scienc es, and the influenc e and prominenc e of this p articular
persp ectiv e resona tes in mo dern-da y ps ycholog y (Miller , 2003).
Feminist Psy chology
The scienc e of psycholog y has had an impact on human w ellbeing , both positiv e and neg ative. The dominant
influenc e of Western, Whit e, and male academics in the earl y his tory of psycholog y meant that ps ycholog y
developed with the biases inher ent in those individuals , which o ften had neg ative consequenc es for members o f
society who w ere not Whit e or male . Women, members o f ethnic minorities in both the Unit ed Stat es and other
countries , and individuals with se xual orientations other than s traight had difficul ties ent ering the field o f
psycholog y and ther efore influencing its de velopment. The y also suff ered fr om the at titudes o f Whit e male
psychologis ts who w ere not immune t o the nonscientific at titudes pr evalent in the society in which the y

developed and w orked. Until the 1960s , the scienc e of psycholog y was lar gely a “ womanles s” ps ycholog y
(Crawford & Mar ecek, 1989), meaning that f ew women w ere able t o practic e ps ycholog y, so the y had lit tle
influenc e on what w as studied. In addition, the e xperimental subjects o f psycholog y were mos tly men, which
resul ted fr om underl ying as sump tions that g ender had no influenc e on ps ycholog y and that w omen w ere not o f
sufficient int erest to study .
An ar ticle b y Naomi W eisstein, firs t published in 1968 ( Weisstein, 1993), s timulat ed a f eminis t revolution in
psycholog y by presenting a critique o f psycholog y as a scienc e. She also specifical ly criticiz ed male ps ychologis ts
for constructing the ps ycholog y of women entir ely out o f their o wn cul tural biases and without car eful
experimental t ests to verify an y of their char acterizations o f women. W eisstein used, as e xamples , statements b y
prominent ps ychologis ts in the 1960s , such as this quot e by Bruno Bet tleheim: “ We mus t start with the
realization that, as much as w omen w ant t o be g ood scientis ts or engineers , the y want firs t and f oremos t to be
womanl y companions o f men and t o be mothers .” Weisstein’s critique f ormed the f oundation f or the subsequent
development o f a feminis t psycholog y that at temp ted to be fr ee o f the influenc e of male cul tural biases on our
knowledg e of the ps ycholog y of women.
Crawford & Mar ecek (1989) identif y several feminis t appr oaches t o ps ycholog y that can be described as f eminis t
psycholog y. These include r e-evaluating and disc overing the c ontributions o f women t o the his tory of psycholog y,
studying ps ychological g ender diff erences, and ques tioning the male bias pr esent acr oss the pr actic e of the
scientific appr oach t o kno wledg e.

certain p opula tions ha ve been o ver-studie d and the results o f these s tudies ha ve been applie d to other
popula tions . For e xample , Henrich , Heine , and N orenza yan discus s ho w WEIRD so cieties ha ve been

Western so cieties . These diff erenc es o ccur in a v ariety o f are as, including p erception , cooperation , and moral
reasoning . Tha t is, people v ary dep ending on their culture and en vironment . Multicultural ps ychologis ts
develop theories and c onduct rese arch with div erse p opula tions , typic ally within one c ountr y. Cross-cultural
psychologis ts comp are p opula tions acros s countries , such as p articip ants from the Unite d Sta tes c omp ared to

of the ner vous s ystem is rela ted to b ehavior ( Figure 1.10 ). As such , the y often c ombine the rese arch s trategies
of both ps ychologis ts and ph ysiologis ts to ac complish this g oal (as discus sed in C arlson , 2013).

sensor y and motor s ystems , sleep , drug use and a buse , ing estive behavior , repro ductiv e behavior ,
neuro development , plas ticity o f the ner vous s ystem , and biologic al correla tes o f psychologic al disorders .
Given the bro ad are as o f interes t falling under the pur view o f biologic al ps ycholog y, it will prob ably c ome as no
surprise tha t individuals from all sor ts of backgrounds are in volved in this rese arch , including biologis ts,
medical pro fessionals , physiologis ts, and chemis ts. This interdisciplinar y appro ach is o ften ref erre d to as
neuroscienc e, of which biologic al ps ycholog y is a c omp onent (C arlson , 2013).
While biops ycholog y typic ally f ocuses on the imme diate causes o f behavior b ased in the ph ysiolog y of a
human or other animal , evolutionar y ps ycholog y seeks to s tudy the ultima te biologic al causes o f behavior . To
the e xtent tha t a b ehavior is imp acte d by genetics , a b ehavior , like an y ana tomic al characteris tic o f a human or
animal , will demons trate adaption to its surroundings . These surroundings include the ph ysical en vironment
and , sinc e interactions b etween org anisms c an b e imp ortant to sur vival and repro duction , the so cial
environment . The s tudy o f behavior in the c onte xt of evolution has its origins with Charles Dar win , the c o-
disc overer o f the theor y of evolution b y na tural selection . Dar win w as w ell a ware tha t behaviors should b e
adaptiv e and wrote b ooks title d,The Desc ent o f Man (1871) and The Expres sion o f the Emotions in Man and
Animals (1872), to e xplore this field .
Evolutionar y ps ycholog y, and sp ecific ally, the evolutionar y ps ycholog yof humans , has enjo yed a resurg ence in
recent dec ades . To be subject to ev olution b y na tural selection , a b ehavior mus t ha ve a signific ant g enetic
cause. In g eneral , we expect all human cultures to e xpres s a b ehavior if it is c aused genetic ally, sinc e the
genetic diff erenc es among human groups are small . The appro ach tak en b y mos t evolutionar y ps ychologis ts is
to pre dict the outc ome o f a b ehavior in a p articular situa tion b ased on ev olutionar y theor y and then to mak e
obser vations , or c onduct e xperiments , to determine whether the results ma tch the theor y. It is imp ortant to
recogniz e tha t these typ es o f studies are not s trong evidenc e tha t a b ehavior is adaptiv e, sinc e the y lack
informa tion tha t the b ehavior is in some p art genetic and not entirely cultural (Endler , 1986). Demons trating
that a trait , esp ecially in humans , is na turally selecte d is e xtraordinarily difficult; p erhaps f or this re ason ,
some ev olutionar y ps ychologis ts are c ontent to as sume the b ehaviors the y study ha ve genetic determinants
(Confer et al ., 2010).
One other dra wback o f evolutionar y ps ycholog y is tha t the traits tha t we possess no w ev olved under
environmental and so cial c onditions far b ack in human his tory, and w e ha ve a p oor unders tanding o f wha t
these c onditions w ere. This mak es pre dictions a bout wha t is adaptiv e for a b ehavior difficult . Beha vioral traits
need not b e adaptiv e under current c onditions , only under the c onditions o f the p ast when the y ev olved, about
which w e can only h ypothesiz e.
There are man y are as o f human b ehavior f or which ev olution c an mak e pre dictions . Examples include
memor y, ma te choic e, rela tionships b etween kin , friendship and c ooperation , parenting , social org aniza tion ,
and s tatus (C onfer et al ., 2010).
Evolutionar y ps ychologis ts ha ve had suc cess in finding e xperimental c orresp ondenc e between obser vations
and e xpecta tions . In one e xample , in a s tudy o f ma te pref erenc e diff erenc es b etween men and w omen tha t

in some cultures .

As describ ed in a la ter chapter tha t focuses on the results o f studies in sensa tion and p erception , our
experienc e of our w orld is not as simple as the sum total o f all o f the sensor y inf orma tion (or sensa tions)
together . Rather , our e xperienc e (or p erception) is c omple x and is influenc ed by where w e focus our a ttention ,
our previous e xperienc es, and ev en our cultural b ackgrounds .
Cognitive Psychology
As mentione d in the previous section , the c ognitiv e rev olution cre ated an imp etus f or ps ychologis ts to f ocus
their a ttention on b etter unders tanding the mind and mental pro cesses tha t underlie b ehavior . Thus ,cognit ive
psycholog yis the are a of psycholog y tha t focuses on s tudying c ognitions , or thoughts , and their rela tionship to
our e xperienc es and our actions . Lik e biologic al ps ycholog y, cognitiv e ps ycholog y is bro ad in its sc ope and
often in volves c ollaborations among p eople from a div erse rang e of disciplinar y backgrounds . This has le d
some to c oin the term c ognitiv e scienc e to describ e the interdisciplinar y na ture o f this are a of rese arch (Miller ,

Cognitiv e ps ychologis ts ha ve rese arch interes ts tha t span a sp ectr um o f topics , ranging from a ttention to
problem solving to langua ge to memor y. The appro aches use d in s tudying these topics are e qually div erse .
Given such div ersity , cognitiv e ps ycholog y is not c apture d in one chapter o f this te xt p er se; ra ther , various
concepts rela ted to c ognitiv e ps ycholog y will b e covered in relev ant p ortions o f the chapters in this te xt on

Developmental Psychology
Developmental psy cholog yis the scientific s tudy o f dev elopment acros s a lif espan. Dev elopmental
psychologis ts are interes ted in pro cesses rela ted to ph ysical ma tura tion . Ho wever, their f ocus is not limite d to
the ph ysical chang es as sociated with a ging , as the y also f ocus on chang es in c ognitiv e skills , moral re asoning ,
social b ehavior , and other ps ychologic al attributes .
Early dev elopmental ps ychologis ts focuse d primarily on chang es tha t occurre d through re aching adultho od,
providing enormous insight into the diff erenc es in ph ysical, cognitiv e, and so cial c apacities tha t exist between
very young children and adults . For ins tanc e, rese arch b y JeanPiaget(Figure 1.12 ) demons trated tha t very
young children do not demons trate object p ermanenc e. Object p ermanenc e ref ers to the unders tanding tha t
physical things c ontinue to e xist, even if the y are hidden from us . If y ou w ere to sho w an adult a to y, and then

While Pia get w as focuse d on c ognitiv e chang es during infancy and childho od as w e mo ve to adultho od, there is
an incre asing interes t in e xtending rese arch into the chang es tha t occur much la ter in lif e. This ma y be
reflectiv e of changing p opula tion demographics o f dev elop ed na tions as a whole . As more and more p eople liv e
long er liv es, the numb er o f people o f adv anced age will c ontinue to incre ase. Indee d, it is es tima ted tha t there
were jus t over 40 million p eople a ged 65 or older living in the Unite d Sta tes in 2010. Ho wever, by 2020, this
numb er is e xpecte d to incre ase to a bout 55 million . By the y ear 2050, it is es tima ted tha t ne arly 90 million
people in this c ountr y will b e 65 or older (Dep artment o f He alth and Human Ser vices, n.d.).
Personality Psychology
Personalit y psy cholog yfocuses on p atterns o f thoughts and b ehaviors tha t mak e each individual unique .
Several individuals (e .g., Freud and Maslo w) tha t we ha ve alre ady discus sed in our his toric al overview o f
psycholog y, and the Americ an ps ychologis t Gordon A llport, contribute d to e arly theories o f personality . These
early theoris ts attempte d to e xplain ho w an individual ’s personality dev elops from their giv en p ersp ectiv e. For
example , Freud prop osed tha t personality arose as c onflicts b etween the c onscious and unc onscious p arts of
the mind w ere c arrie d out o ver the lif espan. Specific ally, Freud theoriz ed tha t an individual w ent through
various ps ychose xual s tages o f dev elopment . According to F reud , adult p ersonality w ould result from the
resolution o f various c onflicts tha t centere d on the migra tion o f erog enous (or se xual ple asure -pro ducing )
zones from the oral (mouth) to the anus to the phallus to the g enitals . Lik e man y of Freud ’s theories , this
particular ide a was c ontro versial and did not lend itself to e xperimental tes ts (P erson , 1980).
More rec ently , the s tudy o f personality has tak en on a more quantita tive appro ach. Rather than e xplaining ho w
personality arises , rese arch is f ocuse d on identif ying personalit y traits , me asuring these traits , and
determining ho w these traits interact in a p articular c onte xt to determine ho w a p erson will b ehave in an y
given situa tion . Personality traits are rela tively c onsis tent p atterns o f thought and b ehavior , and man y ha ve
prop osed tha t fiv e trait dimensions are sufficient to c apture the v aria tions in p ersonality seen acros s
individuals . These fiv e dimensions are kno wn as the “Big F ive” or the Five Factor mo del, and include
dimensions o f conscientiousnes s, agree ablenes s, neuroticism , opennes s, and e xtra version ( Figure 1.13 ). Each
of these traits has b een demons trated to b e rela tively s table o ver the lif espan (e .g., Rantanen , Metsäp elto, Feldt ,
Pulkinnen , and K okko, 2007; Soldz & V aillant , 1999; McC rae & C osta, 2008) and is influenc ed by genetics (e .g.,
Jang , Liv esly , and V ernon , 1996).22 1 • Intr oduction t o Psycholog y

dimension c ould be described in opposit e terms .
Social Psychology
Social ps ycholog yfocuses on ho w w e interact with and rela te to others . Social ps ychologis ts conduct rese arch
on a wide v ariety o f topics tha t include diff erenc es in ho w w e explain our o wn b ehavior v ersus ho w w e explain
the b ehaviors o f others , prejudic e, and a ttraction , and ho w w e resolv e interp ersonal c onflicts . Social
psychologis ts ha ve also sought to determine ho w being among other p eople chang es our o wn b ehavior and
patterns o f thinking .
There are man y interes ting e xamples o f social ps ychologic al rese arch , and y ou will re ad a bout man y of these
in a la ter chapter o f this te xtbook. Until then , you will b e intro duced to one o f the mos t contro versial
psychologic al studies ev er conducte d. Stanle yMilgram was an Americ an so cial ps ychologis t who is mos t
famous f or rese arch tha t he c onducte d on ob edienc e. After the holo caust, in 1961, a N azi w ar criminal , Adolf
Eichmann , who w as ac cuse d of commit ting mas s atrocities , was put on trial . Man y people w ondere d ho w
German soldiers w ere c apable o f tor turing prisoners in c oncentra tion c amps , and the y were unsa tisfied with
the e xcuses giv en b y soldiers tha t the y were simply f ollowing orders . At the time , mos t psychologis ts agree d
that few p eople w ould b e willing to inflict such e xtraordinar y pain and suff ering , simply b ecause the y were
obeying orders . Milgram decide d to c onduct rese arch to determine whether or not this w as tr ue (Figure 1.14 ).
As y ou will re ad la ter in the te xt, Milgram f ound tha t ne arly tw o-thirds o f his p articip ants w ere willing to
deliv er wha t the y believ ed to b e lethal sho cks to another p erson , simply b ecause the y were ins tructe d to do so

those who pretend to b e particip ants in a rese arch s tudy who are actually w orking f or the rese archer and ha ve

Industrial-Organiz ational Psychology
Indus trial-Org aniza tional ps ycholog y(I-O ps ycholog y) is a subfield o f psycholog y tha t applies ps ychologic al
theories , principles , and rese arch findings in indus trial and org aniza tional set tings . I-O ps ychologis ts are o ften
involved in is sues rela ted to p ersonnel mana gement , org aniza tional s tructure , and w orkplac e en vironment .
Busines ses o ften seek the aid o f I-O ps ychologis ts to mak e the b est hiring decisions as w ell as to cre ate an

Health Psychology
Health ps ycholog yfocuses on ho w he alth is a ffecte d by the interaction o f biologic al, psychologic al, and
sociocultural factors . This p articular appro ach is kno wn as the biopsy choso cial mo del (Figure 1.15 ). He alth
psychologis ts are interes ted in helping individuals achiev e better he alth through public p olicy , educ ation ,
inter vention , and rese arch . He alth ps ychologis ts might c onduct rese arch tha t explores the rela tionship

Sport and Ex ercise Psychology
Researchers in sport and e xercise psy cholog ystudy the ps ychologic al asp ects o f sport performanc e,
including motiv ation and p erformanc e anxiety , and the eff ects o f sport on mental and emotional w ellb eing .
Research is also c onducte d on similar topics as the y rela te to ph ysical exercise in g eneral . The discipline also
includes topics tha t are bro ader than sp ort and e xercise but tha t are rela ted to interactions b etween mental
and ph ysical performanc e under demanding c onditions , such as fire fighting , militar y op erations , artistic
performanc e, and surg ery.
Clinical Psychology
Clinic al psy cholog yis the are a of psycholog y tha t focuses on the dia gnosis and tre atment o f psychologic al
disorders and other problema tic p atterns o f behavior . As such , it is g enerally c onsidere d to b e a more applie d
area within ps ycholog y; ho wever, some clinicians are also activ ely eng aged in scientific rese arch .Counseling
psycholog yis a similar discipline tha t focuses on emotional , social, vocational , and he alth-rela ted outc omes in
individuals who are c onsidere d ps ychologic ally he alth y.
As mentione d earlier , both F reud and R ogers pro vide d persp ectiv es tha t ha ve been influential in shaping ho w
clinicians interact with p eople seeking ps ychotherap y. While asp ects o f the ps ychoanalytic theor y are s till
found among some o f today’s therapis ts who are traine d from a ps ychodynamic p ersp ectiv e, Roger’s ide as
about client -centere dtherap yhave been esp ecially influential in shaping ho w man y clinicians op erate.
Furthermore , both b ehaviorism and the c ognitiv e rev olution ha ve shap ed clinic al practic e in the f orms o f
behavioral therap y, cognitiv e therap y, and c ognitiv e-behavioral therap y (Figure 1.16 ). Issues rela ted to the

Forensic Psychology
Forensic psy cholog yis a branch o f psycholog y tha t deals ques tions o f psycholog y as the y arise in the c onte xt
of the jus tice system . For e xample , forensic ps ychologis ts (and f orensic ps ychia trists) will as sess a p erson ’s
comp etency to s tand trial , assess the s tate of mind o f a def endant , act as c onsultants on child cus tody c ases ,
consult on sentencing and tre atment rec ommenda tions , and advise on is sues such as e yewitnes s tes timon y
and children ’s tes timon y (Americ an Bo ard o f Forensic P sycholog y, 2014). In these c apacities , the y will typic ally
act as e xpert witnes ses, called by either side in a c ourt case to pro vide their rese arch- or e xperienc e-based
opinions . As e xpert witnes ses, forensic ps ychologis ts mus t ha ve a g ood unders tanding o f the la w and pro vide
informa tion in the c onte xt of the leg al system ra ther than jus t within the re alm o f psycholog y. Forensic
psychologis ts are also use d in the jur y selection pro cess and witnes s prep aration . The y ma y also b e involved in
providing ps ychologic al tre atment within the criminal jus tice system . Criminal pro filers are a rela tively small

Psychologis ts can w ork in man y diff erent plac es doing man y diff erent things . In g eneral , anyone wishing to

cases , young scientis ts will c omplete one or tw o postdoctoral programs b efore applying f or a full-time faculty
position . Postdoctoral training programs allo w young scientis ts to fur ther dev elop their rese arch programs
and bro aden their rese arch skills under the sup ervision o f other pro fessionals in the field .
Car eer Options Outside of Academic Settings
Individuals who wish to b ecome practicing clinic al ps ychologis ts ha ve another option f or e arning a do ctoral
degree , which is kno wn as a P syD. APsyD is a do ctor o f psycholog y degree tha t is incre asingly p opular among
individuals interes ted in pursuing c areers in clinic al ps ycholog y. PsyD programs g enerally plac e les s emphasis
on rese arch-oriente d skills and f ocus more on applic ation o f psychologic al principles in the clinic al conte xt
(Norcros s & C astle, 2002).
Regardles s of whether e arning a PhD or P syD, in mos t states, an individual wishing to practic e as a lic ense d
clinic al or c ounseling ps ychologis t ma y complete p ostdoctoral w ork under the sup ervision o f a lic ense d
psychologis t. Within the las t few y ears, however, sev eral s tates ha ve begun to remo ve this re quirement , which
would allo w people to g et an e arlier s tart in their c areers (Munse y, 2009). After an individual has met the s tate
requirements , their cre dentials are ev alua ted to determine whether the y can sit f or the lic ensure e xam . Only
individuals tha t pass this e xam c an c all themselv es lic ense d clinic al or c ounseling ps ychologis ts (N orcros s,
n.d.). Lic ense d clinic al or c ounseling ps ychologis ts can then w ork in a numb er o f set tings , ranging from priv ate
clinic al practic e to hospital set tings . It should b e note d tha t clinic al ps ychologis ts and ps ychia trists do diff erent
things and rec eive diff erent typ es o f education . While b oth c an c onduct therap y and c ounseling , clinic al
psychologis ts ha ve a PhD or a P syD, where as ps ychia trists ha ve a do ctor o f me dicine degree (MD). As such ,
license d clinic al ps ychologis ts can adminis ter and interpret ps ychologic al tes ts, while ps ychia trists can
prescrib e me dications .
Individuals e arning a PhD c an w ork in a v ariety o f set tings , dep ending on their are as o f specializa tion . For
example , someone traine d as a biops ychologis t might w ork in a pharmac eutic al comp any to help tes t the
effic acy o f a new dr ug. Someone with a clinic al background might b ecome a f orensic ps ychologis t and w ork
within the leg al system to mak e rec ommenda tions during criminal trials and p arole he arings , or ser ve as an
expert in a c ourt case.
While e arning a do ctoral degree in ps ycholog y is a length y pro cess, usually taking b etween 5–6 y ears o f
gradua te study (DeAng elis, 2010), there are a numb er o f careers tha t can b e attaine d with a mas ter’s degree in
psycholog y. People who wish to pro vide ps ychotherap y can b ecome lic ense d to ser ve as v arious typ es o f
professional c ounselors (Ho ffman , 2012). R elev ant mas ter’s degrees are also sufficient f or individuals seeking
careers as scho ol ps ychologis ts (N ational As sociation o f Scho ol Psychologis ts, n.d.), in some c apacities rela ted
to sp ort psycholog y (Americ an P sychologic al As sociation , 2014), or as c onsultants in v arious indus trial

his e xperienc es. As the N azis c ame to p ower in German y, Wertheimer , Koffka, and K öhler immigra ted to the
Unite d Sta tes. Although the y left their la boratories and their rese arch b ehind , the y did intro duce Americ a to
Gestalt ide as. Some o f the principles o f Ges talt ps ycholog y are s till v ery influential in the s tudy o f sensa tion
and p erception .
One o f the mos t influential scho ols o f thought within ps ycholog y’s his tory was b ehaviorism . Beha viorism
focuse d on making ps ycholog y an objectiv e scienc e by studying o vert behavior and deemphasizing the
imp ortanc e of unobser vable mental pro cesses. John W atson is o ften c onsidere d the fa ther o f behaviorism , and

As b ehaviorism and ps ychoanalytic theor y took hold o f so man y asp ects o f psycholog y, some b egan to b ecome

During the 1950s , the landsc ape of psycholog y began to chang e. A scienc e of behavior b egan to shift b ack to its

1.3 Contempor ary Psychology
Psycholog y is a div erse discipline tha t is made up o f sev eral major sub divisions with unique p ersp ectiv es.
Biologic al ps ycholog y involves the s tudy o f the biologic al bases o f behavior . Sensa tion and p erception ref er to
the are a of psycholog y tha t is f ocuse d on ho w inf orma tion from our sensor y mo dalities is rec eived, and ho w
this inf orma tion is trans forme d into our p erceptual e xperienc es o f the w orld around us . Cognitiv e ps ycholog y
is concerne d with the rela tionship tha t exists between thought and b ehavior , and dev elopmental ps ychologis ts
study the ph ysical and c ognitiv e chang es tha t occur throughout one ’s lifespan. Personality ps ycholog y focuses
on individuals’ unique p atterns o f behavior , thought , and emotion . Indus trial and org aniza tional ps ycholog y,
health ps ycholog y, sport and e xercise ps ycholog y, forensic ps ycholog y, and clinic al ps ycholog y are all
considere d applie d are as o f psycholog y. Indus trial and org aniza tional ps ychologis ts apply ps ychologic al
concepts to I-O set tings . He alth ps ychologis ts lo ok for w ays to help p eople liv e he althier liv es, and clinic al
psycholog y involves the dia gnosis and tre atment o f psychologic al disorders and other problema tic b ehavioral
patterns . Sport and e xercise ps ychologis ts study the interactions b etween thoughts , emotions , and ph ysical
performanc e in sp orts, exercise , and other activities . Forensic ps ychologis ts carry out activities rela ted to
psycholog y in as sociation with the jus tice system .

Have you ev er w ondere d whether the violenc e you see on television a ffects y our b ehavior?
Are y ou more lik ely to b ehave aggres sively in re al lif e after w atching p eople b ehave violently in drama tic
situa tions on the screen? Or , could seeing fictional violenc e actually g et aggres sion out o f your s ystem , causing

interes ted in the rela tionship b etween b ehavior and e xposure to violent ima ges might ask these v ery
ques tions .
Sinc e ancient times , humans ha ve been c oncerne d about the eff ects o f new technologies on our b ehaviors and
thinking pro cesses. The Greek philosopher So crates, for e xample , worrie d tha t writing—a new technolog y at
that time —would diminish p eople ’s ability to rememb er b ecause the y could rely on writ ten rec ords ra ther than
commit ting inf orma tion to memor y. In our w orld o f rapidly changing technologies , ques tions a bout their
effects on our daily liv es and their resulting long-term imp acts c ontinue to emerg e. In addition to the imp act o f
screen time (on smar tphones , tablets , computers , and g aming ), technolog y is emerging in our v ehicles (such

LEARNING OBJEC TIVES
By the end o f this section, y ou wil l be able t o:
•Explain ho w scientific r esear ch addr esses ques tions about beha vior
•Discus s ho w scientific r esear ch g uides public policy
•Appr eciat e ho w scientific r esear ch can be impor tant in making personal decisions
Scientific rese arch is a critic al to ol for suc cessfully na vigating our c omple x world . Without it , we would b e
forced to rely solely on intuition , other p eople ’s authority , and blind luck . While man y of us f eel c onfident in
our a bilities to decipher and interact with the w orld around us , his tory is fille d with e xamples o f ho w very
wrong w e can b e when w e fail to rec ogniz e the nee d for evidenc e in supp orting claims . At various times in
history, we would ha ve been c ertain tha t the sun rev olved around a fla t earth, tha t the e arth’s continents did
not mo ve, and tha t mental illnes s was c aused by possession ( Figure 2.2 ). It is through s ystema tic scientific
rese arch tha t we div est ourselv es o f our prec onceived notions and sup erstitions and g ain an objectiv e
unders tanding o f ourselv es and our w orld .
FIGURE 2.2 Some o f our anc estors, acr oss the w orld and o ver the c enturies , belie ved that tr ephination—the
practic e of making a hole in the sk ull, as sho wn her e—allowed e vil spirits t o lea ve the body , thus curing mental
illnes s and other disor ders . (credit: “ taipr oject ”/Flickr)
The g oal of all scientis ts is to b etter unders tand the w orld around them . Psychologis ts focus their a ttention on
unders tanding b ehavior , as w ell as the c ognitiv e (mental) and ph ysiologic al (body) pro cesses tha t underlie
behavior . In c ontras t to other metho ds tha t people use to unders tand the b ehavior o f others , such as intuition
and p ersonal e xperienc e, the hallmark o f scientific rese arch is tha t there is evidenc e to supp ort a claim .
Scientific kno wledge is empiric al: It is grounde d in objectiv e, tangible evidenc e tha t can b e obser ved time and
time a gain, reg ardles s of who is obser ving .
While b ehavior is obser vable, the mind is not . If someone is cr ying , we can see b ehavior . Ho wever, the re ason
for the b ehavior is more difficult to determine . Is the p erson cr ying due to b eing sad , in p ain, or happ y?
Sometimes w e can le arn the re ason f or someone ’s behavior b y simply asking a ques tion , like “Why are y ou
crying? ” Ho wever, there are situa tions in which an individual is either unc omf ortable or un willing to ans wer
the ques tion hones tly, or is inc apable o f ans wering . For e xample , infants w ould not b e able to e xplain wh y the y
are cr ying . In such circums tanc es, the ps ychologis t mus t be cre ative in finding w ays to b etter unders tand
behavior . This chapter e xplores ho w scientific kno wledge is g enera ted, and ho w imp ortant tha t kno wledge is in
forming decisions in our p ersonal liv es and in the public domain .36 2 • P sychological R esear ch

Use of R esear ch Inf ormation
Trying to determine which theories are and are not ac cepte d by the scientific c ommunity c an b e difficult ,
especially in an are a of rese arch as bro ad as ps ycholog y. More than ev er b efore, we ha ve an incre dible amount
of inf orma tion a t our fing ertips , and a simple internet se arch on an y giv en rese arch topic might result in a
numb er o f contradictor y studies . In these c ases , we are witnes sing the scientific c ommunity g oing through the
process of reaching a c onsensus , and it c ould b e quite some time b efore a c onsensus emerg es. For e xample ,
the e xplosion in our use o f technolog y has le d rese archers to ques tion whether this ultima tely helps or hinders
us. The use and implementa tion o f technolog y in e duc ational set tings has b ecome widespre ad o ver the las t few
decades . Researchers are c oming to diff erent c onclusions reg arding the use o f technolog y. To illus trate this
point , a s tudy in vestigating a smar tphone app targ eting surg ery residents ( gradua te students in surg ery
training ) found tha t the use o f this app c an incre ase s tudent eng agement and raise tes t scores (Sha w & T an,
2015). C onversely , another s tudy f ound tha t the use o f technolog y in undergradua te student p opula tions had
negative imp acts on sleep , communic ation , and time mana gement skills (Mas simini & P eterson , 2009). Until
sufficient amounts o f rese arch ha ve been c onducte d, there will b e no cle ar consensus on the eff ects tha t
technolog y has on a s tudent 's ac quisition o f kno wledge, study skills , and mental he alth .
In the me antime , we should s trive to think critic ally a bout the inf orma tion w e enc ounter b y exercising a degree
of he alth y sk epticism . When someone mak es a claim , we should e xamine the claim from a numb er o f diff erent
persp ectiv es: wha t is the e xpertise o f the p erson making the claim , wha t might the y gain if the claim is v alid ,
does the claim seem jus tifie d giv en the evidenc e, and wha t do other rese archers think o f the claim? This is
especially imp ortant when w e consider ho w much inf orma tion in adv ertising c amp aigns and on the internet
claims to b e based on “ scientific evidenc e” when in actuality it is a b elief or p ersp ectiv e of jus t a few
individuals tr ying to sell a pro duct or dra w attention to their p ersp ectiv es.
We should b e inf orme d consumers o f the inf orma tion made a vailable to us b ecause decisions b ased on this
informa tion ha ve signific ant c onse quenc es. One such c onse quenc e can b e seen in p olitics and public p olicy .
Ima gine tha t you ha ve been electe d as the g overnor o f your s tate. One o f your resp onsibilities is to mana ge the
state budg et and determine ho w to b est spend y our c onstituents’ tax dollars . As the new g overnor , you nee d to

sound app ealing , you w ould w ant to b e sure tha t the y also pro ved eff ectiv e before in vesting additional mone y
in these programs . Fortuna tely, psychologis ts and other scientis ts ha ve conducte d vast amounts o f rese arch on
such programs and , in g eneral , the programs are f ound to b e eff ectiv e (N eil & Chris tensen , 2009; P eters -
Scheff er, Didden , Korzilius , & Sturme y, 2011). While not all programs are e qually eff ectiv e, and the shor t-term

NOTABLE RESEAR CHERS
Psychologic al rese arch has a long his tory involving imp ortant figures from div erse b ackgrounds . While the
intro ductor y chapter discus sed sev eral rese archers who made signific ant c ontributions to the discipline , there
are man y more individuals who deser ve attention in c onsidering ho w ps ycholog y has adv anced as a scienc e
through their w ork ( Figure 2.3 ). For ins tanc e, Marg aret Flo y Washburn (1871–1939) w as the firs t woman to

Francis Sumner (1895–1954) w as the firs t Afric an Americ an to rec eive a PhD in ps ycholog y in 1920. His
dissertation f ocuse d on is sues rela ted to ps ychoanaly sis. Sumner also had rese arch interes ts in racial bias and
educational jus tice. Sumner w as one o f the f ounders o f Ho ward Univ ersity ’s dep artment o f psycholog y, and
because o f his ac complishments , he is sometimes ref erre d to as the “F ather o f Black P sycholog y.” Thir teen

Although the es tablishment o f psycholog y’s scientific ro ots o ccurre d firs t in Europ e and the Unite d Sta tes, it
did not tak e much time until rese archers from around the w orld b egan to es tablish their o wn la boratories and
rese arch programs . For e xample , some o f the firs t experimental ps ycholog y laboratories in South Americ a
were f ounde d by Hora tio Piñero (1869–1919) a t two ins titutions in B uenos Aires , Arg entina (Go doy & Br ussino ,

The Pr ocess of Scientific R esear ch
Scientific kno wledge is adv anced through a pro cess kno wn as the scientific metho d. Basic ally, ide as (in the
form o f theories and h ypotheses) are tes ted agains t the re al w orld (in the f orm o f empiric al obser vations), and
those empiric al obser vations le ad to more ide as tha t are tes ted agains t the re al w orld , and so on . In this sense ,
the scientific pro cess is circular . The typ es o f reasoning within the circle are c alled de ductiv e and inductiv e. In
deduct ive re asoning , ide as are tes ted in the re al w orld; in induct ive re asoning , real-w orld obser vations le ad
to new ide as (Figure 2.4 ). These pro cesses are insep arable, like inhaling and e xhaling , but diff erent rese arch
appro aches plac e diff erent emphasis on the de ductiv e and inductiv e asp ects .
FIGURE 2.4 Psychological r esear ch relies on both inductiv e and deductiv e reasoning .
In the scientific c onte xt, deductiv e re asoning b egins with a g eneraliza tion— one h ypothesis —tha t is then use d
to re ach logic al conclusions a bout the re al w orld . If the h ypothesis is c orrect , then the logic al conclusions
reache d through de ductiv e re asoning should also b e correct . A de ductiv e re asoning argument might g o
something lik e this: A ll living things re quire energ y to sur vive (this w ould b e your h ypothesis). Ducks are living
things . Theref ore, ducks re quire energ y to sur vive (logic al conclusion). In this e xample , the h ypothesis is
correct; theref ore, the c onclusion is c orrect as w ell. Sometimes , however, an inc orrect h ypothesis ma y lead to a
logic al but inc orrect c onclusion . Consider this argument: all ducks are b orn with the a bility to see . Quack ers is
a duck . Theref ore, Quack ers w as b orn with the a bility to see . Scientis ts use de ductiv e re asoning to empiric ally
test their h ypotheses . Returning to the e xample o f the ducks , rese archers might design a s tudy to tes t the
hypothesis tha t if all living things re quire energ y to sur vive, then ducks will b e found to re quire energ y to

genera te hypotheses tha t are tes ted with de ductiv e re asoning . In the end , scienc e involves b oth de ductiv e and
inductiv e pro cesses.
For e xample , case s tudies , which y ou will re ad a bout in the ne xt section , are he avily w eighte d on the side o f
empiric al obser vations . Thus , case s tudies are closely as sociated with inductiv e pro cesses as rese archers
gather mas sive amounts o f obser vations and seek interes ting p atterns (new ide as) in the da ta. Exp erimental
rese arch , on the other hand , puts gre at emphasis on de ductiv e re asoning .
We’ve stated tha t theories and h ypotheses are ide as, but wha t sor t of ide as are the y, exactly? A theor yis a w ell-
develop ed set o f ide as tha t prop ose an e xplana tion f or obser ved phenomena. Theories are rep eatedly check ed
agains t the w orld , but the y tend to b e too comple x to b e tes ted all a t onc e; ins tead, rese archers cre ate
hypotheses to tes t specific asp ects o f a theor y.
Ahypothesis is a tes table pre diction a bout ho w the w orld will b ehave if our ide a is c orrect , and it is o ften
worde d as an if -then s tatement (e .g., if I s tudy all night , I will g et a p assing grade on the tes t). The h ypothesis is
extremely imp ortant b ecause it bridg es the g ap b etween the re alm o f ide as and the re al w orld . As sp ecific
hypotheses are tes ted, theories are mo difie d and refine d to reflect and inc orporate the result o f these tes ts

To see ho w this pro cess works , let’s consider a sp ecific theor y and a h ypothesis tha t might b e genera ted from
that theor y. As y ou’ll le arn in a la ter chapter , the J ames -Lang e theor y of emotion as serts tha t emotional

feeling o f fear. A h ypothesis tha t could b e deriv ed from this theor y might b e tha t a p erson who is una ware o f
the ph ysiologic al arousal tha t the sight o f the snak e elicits will not f eel f ear.
A scientific h ypothesis is also falsifiable , or c apable o f being sho wn to b e inc orrect . Recall from the
intro ductor y chapter tha t Sigmund Freud had lots o f interes ting ide as to e xplain v arious human b ehaviors
(Figure 2.6 ). Ho wever, a major criticism o f Freud ’s theories is tha t man y of his ide as are not falsifia ble; f or
example , it is imp ossible to ima gine empiric al obser vations tha t would dispro ve the e xistenc e of the id , the
ego, and the sup ereg o—the three elements o f personality describ ed in F reud ’s theories . Despite this , Freud ’s
theories are widely ta ught in intro ductor y ps ycholog y texts b ecause o f their his toric al signific ance for
personality ps ycholog y and ps ychotherap y, and these remain the ro ot of all mo dern f orms o f therap y.
FIGURE 2.6 Man y of the specifics o f (a) F reud's theories , such as (b) his division o f the mind int o id, eg o, and
super ego, have fal len out o f favor in r ecent decades because the y are not falsifiable . In br oader s trokes, his vie ws
set the s tage for much o f psychological thinking t oday, such as the unc onscious natur e of the majority o f
psychological pr ocesses.
In contras t, the J ames -Lang e theor y do es g enera te falsifia ble h ypotheses , such as the one describ ed above.
Some individuals who suff er signific ant injuries to their spinal c olumns are una ble to f eel the b odily chang es
that often ac comp any emotional e xperienc es. Theref ore, we could tes t the h ypothesis b y determining ho w
emotional e xperienc es diff er b etween individuals who ha ve the a bility to detect these chang es in their
physiologic al arousal and those who do not . In fact , this rese arch has b een c onducte d and while the emotional
experienc es o f people depriv ed of an a warenes s of their ph ysiologic al arousal ma y be les s intense , the y still

Scientific rese arch ’s dep endenc e on falsifia bility allo ws for gre at confidenc e in the inf orma tion tha t it

Each o f these rese arch metho ds has unique s trengths and w eaknes ses, and e ach metho d ma y only b e
appropria te for c ertain typ es o f rese arch ques tions . For e xample , studies tha t rely primarily on obser vation

somewha t limite d because o f small sample siz es. Sur vey rese arch , on the other hand , allo ws rese archers to
easily c ollect da ta from rela tively larg e samples . While this allo ws for results to b e generaliz ed to the larg er
popula tion more e asily , the inf orma tion tha t can b e collecte d on an y giv en sur vey is somewha t limite d and
subject to problems as sociated with an y typ e of self -rep orted da ta. Some rese archers c onduct archiv al

insight into a numb er o f rese arch ques tions , rese archers using this appro ach ha ve no c ontrol on ho w or wha t

Correla tional rese arch c an find a rela tionship b etween tw o varia bles , but the only w ay a rese archer c an claim

In addition , man y of the ques tions tha t psychologis ts w ould lik e to ans wer cannot b e pursue d through

Clinical or Case Studies
In 2011, the New Y ork Times publishe d a f eature s tory on K rista and T atiana Hog an, Canadian twin girls .
These p articular twins are unique b ecause K rista and T atiana are c onjoine d twins , connecte d at the he ad.
There is evidenc e tha t the tw o girls are c onnecte d in a p art of the brain c alled the thalamus , which is a major
sensor y rela y center . Mos t inc oming sensor y inf orma tion is sent through the thalamus b efore re aching higher

The implic ations o f this p otential c onnection me an tha t it might b e possible f or one twin to e xperienc e the
sensa tions o f the other twin . For ins tanc e, if K rista is w atching a p articularly funn y television program , Tatiana
might smile or la ugh ev en if she is not w atching the program . This p articular p ossibility has pique d the
interes t of man y neuroscientis ts who seek to unders tand ho w the brain uses sensor y inf orma tion .
These twins represent an enormous resourc e in the s tudy o f the brain , and sinc e their c ondition is v ery rare , it
is lik ely tha t as long as their family a grees , scientis ts will f ollow these girls v ery closely throughout their liv es to
gain as much inf orma tion as p ossible (Dominus , 2011).
Over time , it has b ecome cle ar tha t while K rista and T atiana share some sensor y experienc es and motor

In obser vational rese arch , scientis ts are c onducting a clinic alorcase s tudy when the y focus on one p erson or

a precious amount o f insight into those c ases . The richnes s of inf orma tion tha t is c ollecte d in clinic al or c ase

unders tanding o f the individuals and the p articular phenomenon b eing s tudie d.
If clinic al or c ase s tudies pro vide so much inf orma tion , wh y are the y not more fre quent among rese archers?
As it turns out , the major b enefit o f this p articular appro ach is also a w eaknes s. As mentione d earlier , this

Natur alistic Observ ation
If you w ant to unders tand ho w behavior o ccurs , one o f the b est ways to g ain inf orma tion is to simply obser ve
the b ehavior in its na tural c onte xt. Ho wever, people might chang e their b ehavior in une xpecte d ways if the y
kno w the y are b eing obser ved. Ho w do rese archers obtain ac cura te inf orma tion when p eople tend to hide their
natural b ehavior? As an e xample , ima gine tha t your pro fessor asks ev eryone in y our clas s to raise their hand if
they alw ays wash their hands a fter using the res troom. Chanc es are tha t almos t everyone in the clas sroom will
raise their hand , but do y ou think hand w ashing a fter ev ery trip to the res troom is re ally tha t univ ersal?
This is v ery similar to the phenomenon mentione d earlier in this chapter: man y individuals do not f eel
comf ortable ans wering a ques tion hones tly. But if w e are c ommit ted to finding out the facts a bout hand
washing , we ha ve other options a vailable to us .
Supp ose w e send a clas sma te into the res troom to actually w atch whether ev eryone w ashes their hands a fter
using the res troom. Will our obser ver blend into the res troom en vironment b y wearing a white la b coat, sitting
with a clipb oard, and s taring a t the sinks? W e want our rese archer to b e inc onspicuous —perhaps s tanding a t
one o f the sinks pretending to put in c ontact lenses while secretly rec ording the relev ant inf orma tion . This
type of obser vational s tudy is c allednaturalis tic obser vation: obser ving b ehavior in its na tural set ting . To
better unders tand p eer e xclusion , Suzanne F anger collaborated with c olleagues a t the Univ ersity o f Texas to
obser ve the b ehavior o f prescho ol children on a pla yground . Ho w did the obser vers remain inc onspicuous
over the dura tion o f the s tudy? The y equipp ed a f ew o f the children with wireles s microphones ( which the
children quickly f orgot about) and obser ved while taking notes from a dis tanc e. Also, the children in tha t
particular prescho ol (a “la boratory prescho ol”) w ere ac custome d to ha ving obser vers on the pla yground
(Fanger, Frank el, & Haz en, 2012).
It is critic al tha t the obser ver b e as unobtr usiv e and as inc onspicuous as p ossible: when p eople kno w the y are
being w atche d, the y are les s lik ely to b ehave na turally . If y ou ha ve an y doubt a bout this , ask y ourself ho w your
driving b ehavior might diff er in tw o situa tions: In the firs t situa tion , you are driving do wn a deser ted high way
during the middle o f the da y; in the sec ond situa tion , you are b eing f ollowed by a p olice car do wn the same
deser ted high way (Figure 2.7 ).2.2 • Appr oaches t o Resear ch 43

It should b e pointe d out tha t na turalis tic obser vation is not limite d to rese arch in volving humans . Indee d,
some o f the b est-kno wn e xamples o f na turalis tic obser vation in volve rese archers g oing into the field to
obser ve various kinds o f animals in their o wn en vironments . As with human s tudies , the rese archers maintain
their dis tanc e and a void inter fering with the animal subjects so as not to influenc e their na tural b ehaviors .
Scientis ts ha ve use d this technique to s tudy so cial hierarchies and interactions among animals ranging from
ground squirrels to g orillas . The inf orma tion pro vide d by these s tudies is in valua ble in unders tanding ho w
those animals org aniz e so cially and c ommunic ate with one another . The anthrop ologis t Jane Goodall , for
example , spent ne arly fiv e dec ades obser ving the b ehavior o f chimp anzees in Afric a (Figure 2.8 ). As an
illus tration o f the typ es o f concerns tha t a rese archer might enc ounter in na turalis tic obser vation , some
scientis ts criticiz ed Go odall f or giving the chimps names ins tead o f ref erring to them b y numb ers—using
names w as thought to undermine the emotional detachment re quire d for the objectivity o f the s tudy (McKie ,
2010).

The gre atest benefit o f na turalis tic obser vation is the validity , or ac curacy , of inf orma tion c ollecte d
unobtr usiv ely in a na tural set ting . Ha ving individuals b ehave as the y normally w ould in a giv en situa tion
means tha t we ha ve a higher degree o f ecologic al validity , or re alism , than w e might achiev e with other
rese arch appro aches . Theref ore, our a bility to g eneraliz e the findings o f the rese arch to re al-w orld situa tions is
enhanc ed. If done c orrectly , we nee d not w orry about p eople or animals mo difying their b ehavior simply
because the y are b eing obser ved. Sometimes , people ma y as sume tha t reality programs giv e us a glimpse into
authentic human b ehavior . Ho wever, the principle o f inc onspicuous obser vation is viola ted as re ality s tars are
followed by camera crew s and are inter view ed on c amera f or p ersonal c onfessionals . Giv en tha t en vironment ,
we mus t doubt ho w na tural and re alistic their b ehaviors are .
The major do wnside o f na turalis tic obser vation is tha t the y are o ften difficult to set up and c ontrol . In our
restroom s tudy , wha t if y ou s tood in the res troom all da y prep ared to rec ord p eople ’s hand w ashing b ehavior
and no one c ame in? Or , wha t if y ou ha ve been closely obser ving a tro op o f gorillas f or w eeks only to find tha t
they migra ted to a new plac e while y ou w ere sleeping in y our tent? The b enefit o f realistic da ta comes a t a c ost.

Sometimes s tudies in volve structure d obser vation . In these c ases , people are obser ved while eng aging in set ,
specific tasks . An e xcellent e xample o f structure d obser vation c omes from Strang e Situa tion b y Mar y
Ains worth (you will re ad more a bout this in the chapter on lif espan dev elopment). The Strang e Situa tion is a
procedure use d to ev alua te attachment s tyles tha t exist between an infant and c aregiv er. In this sc enario ,
caregiv ers bring their infants into a ro om fille d with to ys. The Strang e Situa tion in volves a numb er o f phases ,
including a s trang er coming into the ro om, the c aregiv er le aving the ro om, and the c aregiv er’s return to the
room. The infant ’s behavior is closely monitore d at each phase , but it is the b ehavior o f the infant up on b eing
reunite d with the c aregiv er tha t is mos t telling in terms o f characterizing the infant ’s attachment s tyle with the
caregiv er.
Another p otential problem in obser vational rese arch is obser ver bias . Generally , people who act as obser vers
are closely in volved in the rese arch project and ma y unc onsciously sk ew their obser vations to fit their
rese arch g oals or e xpecta tions . To protect a gains t this typ e of bias , rese archers should ha ve cle ar criteria
establishe d for the typ es o f behaviors rec orde d and ho w those b ehaviors should b e clas sifie d. In addition ,
rese archers o ften c omp are obser vations o f the same ev ent b y multiple obser vers, in order to tes tinter -rater
reliabilit y: a me asure o f relia bility tha t assesses the c onsis tency o f obser vations b y diff erent obser vers.
Surveys

Surveys allo w rese archers to g ather da ta from larg er samples than ma y be afforde d by other rese arch

individuals tha t the rese archers are interes ted in . Researchers s tudy the sample and seek to g eneraliz e their
findings to the p opula tion . Generally , rese archers will b egin this pro cess by calcula ting v arious me asures o f
central tendency from the da ta the y ha ve collecte d. These me asures pro vide an o verall summar y of wha t a

There is b oth s trength and w eaknes s of the sur vey in c omp arison to c ase s tudies . By using sur veys, we can
collect inf orma tion from a larg er sample o f people . A larg er sample is b etter a ble to reflect the actual div ersity

with more c ertainty than the inf orma tion c ollecte d through a c ase s tudy . Ho wever, giv en the gre ater numb er o f

Archiv al R esear ch
Some rese archers g ain ac cess to larg e amounts o f data without interacting with a single rese arch p articip ant.

In comp aring archiv al rese arch to other rese arch metho ds, there are sev eral imp ortant dis tinctions . For one ,
the rese archer emplo ying archiv al rese arch nev er directly interacts with rese arch p articip ants . Theref ore, the
investment o f time and mone y to c ollect da ta is c onsidera bly les s with archiv al rese arch . Additionally ,
rese archers ha ve no c ontrol o ver wha t inf orma tion w as originally c ollecte d. Theref ore, rese arch ques tions
have to b e tailore d so the y can b e ans wered within the s tructure o f the e xisting da ta sets . There is also no

segments o f the p opula tion a t the same time . Using the dietar y ha bits e xample a bove, the rese archer might
directly c omp are diff erent groups o f people b y age. Ins tead o f studying a group o f people f or 20 y ears to see
how their dietar y ha bits chang ed from dec ade to dec ade, the rese archer w ould s tudy a group o f 20- year-old
individuals and c omp are them to a group o f 30- year-old individuals and a group o f 40- year-old individuals .
While cros s-sectional rese arch re quires a shor ter-term in vestment , it is also limite d by diff erenc es tha t exist
between the diff erent g enera tions (or c ohor ts) tha t ha ve nothing to do with a ge per se , but ra ther reflect the
social and cultural e xperienc es o f diff erent g enera tions o f individuals mak e them diff erent from one another .
To illus trate this c oncept, consider the f ollowing sur vey findings . In rec ent y ears there has b een signific ant
growth in the p opular supp ort of same -sex marria ge. Man y studies on this topic bre ak do wn sur vey
particip ants into diff erent a ge groups . In g eneral , young er p eople are more supp ortive of same -sex marria ge
than are those who are older (J ones , 2013). Do es this me an tha t as w e age we become les s op en to the ide a of
same -sex marria ge, or do es this me an tha t older individuals ha ve diff erent p ersp ectiv es b ecause o f the so cial
clima tes in which the y grew up? Longitudinal rese arch is a p owerful appro ach b ecause the same individuals
are in volved in the rese arch project o ver time , which me ans tha t the rese archers nee d to b e les s concerne d
with diff erenc es among c ohor ts affecting the results o f their s tudy .
Often longitudinal s tudies are emplo yed when rese arching v arious dise ases in an eff ort to unders tand
particular risk factors . Such s tudies o ften in volve tens o f thousands o f individuals who are f ollowed for sev eral
decades . Giv en the enormous numb er o f people in volved in these s tudies , rese archers c an f eel c onfident tha t
their findings c an b e generaliz ed to the larg er p opula tion . The C ancer P revention Study -3 (CPS -3) is one o f a
series o f longitudinal s tudies sp onsore d by the Americ an C ancer So ciety aime d at determining pre dictiv e risk
factors as sociated with c ancer. When p articip ants enter the s tudy , the y complete a sur vey about their liv es and
family his tories , pro viding inf orma tion on factors tha t might c ause or prev ent the dev elopment o f cancer. Then
every few y ears the p articip ants rec eive additional sur veys to c omplete . In the end , hundre ds o f thousands o f
particip ants will b e track ed over 20 y ears to determine which o f them dev elop c ancer and which do not .
Clearly , this typ e of rese arch is imp ortant and p otentially v ery inf orma tive. For ins tanc e, earlier longitudinal
studies sp onsore d by the Americ an C ancer So ciety pro vide d some o f the firs t scientific demons trations o f the
now w ell-es tablishe d links b etween incre ased ra tes o f cancer and smoking (Americ an C ancer So ciety , n.d.)

As with an y rese arch s trategy, longitudinal rese arch is not without limita tions . For one , these s tudies re quire
an incre dible time in vestment b y the rese archer and rese arch p articip ants . Giv en tha t some longitudinal
studies tak e years, if not dec ades , to c omplete , the results will not b e kno wn f or a c onsidera ble p erio d of time .
In addition to the time demands , these s tudies also re quire a subs tantial financial in vestment . Man y
rese archers are una ble to c ommit the resourc es nec essary to see a longitudinal project through to the end .
Research p articip ants mus t also b e willing to c ontinue their p articip ation f or an e xtende d perio d of time , and
this c an b e problema tic. People mo ve, get marrie d and tak e new names , get ill , and ev entually die . Even
without signific ant lif e chang es, some p eople ma y simply cho ose to disc ontinue their p articip ation in the
project . As a result , the attrit ion rates, or re duction in the numb er o f rese arch p articip ants due to drop outs , in
longitudinal s tudies are quite high and incre ases o ver the c ourse o f a project . For this re ason , rese archers
using this appro ach typic ally recr uit man y particip ants fully e xpecting tha t a subs tantial numb er will drop out
before the end . As the s tudy progres ses, the y continually check whether the sample s till represents the larg er
popula tion , and mak e adjus tments as nec essary.

Did y ou kno w tha t as sales in ic e cre am incre ase, so do es the o verall ra te of crime? Is it p ossible tha t indulging
in your fa vorite fla vor o f ice cre am c ould send y ou on a crime spree? Or , after c ommit ting crime do y ou think
you might decide to tre at yourself to a c one? There is no ques tion tha t a rela tionship e xists between ic e cre am
and crime (e .g., Harp er, 2013), but it w ould b e pret ty foolish to decide tha t one thing actually c aused the other
to occur.
It is much more lik ely tha t both ic e cre am sales and crime ra tes are rela ted to the temp erature outside . When
the temp erature is w arm , there are lots o f people out o f their houses , interacting with e ach other , getting
anno yed with one another , and sometimes c ommit ting crimes . Also, when it is w arm outside , we are more
likely to seek a c ool tre at lik e ice cre am. Ho w do w e determine if there is indee d a rela tionship b etween tw o
things? And when there is a rela tionship , how can w e disc ern whether it is a ttributa ble to c oincidenc e or
causation?
Corr elational R esear ch
Correlat ion means tha t there is a rela tionship b etween tw o or more v aria bles (such as ic e cre am c onsumption
and crime), but this rela tionship do es not nec essarily imply c ause and eff ect. When tw o varia bles are48 2 • P sychological R esear ch

correla ted, it simply me ans tha t as one v aria ble chang es, so do es the other . We can me asure c orrela tion b y
calcula ting a s tatistic kno wn as a c orrela tion c oefficient . Acorrelat ion c oefficient is a numb er from -1 to +1
that indic ates the s trength and direction o f the rela tionship b etween v aria bles . The c orrela tion c oefficient is
usually represente d by the let terr.
The numb er p ortion o f the c orrela tion c oefficient indic ates the s trength o f the rela tionship . The closer the
numb er is to 1 ( be it neg ative or p ositiv e), the more s trongly rela ted the v aria bles are , and the more pre dicta ble
chang es in one v aria ble will b e as the other v aria ble chang es. The closer the numb er is to z ero, the w eaker the
rela tionship , and the les s pre dicta ble the rela tionships b etween the v aria bles b ecomes . For ins tanc e, a
correla tion c oefficient o f 0.9 indic ates a far s trong er rela tionship than a c orrela tion c oefficient o f 0.3. If the
varia bles are not rela ted to one another a t all , the c orrela tion c oefficient is 0. The e xample a bove about ic e
cream and crime is an e xample o f two varia bles tha t we might e xpect to ha ve no rela tionship to e ach other .
The sign—p ositiv e or neg ative—of the c orrela tion c oefficient indic ates the direction o f the rela tionship ( Figure
2.12 ). A posit ive correlat ion means tha t the v aria bles mo ve in the same direction . Put another w ay, it me ans
that as one v aria ble incre ases so do es the other , and c onversely , when one v aria ble decre ases so do es the other .
Aneg ative correlat ion means tha t the v aria bles mo ve in opp osite directions . If tw o varia bles are neg atively
correla ted, a decre ase in one v aria ble is as sociated with an incre ase in the other and vic e versa.
The e xample o f ice cre am and crime ra tes is a p ositiv e correla tion b ecause b oth v aria bles incre ase when
temp eratures are w armer . Other e xamples o f positiv e correla tions are the rela tionship b etween an individual ’s
height and w eight or the rela tionship b etween a p erson ’s age and numb er o f wrinkles . One might e xpect a
negative correla tion to e xist between someone ’s tire dnes s during the da y and the numb er o f hours the y slept
the previous night: the amount o f sleep decre ases as the f eelings o f tire dnes s incre ase. In a re al-w orld e xample
of neg ative correla tion , student rese archers a t the Univ ersity o f Minnesota f ound a w eak neg ative correla tion ( r
= -0.29) b etween the a verage numb er o f days per w eek tha t students g ot fewer than 5 hours o f sleep and their
GPA (Lo wry, De an, & Manders , 2010). K eep in mind tha t a neg ative correla tion is not the same as no
correla tion . For e xample , we would prob ably find no c orrela tion b etween hours o f sleep and sho e siz e.
As mentione d earlier , correla tions ha ve pre dictiv e value . Ima gine tha t you are on the admis sions c ommit tee o f
a major univ ersity . You are fac ed with a hug e numb er o f applic ations , but y ou are a ble to ac commo date only a
small p ercenta ge of the applic ant p ool. Ho w might y ou decide who should b e admit ted? Y ou might tr y to
correla te your current s tudents’ c olleg e GP A with their sc ores on s tandardiz ed tes ts lik e the S AT or A CT. By
obser ving which c orrela tions w ere s trong est for y our current s tudents , you c ould use this inf orma tion to
predict rela tive suc cess of those s tudents who ha ve applie d for admis sion into the univ ersity .

Corr elation Does Not Indicate Causation
Correla tional rese arch is useful b ecause it allo ws us to disc over the s trength and direction o f rela tionships tha t
exist between tw o varia bles . Ho wever, correla tion is limite d because es tablishing the e xistenc e of a
rela tionship tells us lit tle a bout cause and eff ect. While v aria bles are sometimes c orrela ted because one do es
cause the other , it c ould also b e tha t some other factor , aconfounding v ariable , is actually c ausing the
systema tic mo vement in our v aria bles o f interes t. In the ic e cre am/crime ra te example mentione d earlier ,
temp erature is a c onfounding v aria ble tha t could ac count f or the rela tionship b etween the tw o varia bles .
Even when w e cannot p oint to cle ar confounding v aria bles , we should not as sume tha t a c orrela tion b etween
two varia bles implies tha t one v aria ble c auses chang es in another . This c an b e frustrating when a c ause-and-
effect rela tionship seems cle ar and intuitiv e. Think b ack to our discus sion o f the rese arch done b y the
Americ an C ancer So ciety and ho w their rese arch projects w ere some o f the firs t demons trations o f the link
between smoking and c ancer. It seems re asona ble to as sume tha t smoking c auses c ancer, but if w e were
limite d to correla tional rese arch , we would b e overstepping our b ounds b y making this as sumption .
Unfortuna tely, people mis takenly mak e claims o f causation as a function o f correla tions all the time . Such
claims are esp ecially c ommon in adv ertisements and new s stories . For e xample , rec ent rese arch f ound tha t
people who e at cereal on a regular b asis achiev e he althier w eights than those who rarely e at cereal (F rantz en,
Treviño , Echon , Garcia-Dominic , & DiMarc o, 2013; Bar ton et al ., 2005). Gues s ho w the c ereal comp anies rep ort
this finding . Do es e ating c ereal re ally c ause an individual to maintain a he alth y weight , or are there other
possible e xplana tions , such as , someone a t a he alth y weight is more lik ely to regularly e at a he alth y bre akfas t
than someone who is ob ese or someone who a voids me als in an a ttempt to diet ( Figure 2.13 )? While
correla tional rese arch is in valua ble in identif ying rela tionships among v aria bles , a major limita tion is the
inability to es tablish c ausality . Psychologis ts w ant to mak e statements a bout c ause and eff ect, but the only w ay
to do tha t is to c onduct an e xperiment to ans wer a rese arch ques tion . The ne xt section describ es ho w scientific
experiments inc orporate metho ds tha t elimina te, or c ontrol f or, alterna tive explana tions , which allo w

Illusory Corr elations
The tempta tion to mak e erroneous c ause-and-eff ect s tatements b ased on c orrela tional rese arch is not the only
way we tend to misinterpret da ta. W e also tend to mak e the mis take of illusor y correla tions , esp ecially with
uns ystema tic obser vations .Illusor y correlat ions , or false c orrela tions , occur when p eople b eliev e tha t
rela tionships e xist between tw o things when no such rela tionship e xists. One w ell-kno wn illusor y correla tion
is the supp osed eff ect tha t the mo on’s phases ha ve on human b ehavior . Man y people p assiona tely as sert tha t
human b ehavior is a ffecte d by the phase o f the mo on, and sp ecific ally, tha t people act s trang ely when the

moon is full ( Figure 2.14 ).
FIGURE 2.14 Man y people belie ve that a ful l moon mak es people beha ve oddl y. (credit: Cor y Zank er)
There is no den ying tha t the mo on e xerts a p owerful influenc e on our planet . The ebb and flo w of the o cean’s
tides are tightly tie d to the gra vitational f orces o f the mo on. Man y people b eliev e, theref ore, tha t it is logic al
that we are a ffecte d by the mo on as w ell. After all , our b odies are larg ely made up o f water. A meta-analy sis o f
nearly 40 s tudies c onsis tently demons trated, however, tha t the rela tionship b etween the mo on and our
behavior do es not e xist (Rotton & K elly, 1985). While w e ma y pay more a ttention to o dd b ehavior during the full
phase o f the mo on, the ra tes o f odd b ehavior remain c onstant throughout the lunar cy cle.
Why are w e so apt to b eliev e in illusor y correla tions lik e this? Often w e re ad or he ar a bout them and simply
accept the inf orma tion as v alid . Or, we ha ve a hunch a bout ho w something w orks and then lo ok for evidenc e to
supp ort tha t hunch , ignoring evidenc e tha t would tell us our hunch is false; this is kno wn as confirmat ion
bias . Other times , we find illusor y correla tions b ased on the inf orma tion tha t comes mos t easily to mind , even
if tha t inf orma tion is sev erely limite d. And while w e ma y feel c onfident tha t we can use these rela tionships to
better unders tand and pre dict the w orld around us , illusor y correla tions c an ha ve signific ant dra wbacks . For
example , rese arch sugg ests tha t illusor y correla tions —in which c ertain b ehaviors are inac cura tely a ttribute d to
certain groups —are in volved in the f orma tion o f prejudicial a ttitudes tha t can ultima tely le ad to discrimina tory
behavior (F iedler , 2004).
Causality : Conducting Experiments and Using the Data
As y ou’ve learne d, the only w ay to es tablish tha t there is a c ause-and-eff ect rela tionship b etween tw o varia bles
is to c onduct a scientific experiment . Exp eriment has a diff erent me aning in the scientific c onte xt than in
everyday life. In ev eryday conversa tion , we often use it to describ e trying something f or the firs t time , such as
experimenting with a new hair s tyle or a new f ood. Ho wever, in the scientific c onte xt, an e xperiment has
precise re quirements f or design and implementa tion .
The Experimental Hypothesis
In order to c onduct an e xperiment , a rese archer mus t ha ve a sp ecific hypothesis to b e tes ted. As y ou’ve
learne d, hypotheses c an b e formula ted either through direct obser vation o f the re al w orld or a fter c areful
review o f previous rese arch . For e xample , if y ou think tha t the use o f technolog y in the clas sroom has neg ative
imp acts on le arning , then y ou ha ve basic ally f ormula ted a h ypothesis —namely , tha t the use o f technolog y in
the clas sroom should b e limite d because it decre ases le arning . Ho w might y ou ha ve arriv ed at this p articular
hypothesis? Y ou ma y ha ve notic ed tha t your clas sma tes who tak e notes on their laptops p erform a t lower lev els
on clas s exams than those who tak e notes b y hand , or those who rec eive a les son via a c omputer program
versus via an in-p erson te acher ha ve diff erent lev els o f performanc e when tes ted (Figure 2.15 ).2.3 • Anal yzing Findings 51
FIGURE 2.15 How might the use o f technolog y in the clas sroom impact learning? (cr edit: modification o f work b y

These sor ts of personal obser vations are wha t often le ad us to f ormula te a sp ecific h ypothesis , but w e cannot
use limite d personal obser vations and anec dotal evidenc e to rig orously tes t our h ypothesis . Ins tead, to find out
if re al-w orld da ta supp orts our h ypothesis , we ha ve to c onduct an e xperiment .
Designing an Experiment
The mos t basic e xperimental design in volves tw o groups: the e xperimental group and the c ontrol group . The
two groups are designe d to b e the same e xcept f or one diff erenc e— experimental manipula tion . The
experimental group gets the e xperimental manipula tion—tha t is, the tre atment or v aria ble b eing tes ted (in
this c ase, the use o f technolog y)—and the control group does not . Sinc e experimental manipula tion is the only
differenc e between the e xperimental and c ontrol groups , we can b e sure tha t an y diff erenc es b etween the tw o
are due to e xperimental manipula tion ra ther than chanc e.
In our e xample o f ho w the use o f technolog y should b e limite d in the clas sroom, we ha ve the e xperimental
group le arn alg ebra using a c omputer program and then tes t their le arning . We me asure the le arning in our
control group a fter the y are ta ught alg ebra b y a te acher in a traditional clas sroom. It is imp ortant f or the
control group to b e tre ated similarly to the e xperimental group , with the e xception tha t the c ontrol group do es
not rec eive the e xperimental manipula tion .
We also nee d to precisely define , or op erationaliz e, how w e me asure le arning o f alg ebra. An operat ional
definit ion is a precise description o f our v aria bles , and it is imp ortant in allo wing others to unders tand e xactly
how and wha t a rese archer me asures in a p articular e xperiment . In op erationalizing le arning , we might
choose to lo ok a t performanc e on a tes t covering the ma terial on which the individuals w ere ta ught b y the
teacher or the c omputer program . We might also ask our p articip ants to summariz e the inf orma tion tha t was
just presente d in some w ay. Wha tever w e determine , it is imp ortant tha t we op erationaliz e learning in such a
way tha t an yone who he ars a bout our s tudy f or the firs t time kno ws exactly wha t we me an b y learning . This
aids p eoples’ a bility to interpret our da ta as w ell as their c apacity to rep eat our e xperiment should the y cho ose
to do so .
Onc e we ha ve op erationaliz ed wha t is c onsidere d use o f technolog y and wha t is c onsidere d learning in our
experiment p articip ants , we nee d to es tablish ho w w e will r un our e xperiment . In this c ase, we might ha ve
particip ants sp end 45 minutes le arning alg ebra (either through a c omputer program or with an in-p erson
math te acher) and then giv e them a tes t on the ma terial c overed during the 45 minutes .52 2 • P sychological R esear ch
Access for fr ee a t opens tax. org
Ideally, the p eople who sc ore the tes ts are una ware o f who w as as signe d to the e xperimental or c ontrol group ,
in order to c ontrol f or e xperimenter bias .Exp erimenter bias refers to the p ossibility tha t a rese archer ’s
expecta tions might sk ew the results o f the s tudy . Rememb er, conducting an e xperiment re quires a lot o f
planning , and the p eople in volved in the rese arch project ha ve a v ested interes t in supp orting their
hypotheses . If the obser vers knew which child w as in which group , it might influenc e ho w the y interpret
ambiguous resp onses , such as slopp y handwriting or minor c omputa tional mis takes. By being blind to which
child is in which group , we protect a gains t those biases . This situa tion is a single -blind s tudy , me aning tha t
one o f the groups (p articip ants) are una ware as to which group the y are in (e xperiment or c ontrol group) while
the rese archer who dev elop ed the e xperiment kno ws which p articip ants are in e ach group .
In a double -blind s tudy , both the rese archers and the p articip ants are blind to group as signments . Wh y would
a rese archer w ant to r un a s tudy where no one kno ws who is in which group? Bec ause b y doing so , we can
control f or b oth e xperimenter and p articip ant e xpecta tions . If y ou are familiar with the phrase plac ebo eff ect,
you alre ady ha ve some ide a as to wh y this is an imp ortant c onsidera tion . The plac ebo eff ect o ccurs when
people 's expecta tions or b eliefs influenc e or determine their e xperienc e in a giv en situa tion . In other w ords ,
simply e xpecting something to happ en c an actually mak e it happ en.
The plac ebo eff ect is c ommonly describ ed in terms o f tes ting the eff ectiv enes s of a new me dication . Ima gine
that you w ork in a pharmac eutic al comp any, and y ou think y ou ha ve a new dr ug tha t is eff ectiv e in tre ating
depres sion . To demons trate tha t your me dication is eff ectiv e, you r un an e xperiment with tw o groups: The
experimental group rec eives the me dication , and the c ontrol group do es not . But you don ’t want p articip ants
to kno w whether the y rec eived the dr ug or not .
Why is tha t? Ima gine tha t you are a p articip ant in this s tudy , and y ou ha ve jus t tak en a pill tha t you think will
impro ve your mo od. Bec ause y ou e xpect the pill to ha ve an eff ect, you might f eel b etter simply b ecause y ou
took the pill and not b ecause o f an y dr ug actually c ontaine d in the pill—this is the plac ebo eff ect.
To mak e sure tha t an y eff ects on mo od are due to the dr ug and not due to e xpecta tions , the c ontrol group
receives a plac ebo (in this c ase a sug ar pill). N ow ev eryone g ets a pill , and onc e again neither the rese archer
nor the e xperimental p articip ants kno w who g ot the dr ug and who g ot the sug ar pill . An y diff erenc es in mo od
between the e xperimental and c ontrol groups c an no w be attribute d to the dr ug itself ra ther than to
experimenter bias or p articip ant e xpecta tions ( Figure 2.16 ).

Independent and Dependent V ariables
In a rese arch e xperiment , we strive to s tudy whether chang es in one thing c ause chang es in another . To
achiev e this , we mus t pay attention to tw o imp ortant v aria bles , or things tha t can b e chang ed, in an y2.3 • Anal yzing Findings 53
experimental s tudy: the indep endent v aria ble and the dep endent v aria ble. An indep endent v ariable is
manipula ted or c ontrolle d by the e xperimenter . In a w ell-designe d experimental s tudy , the indep endent
varia ble is the only imp ortant diff erenc e between the e xperimental and c ontrol groups . In our e xample o f ho w
technolog y use in the clas sroom a ffects le arning , the indep endent v aria ble is the typ e of learning b y
particip ants in the s tudy ( Figure 2.17 ). A dep endent v ariable is wha t the rese archer me asures to see ho w
much eff ect the indep endent v aria ble had . In our e xample , the dep endent v aria ble is the le arning e xhibite d by
our p articip ants .

We expect tha t the dep endent v aria ble will chang e as a function o f the indep endent v aria ble. In other w ords ,
the dep endent v aria bledep ends on the indep endent v aria ble. A g ood way to think a bout the rela tionship
between the indep endent and dep endent v aria bles is with this ques tion: Wha t eff ect do es the indep endent
varia ble ha ve on the dep endent v aria ble? R eturning to our e xample , wha t is the eff ect o f being ta ught a les son
through a c omputer program v ersus through an in-p erson ins tructor?
Selecting and Assigning Experimental P articipants
Now tha t our s tudy is designe d, we nee d to obtain a sample o f individuals to include in our e xperiment . Our
study in volves human p articip ants so w e nee d to determine who to include .Particip ants are the subjects o f
psychologic al rese arch , and as the name implies , individuals who are in volved in ps ychologic al rese arch
activ ely p articip ate in the pro cess. Often , psychologic al rese arch projects rely on c olleg e students to ser ve as
particip ants . In fact , the v ast majority o f rese arch in ps ycholog y subfields has his toric ally in volved students as
rese arch p articip ants (Se ars, 1986; Arnet t, 2008). B ut are c olleg e students tr uly representa tive of the g eneral
popula tion? C olleg e students tend to b e young er, more e duc ated, more lib eral , and les s div erse than the
general p opula tion . Although using s tudents as tes t subjects is an ac cepte d practic e, relying on such a limite d
pool of rese arch p articip ants c an b e problema tic b ecause it is difficult to g eneraliz e findings to the larg er
popula tion .
Our h ypothetic al experiment in volves high scho ol students , and w e mus t firs t genera te a sample o f students .
Samples are use d because p opula tions are usually to o larg e to re asona bly in volve ev ery memb er in our
particular e xperiment ( Figure 2.18 ). If p ossible , we should use a random sample (there are other typ es o f54 2 • P sychological R esear ch

samples , but f or the purp oses o f this chapter , we will f ocus on random samples). A random sample is a subset
of a larg er p opula tion in which ev ery memb er o f the p opula tion has an e qual chanc e of being selecte d.
Random samples are pref erre d because if the sample is larg e enough w e can b e re asona bly sure tha t the
particip ating individuals are representa tive of the larg er p opula tion . This me ans tha t the p ercenta ges o f
characteris tics in the sample —se x, ethnicity , socioeconomic lev el, and an y other characteris tics tha t might
affect the results —are close to those p ercenta ges in the larg er p opula tion .
In our e xample , let’s sa y we decide our p opula tion o f interes t is alg ebra s tudents . But all alg ebra s tudents is a
very larg e popula tion , so w e nee d to b e more sp ecific; ins tead w e might sa y our p opula tion o f interes t is all
algebra s tudents in a p articular city . We should include s tudents from v arious inc ome brack ets, family
situa tions , rac es, ethnicities , religions , and g eographic are as o f town. With this more mana geable p opula tion ,
we can w ork with the lo cal scho ols in selecting a random sample o f around 200 alg ebra s tudents who w e want
to p articip ate in our e xperiment .
In summar y, because w e cannot tes t all o f the alg ebra s tudents in a city , we want to find a group o f about 200
that reflects the c omp osition o f tha t city . With a representa tive group , we can g eneraliz e our findings to the
larg er p opula tion without f ear o f our sample b eing biase d in some w ay.

Now tha t we ha ve a sample , the ne xt step o f the e xperimental pro cess is to split the p articip ants into
experimental and c ontrol groups through random as signment . Withrandom as signment , all p articip ants
have an e qual chanc e of being as signe d to either group . There is s tatistical so ftware tha t will randomly as sign
each o f the alg ebra s tudents in the sample to either the e xperimental or the c ontrol group .
Random as signment is critic al for sound experimental design . With sufficiently larg e samples , random
assignment mak es it unlik ely tha t there are s ystema tic diff erenc es b etween the groups . So, for ins tanc e, it
would b e very unlik ely tha t we would g et one group c omp osed entirely o f males , a giv en ethnic identity , or a
given religious ideolog y. This is imp ortant b ecause if the groups w ere s ystema tically diff erent b efore the
experiment b egan, we would not kno w the origin o f an y diff erenc es w e find b etween the groups: W ere the
differenc es pree xisting , or w ere the y caused by manipula tion o f the indep endent v aria ble? Random
assignment allo ws us to as sume tha t an y diff erenc es obser ved between e xperimental and c ontrol groups

Issues to Consider
While e xperiments allo w scientis ts to mak e cause-and-eff ect claims , the y are not without problems . True
2.3 • Anal yzing Findings 55
experiments re quire the e xperimenter to manipula te an indep endent v aria ble, and tha t can c omplic ate man y
ques tions tha t psychologis ts might w ant to addres s. For ins tanc e, ima gine tha t you w ant to kno w wha t eff ect
sex (the indep endent v aria ble) has on sp atial memor y (the dep endent v aria ble). A lthough y ou c an c ertainly
look for diff erenc es b etween males and f emales on a task tha t taps into sp atial memor y, you c annot directly
control a p erson ’s sex. We categoriz e this typ e of rese arch appro ach as quasi-e xperimental and rec ogniz e tha t
we cannot mak e cause-and-eff ect claims in these circums tanc es.
Exp erimenters are also limite d by ethic al constraints . For ins tanc e, you w ould not b e able to c onduct an
experiment designe d to determine if e xperiencing a buse as a child le ads to lo wer lev els o f self -esteem among
adults . To conduct such an e xperiment , you w ould nee d to randomly as sign some e xperimental p articip ants to
a group tha t rec eives a buse , and tha t experiment w ould b e unethic al.
Interpr eting Experimental Findings
Onc e da ta is c ollecte d from b oth the e xperimental and the c ontrol groups , astatistical analy sisis conducte d to
find out if there are me aningful diff erenc es b etween the tw o groups . A s tatistical analy sis determines ho w
likely an y diff erenc e found is due to chanc e (and thus not me aningful). F or e xample , if an e xperiment is done
on the eff ectiv enes s of a nutritional supplement , and those taking a plac ebo pill (and not the supplement) ha ve
the same result as those taking the supplement , then the e xperiment has sho wn tha t the nutritional
supplement is not eff ectiv e. Generally , psychologis ts consider diff erenc es to b e statistically signific ant if there
is les s than a fiv e percent chanc e of obser ving them if the groups did not actually diff er from one another .
Stated another w ay, psychologis ts w ant to limit the chanc es o f making “false p ositiv e” claims to fiv e percent or
less.
The gre atest strength o f experiments is the a bility to as sert tha t an y signific ant diff erenc es in the findings are
caused by the indep endent v aria ble. This o ccurs b ecause random selection , random as signment , and a design
that limits the eff ects o f both e xperimenter bias and p articip ant e xpectancy should cre ate groups tha t are
similar in c omp osition and tre atment . Theref ore, any diff erenc e between the groups is a ttributa ble to the
indep endent v aria ble, and no w w e can finally mak e a c ausal s tatement . If w e find tha t watching a violent
television program results in more violent b ehavior than w atching a non violent program , we can sa fely sa y
that watching violent television programs c auses an incre ase in the displa y of violent b ehavior .
Reporting R esear ch
When ps ychologis ts complete a rese arch project , the y generally w ant to share their findings with other
scientis ts. The Americ an P sychologic al As sociation (AP A) publishes a manual detailing ho w to write a p aper for

review also ensures tha t the rese arch is describ ed cle arly enough to allo w other scientis ts to replic ate it,
meaning the y can rep eat the e xperiment using diff erent samples to determine relia bility . Sometimes
replic ations in volve additional me asures tha t expand on the original finding . In an y case, each replic ation
serves to pro vide more evidenc e to supp ort the original rese arch findings . Suc cessful replic ations o f publishe d
rese arch mak e scientis ts more apt to adopt those findings , while rep eated failures tend to c ast doubt on the
legitimacy o f the original ar ticle and le ad scientis ts to lo ok elsewhere . For e xample , it w ould b e a major
advancement in the me dical field if a publishe d study indic ated tha t taking a new dr ug help ed individuals
achiev e a he alth y weight without changing their diet . But if other scientis ts could not replic ate the results , the
original s tudy ’s claims w ould b e ques tione d.
In rec ent y ears, there has b een incre asing c oncern a bout a “replic ation crisis” tha t has a ffecte d a numb er o f
scientific fields , including ps ycholog y. Some o f the mos t well-kno wn s tudies and scientis ts ha ve pro duced

famous N obel Prize-winning scientis t has rec ently retracte d a publishe d paper b ecause she had difficulty
replic ating her results (N obel Prize-winning scientis t Franc es Arnold retracts p aper, 2020 J anuar y 3). These

The V accine-A utism Myth and R etraction of Published Studies
Some scientis ts ha ve claimed that r outine childhood v accines cause some childr en to de velop autism, and, in
fact, se veral peer -reviewed publications published r esear ch making these claims . Sinc e the initial r epor ts, large-
scale epidemiological r esear ch has indicat ed that v accinations ar e not r esponsible f or causing autism and that it
is much saf er to ha ve your child v accinat ed than not. F urthermor e, several of the original s tudies making this
claim ha ve sinc e been r etracted.
A published piec e of work can be r escinded when data is cal led int o ques tion because o f falsification, fabrication,
or serious r esear ch design pr oblems . Onc e rescinded, the scientific c ommunity is inf ormed that ther e are serious
problems with the original publication. R etractions can be initiat ed b y the r esear cher who led the s tudy , by
resear ch c ollabor ators, by the ins titution that emplo yed the r esear cher , or b y the edit orial boar d of the journal in
which the ar ticle w as original ly published. In the v accine -autism case , the r etraction w as made because o f a
significant c onflict o f interest in which the leading r esear cher had a financial int erest in es tablishing a link
betw een childhood v accines and autism (Offit, 2008). Unf ortunat ely, the initial s tudies r eceived so much media
attention that man y par ents ar ound the w orld became hesitant t o ha ve their childr en v accinat ed (Figure 2.19 ).
Continued r elianc e on such debunk ed s tudies has significant c onsequenc es. For ins tanc e, betw een Januar y and
October o f 2019, ther e were 22 measles outbr eaks acr oss the Unit ed Stat es and mor e than a thousand cases o f

There are a numb er o f diff erent typ es o f relia bility . Some o f these include inter -rater relia bility (the degree to

How V alid Ar e the SA T and A CT?
Standar dized tests lik e the SA T and A CT ar e supposed t o measur e an individual ’s ap titude f or a c ollege

scores on the SA T ha ve high pr edictiv e validity f or firs t-year c ollege students’ GP A (K obrin, P atterson, Sha w,
Mattern, & Barbuti, 2008). In this c ontext, pr edictiv e validity r efers t o the t est’s ability t o eff ectiv ely predict the
GPA of college freshmen. Giv en that man y ins titutions o f higher education r equir e the SA T or A CT for admis sion,
this high degr ee o f predictiv e validity might be c omforting.
However, the emphasis plac ed on SA T or A CT sc ores in c ollege admis sions is changing based on a number o f
factors. For one , some r esear chers as sert that these t ests ar e biased, and s tudents fr om his torical ly mar ginaliz ed
populations ar e at a disadv antag e that unfairl y reduc es the lik elihood o f being admit ted int o a c ollege (Sant elices
& Wilson, 2010). Additional ly, some r esear ch has sug gested that the pr edictiv e validity o f these t ests is gr ossly
exaggerated in ho w well the y are able t o predict the GP A of firs t-year c ollege students . In fact, it has been
suggested that the SA T’s predictiv e validity ma y be o verestimat ed b y as much as 150% (R oths tein, 2004). Man y
institutions o f higher education ar e beginning t o consider de -emphasizing the significanc e of SAT sc ores in
making admis sion decisions (Rimer , 2008).
Recent e xamples o f high pr ofile cheating scandals both domes tical ly and abr oad ha ve onl y incr eased the scrutin y
being plac ed on these types o f tests, and as o f Mar ch 2019, mor e than 1000 ins titutions o f higher education ha ve

Summary
2.1 Why Is R esear ch Important?
Scientis ts are eng aged in e xplaining and unders tanding ho w the w orld around them w orks , and the y are a ble
to do so b y coming up with theories tha t genera te hypotheses tha t are tes table and falsifia ble. Theories tha t
stand up to their tes ts are retaine d and refine d, while those tha t do not are disc arde d or mo difie d. In this w ay,
rese arch ena bles scientis ts to sep arate fact from simple opinion . Ha ving g ood inf orma tion g enera ted from
rese arch aids in making wise decisions b oth in public p olicy and in our p ersonal liv es.
2.2 Appr oaches to R esear ch
The clinic al or c ase s tudy in volves studying jus t a few individuals f or an e xtende d perio d of time . While this
appro ach pro vides an incre dible depth o f inf orma tion , the a bility to g eneraliz e these obser vations to the larg er
popula tion is problema tic. Naturalis tic obser vation in volves obser ving b ehavior in a na tural set ting and allo ws64 2 • Summar y

for the c ollection o f valid , true-to-life inf orma tion from re alistic situa tions . Ho wever, naturalis tic obser vation
does not allo w for much c ontrol and o ften re quires quite a bit o f time and mone y to p erform . Researchers
strive to ensure tha t their to ols f or c ollecting da ta are b oth relia ble (c onsis tent and replic able) and v alid
(accura te).
Surveys can b e adminis tere d in a numb er o f ways and mak e it p ossible to c ollect larg e amounts o f data quickly .
However, the depth o f inf orma tion tha t can b e collecte d through sur veys is somewha t limite d comp ared to a
clinic al or c ase s tudy .
Archiv al rese arch in volves studying e xisting da ta sets to ans wer rese arch ques tions .
Longitudinal rese arch has b een incre dibly helpful to rese archers who nee d to c ollect da ta on ho w people
chang e over time . Cross-sectional rese arch c omp ares multiple segments o f a p opula tion a t a single time .
2.3 Analyzing Findings
A correla tion is describ ed with a c orrela tion c oefficient ,r, which rang es from -1 to 1. The c orrela tion
coefficient tells us a bout the na ture (p ositiv e or neg ative) and the s trength o f the rela tionship b etween tw o or
more v aria bles . Correla tions do not tell us an ything a bout c ausation—reg ardles s of ho w strong the rela tionship
is between v aria bles . In fact , the only w ay to demons trate causation is b y conducting an e xperiment . People
often mak e the mis take of claiming tha t correla tions e xist when the y re ally do not .
Researchers c an tes t cause-and-eff ect h ypotheses b y conducting e xperiments . Ide ally, experimental
particip ants are randomly selecte d from the p opula tion o f interes t. Then , the p articip ants are randomly
assigne d to their resp ectiv e groups . Sometimes , the rese archer and the p articip ants are blind to group
memb ership to prev ent their e xpecta tions from influencing the results .
In ide al experimental design , the only diff erenc e between the e xperimental and c ontrol groups is whether
particip ants are e xposed to the e xperimental manipula tion . Each group g oes through all phases o f the
experiment , but e ach group will e xperienc e a diff erent lev el of the indep endent v aria ble: the e xperimental
group is e xposed to the e xperimental manipula tion , and the c ontrol group is not e xposed to the e xperimental
manipula tion . The rese archer then me asures the chang es tha t are pro duced in the dep endent v aria ble in e ach
group . Onc e da ta is c ollecte d from b oth groups , it is analyz ed statistically to determine if there are me aningful
differenc es b etween the groups .
Psychologis ts rep ort their rese arch findings in p eer-review ed journal ar ticles . Research publishe d in this
forma t is check ed by sev eral other ps ychologis ts who ser ve as a filter sep arating ide as tha t are supp orted by
evidenc e from ide as tha t are not . Replic ation has an imp ortant role in ensuring the legitimacy o f publishe d
rese arch . In the long r un, only those findings tha t are c apable o f being replic ated consis tently will achiev e
consensus in the scientific c ommunity .
2.4 Ethics
Ethics in rese arch is an ev olving field , and some practic es tha t were ac cepte d or tolera ted in the p ast would b e
considere d unethic al to day. Researchers are e xpecte d to adhere to b asic ethic al guidelines when c onducting
experiments tha t involve human p articip ants . An y experiment in volving human p articip ants mus t be
appro ved by an IRB . Particip ation in e xperiments is v oluntar y and re quires inf orme d consent o f the
particip ants . If an y dec eption is in volved in the e xperiment , each p articip ant mus t be fully debrief ed up on the
conclusion o f the s tudy .
Animal rese arch is also held to a high ethic al standard . Researchers who use animals as e xperimental subjects
mus t design their projects so tha t pain and dis tres s are minimiz ed. Animal rese arch re quires the appro val of
an IA CUC , and all animal facilities are subject to regular insp ections to ensure tha t animals are b eing tre ated
humanely .2 • Summar y65

LEARNING OBJEC TIVES
By the end o f this section, y ou wil l be able t o:
•Explain the basic principles o f the theor y of evolution b y natur al selection
•Describe the diff erences betw een g enotype and phenotype
•Discus s ho w gene-environment int eractions ar e critical f or expression o f physical and ps ychological
char acteristics
Psychologic al rese archers s tudy g enetics in order to b etter unders tand the biologic al factors tha t contribute to
certain b ehaviors . While all humans share c ertain biologic al mechanisms , we are e ach unique . And while our
bodies ha ve man y of the same p arts—brains and hormones and c ells with g enetic c odes—these are e xpres sed
in a wide v ariety o f behaviors , thoughts , and re actions .
Why do tw o people inf ecte d by the same dise ase ha ve diff erent outc omes: one sur viving and one suc cumbing
to the ailment? Ho w are g enetic dise ases p assed through family lines? Are there g enetic c omp onents to
psychologic al disorders , such as depres sion or schiz ophrenia? T o wha t extent might there b e a ps ychologic al
basis to he alth c onditions such as childho od ob esity?
To explore these ques tions , let’s start by focusing on a sp ecific g enetic disorder , sickle c ell anemia, and ho w it
might manif est in tw o affecte d sis ters . Sickle -cell anemia is a g enetic c ondition in which re d blo od cells, which
are normally round , tak e on a cresc ent-like shap e (Figure 3.2 ). The chang ed shap e of these c ells a ffects ho w
they function: sickle -shap ed cells c an clog blo od vessels and blo ck blo od flo w, leading to high f ever, sev ere
pain, swelling , and tis sue dama ge.
FIGURE 3.2 Normal blood c ells travel freely thr ough the blood v essels , while sickle -shaped c ells form block ages
preventing blood flo w.
Man y people with sickle -cell anemia—and the p articular g enetic muta tion tha t causes it —die a t an e arly a ge.
While the notion o f “survival of the fit test” ma y sugg est tha t people with this disorder ha ve a lo w sur vival ra te
and theref ore the disorder will b ecome les s common , this is not the c ase. Despite the neg ative ev olutionar y
effects as sociated with this g enetic muta tion , the sickle -cell g ene remains rela tively c ommon among p eople o f
Afric an desc ent. Wh y is this? The e xplana tion is illus trated with the f ollowing sc enario .
Ima gine tw o young w omen—L uwi and Sena—sis ters in r ural Zambia, Afric a. Luwi c arries the g ene f or sickle -
cell anemia; Sena do es not c arry the g ene. Sickle -cell c arriers ha ve one c opy of the sickle -cell g ene but do not
have full-blo wn sickle -cell anemia. The y experienc e symptoms only if the y are sev erely deh ydrated or are

In both fields , it is unders tood that g enes not onl y code f or par ticular tr aits, but also c ontribut e to certain

Genetic V ariation
Genetic v aria tion , the g enetic diff erenc e between individuals , is wha t contributes to a sp ecies’ adapta tion to its
environment . In humans , genetic v aria tion b egins with an egg , about 100 million sp erm , and f ertiliza tion .
Roughly onc e per month , activ e ovaries rele ase an egg from f ollicles . During the egg 's journe y from the o vary
through the fallopian tub es, to the uter us, a sp erm ma y fertiliz e the egg .
The egg and the sp erm e ach c ontain 23 chromosomes .Chromosomes are long s trings o f genetic ma terial
kno wn as deo xyrib onucleic acid (DN A). DN A is a helix -shap ed molecule made up o f nucleotide b ase p airs . In
each chromosome , sequenc es o f DN A mak e up genes that control or p artially c ontrol a numb er o f visible
characteris tics, kno wn as traits , such as e ye color , hair c olor , and so on . A single g ene ma y ha ve multiple
possible v aria tions , or alleles . An allele is a sp ecific v ersion o f a g ene. So, a giv en g ene ma y code for the trait o f
hair c olor , and the diff erent alleles o f tha t gene a ffect which hair c olor an individual has .
When a sp erm and egg fuse , their 23 chromosomes c ombine to cre ate a zy gote with 46 chromosomes (23
pairs). Theref ore, each p arent c ontributes half the g enetic inf orma tion c arrie d by the o ffspring; the resulting
physical characteris tics o f the o ffspring (c alled the phenotyp e) are determine d by the interaction o f genetic
material supplie d by the sp erm and egg (c alled the g enotyp e). A p erson ’sgenot ypeis the g enetic mak eup o f
that individual .Phenot ype, on the other hand , ref ers to the individual ’s inherite d ph ysical characteris tics,
which are a c ombina tion o f genetic and en vironmental influenc es (Figure 3.4 ).

contribute g enetic ma terial to o ffspring , usually in the f orm o f gamete c ells (sp erm and egg ). The c oncept o f a
genetic p arent is dis tinct from so cial and leg al concepts o f parentho od, and ma y diff er from those whom
people c onsider their p arents .
Mos t traits are c ontrolle d by multiple g enes , but some traits are c ontrolle d by one g ene. A characteris tic lik e
cleft chin , for e xample , is influenc ed by a single g ene from e ach p arent . In this e xample , we will c all the g ene
for cleft chin “B ,” and the g ene f or smo oth chin “b .” Cleft chin is a dominant trait , which me ans tha t ha ving the
dominant allele either from one p arent (Bb) or b oth p arents (BB) will alw ays result in the phenotyp e
associated with the dominant allele . When someone has tw o copies o f the same allele , the y are said to b e
homo zygous for tha t allele . When someone has a c ombina tion o f alleles f or a giv en g ene, the y are said to b e
hetero zygous. For e xample , smo oth chin is a rec essive trait , which me ans tha t an individual will only displa y
the smo oth chin phenotyp e if the y are homo zygous f or tha trecessive allele (bb).
Ima gine tha t a p erson with a cleft chin ma tes with a p erson with a smo oth chin . Wha t typ e of chin will their
offspring ha ve? The ans wer to tha t dep ends on which alleles e ach p arent c arries . If the p erson with a cleft is
homo zygous f or cleft chin (BB), their o ffspring will alw ays ha ve cleft chin . It g ets a lit tle more c omplic ated,
however, if the p erson is hetero zygous f or this g ene (Bb). Sinc e the other p erson has a smo oth chin—theref ore
homo zygous f or the rec essive allele ( bb)—w e can e xpect the o ffspring to ha ve a 50% chanc e of having a cleft
chin and a 50% chanc e of having a smo oth chin ( Figure 3.5 ).

cleft chin phenotype . You can e xpect a smooth chin phenotype onl y when ther e are tw o copies o f the r ecessive
allele, bb. (b) A cleft chin, sho wn her e, is an inherit ed tr ait.
In sickle c ell anemia, hetero zygous c arriers ( like Luwi from the e xample) c an dev elop blo od resis tanc e to
malaria inf ection while those who are homo zygous ( like Sena) ha ve a p otentially lethal blo od disorder . Sickle -
cell anemia is jus t one o f man y genetic disorders c aused by the p airing o f two rec essive genes . For e xample ,
phen ylketonuria (PKU) is a c ondition in which individuals lack an enzyme tha t normally c onverts harmful
amino acids into harmles s bypro ducts . If someone with this c ondition g oes untre ated, the y will e xperienc e
signific ant deficits in c ognitiv e function , seizures , and an incre ased risk o f various ps ychia tric disorders .
Because PKU is a rec essive trait , each p arent mus t ha ve at least one c opy of the rec essive allele in order to
produce a child with the c ondition ( Figure 3.6 ).
So far , we ha ve discus sed traits tha t involve jus t one g ene, but f ew human characteris tics are c ontrolle d by a
single g ene. Mos t traits are polygenic : controlle d by more than one g ene. Height is one e xample o f a p olygenic
trait , as are skin c olor and w eight .3.1 • Human Genetics 75
FIGURE 3.6 In this Punnet t squar e, N r epresents the normal al lele, and p r epresents the r ecessive allele that is
associat ed with PKU . If tw o individuals mat e who ar e both het erozygous f or the al lele as sociat ed with PKU , their
offspring ha ve a 25% chanc e of expressing the PKU phenotype .
Where do harmful g enes tha t contribute to dise ases lik e PKU c ome from? Gene muta tions pro vide one sourc e
of harmful g enes . Amutat ion is a sudden , permanent chang e in a g ene. While man y muta tions c an b e harmful
or lethal , onc e in a while , a muta tion b enefits an individual b y giving tha t person an adv anta ge over those who
do not ha ve the muta tion . Recall tha t the theor y of evolution as serts tha t individuals b est adapte d to their
particular en vironments are more lik ely to repro duce and p ass on their g enes to future g enera tions . In order
for this pro cess to o ccur, there mus t be comp etition—more technic ally, there mus t be varia bility in g enes (and
resultant traits) tha t allo w for v aria tion in adapta bility to the en vironment . If a p opula tion c onsis ted of
identic al individuals , then an y drama tic chang es in the en vironment w ould a ffect ev eryone in the same w ay,
and there w ould b e no v aria tion in selection . In c ontras t, div ersity in g enes and as sociated traits allo ws some
individuals to p erform slightly b etter than others when fac ed with en vironmental chang e. This cre ates a
distinct adv anta ge for individuals b est suite d for their en vironments in terms o f suc cessful repro duction and
genetic transmis sion .
Human Div ersity

Gene-Envir onment Inter actions
Genes do not e xist in a v acuum . Although w e are all biologic al org anisms , we also e xist in an en vironment tha t
is incre dibly imp ortant in determining not only when and ho w our g enes e xpres s themselv es, but also in wha t
combina tion . Each o f us represents a unique interaction b etween our g enetic mak eup and our en vironment;
rang e of reaction is one w ay to describ e this interaction .Rang e of re action asserts tha t our g enes set the
boundaries within which w e can op erate, and our en vironment interacts with the g enes to determine where in
that rang e we will fall . For e xample , if an individual ’s genetic mak eup pre disp oses them to high lev els o f
intellectual p otential and the y are re ared in a rich , stimula ting en vironment , then the y will b e more lik ely to
achiev e full p otential than if the y were raise d under c onditions o f signific ant depriv ation . According to the
concept o f rang e of reaction , genes set definite limits on p otential , and en vironment determines ho w much o f
that potential is achiev ed. Some disa gree with this theor y and argue tha t genes do not set a limit on a p erson ’s
potential with re action norms b eing determine d by the en vironment . For e xample , when individuals
experienc e neglect or a buse e arly in lif e, the y are more lik ely to e xhibit adv erse ps ychologic al and/or ph ysical
conditions tha t can las t throughout their liv es. These c onditions ma y dev elop as a function o f the neg ative
environmental e xperienc es in individuals from dis similar g enetic b ackgrounds (Miguel , Pereira, Silv eira, &
Meaney, 2019; Shor t & Baram , 2019).
Another p ersp ectiv e on the interaction b etween g enes and the en vironment is the c oncept o fgenet ic
environmental c orrelat ion. Sta ted simply , our g enes influenc e our en vironment , and our en vironment
influenc es the e xpres sion o f our g enes ( Figure 3.7 ). Not only do our g enes and en vironment interact , as in
rang e of reaction , but the y also influenc e one another bidirectionally . For e xample , the child o f an NB A pla yer
would prob ably b e exposed to b asketball from an e arly a ge. Such e xposure might allo w the child to re alize
their full g enetic , athletic p otential . Thus , the p arents’ g enes , which the child shares , influenc e the child ’s
environment , and tha t en vironment , in turn , is w ell suite d to supp ort the child ’s genetic p otential .

In another appro ach to g ene-environment interactions , the field o fepig enet icslooks b eyond the g enotyp e
itself and s tudies ho w the same g enotyp e can b e expres sed in diff erent w ays. In other w ords , rese archers s tudy
how the same g enotyp e can le ad to v ery diff erent phenotyp es. As mentione d earlier , gene e xpres sion is o ften
influenc ed by en vironmental c onte xt in w ays tha t are not entirely ob vious . For ins tanc e, identic al twins share
the same g enetic inf orma tion ( ident ical twins develop from a single f ertiliz ed egg tha t split , so the g enetic
material is e xactly the same in e ach; in c ontras t,fraternal t wins usually result from tw o diff erent eggs
fertiliz ed by diff erent sp erm , so the g enetic ma terial v aries as with non-twin siblings). B ut ev en with identic al
genes , there remains an incre dible amount o f varia bility in ho w gene e xpres sion c an unf old o ver the c ourse o f
each twin ’s life. Sometimes , one twin will dev elop a dise ase and the other will not . In one e xample , Aliya, an

individuals share an identic al genotyp e, their phenotyp es diff er as a result o f ho w tha t genetic inf orma tion is3.1 • Human Genetics 77

Genes affect more than our ph ysical characteris tics. Indee d, scientis ts ha ve found g enetic linka ges to a
numb er o f behavioral characteris tics, ranging from b asic p ersonality traits to se xual orienta tion to spirituality
(for e xamples , see Mus tanski et al ., 2005; C omings , Gonzales , Saucier , Johnson , & MacMurra y, 2000). Genes are
also as sociated with temp erament and a numb er o f psychologic al disorders , such as depres sion and
schiz ophrenia. So while it is tr ue tha t genes pro vide the biologic al blueprints f or our c ells, tissues , org ans, and
body, the y also ha ve a signific ant imp act on our e xperienc es and our b ehaviors .
Let’s look a t the f ollowing findings reg arding schiz ophrenia in light o f our three view s of gene-environment
interactions . Which view do y ou think b est explains this evidenc e?
In a 2004 s tudy b y Tienari and c olleagues , adoptees whose biologic al mothers had schiz ophrenia and who had
been raise d in a dis turb ed family en vironment w ere much more lik ely to dev elop schiz ophrenia or another
psychotic disorder than w ere an y of the other groups in the s tudy:
•Of adoptees whose biologic al mothers had schiz ophrenia ( high g enetic risk) and who w ere raise d in
disturb ed family en vironments , 36.8% w ere lik ely to dev elop schiz ophrenia.
•Of adoptees whose biologic al mothers had schiz ophrenia ( high g enetic risk) and who w ere raise d in
health y family en vironments , 5.8% w ere lik ely to dev elop schiz ophrenia.
•Of adoptees with a lo w genetic risk ( whose mothers did not ha ve schiz ophrenia) and who w ere raise d in
disturb ed family en vironments , 5.3% w ere lik ely to dev elop schiz ophrenia.
•Of adoptees with a lo w genetic risk ( whose mothers did not ha ve schiz ophrenia) and who w ere raise d in
health y family en vironments , 4.8% w ere lik ely to dev elop schiz ophrenia.
The s tudy sho ws tha t adoptees with high g enetic risk w ere mos t lik ely to dev elop schiz ophrenia if the y were
raise d in dis turb ed home en vironments . This rese arch lends cre dibility to the notion tha t both g enetic
vulnera bility and en vironmental s tres s are nec essary for schiz ophrenia to dev elop , and tha t genes alone do not
tell the full tale .

By the end o f this section, y ou wil l be able t o:
•Identif y the basic par ts of a neur on
•Describe ho w neur ons c ommunicat e with each other
•Explain ho w drugs act as ag onis ts or antag onis ts for a giv en neur otransmit ter system
Psychologis ts striving to unders tand the human mind ma y study the ner vous s ystem . Learning ho w the b ody's
cells and org ans function c an help us unders tand the biologic al basis o f human ps ycholog y. The ner vous
system is comp osed of two basic c ell typ es: glial c ells (also kno wn as glia) and neurons . Glial c ells are
traditionally thought to pla y a supp ortive role to neurons , both ph ysically and meta bolically.Glial c ells provide
scaffolding on which the ner vous s ystem is built , help neurons line up closely with e ach other to allo w
neuronal c ommunic ation , pro vide insula tion to neurons , transp ort nutrients and w aste pro ducts , and me diate
immune resp onses . For y ears, rese archers b eliev ed tha t there w ere man y more glial c ells than neurons;

assumption into ques tion and has pro vide d imp ortant evidenc e tha t there ma y be a ne arly 1:1 ra tio o f glia c ells

than previously thought (A zevedo et al , 2009; Herculano -Houz el, 2012; Herculano -Houz el, 2009). Neurons , on

nervous s ystem . This section briefly describ es the s tructure and function o f neurons .
Neur on Structur e
Neurons are the c entral building blo cks o f the ner vous s ystem , 100 billion s trong a t bir th. Lik e all c ells,
neurons c onsis t of sev eral diff erent p arts, each ser ving a sp ecializ ed function ( Figure 3.8 ). A neuron ’s outer
surface is made up o f asemip erme able membrane . This membrane allo ws smaller molecules and molecules
without an electric al charg e to p ass through it , while s topping larg er or highly charg ed molecules .
FIGURE 3.8 This il lustration sho ws a pr ototypical neur on, which is being m yelinat ed b y a glial c ell.
The nucleus o f the neuron is lo cated in the soma , or c ell b ody. The soma has branching e xtensions kno wn as
dendrites . The neuron is a small inf orma tion pro cessor, and dendrites ser ve as input sites where signals are
received from other neurons . These signals are transmit ted electric ally acros s the soma and do wn a major
extension from the soma kno wn as the axon, which ends a t multiple terminal buttons . The terminal but tons
contain synapt ic vesicles that house neurotransmitters , the chemic al mes seng ers o f the ner vous s ystem .
Axons rang e in length from a fraction o f an inch to sev eral f eet. In some ax ons, glial c ells f orm a fa tty subs tanc e
kno wn as the myelin she ath, which c oats the ax on and acts as an insula tor, incre asing the sp eed at which the
signal tra vels. The m yelin she ath is not c ontinuous and there are small g aps tha t occur do wn the length o f the
axon. These g aps in the m yelin she ath are kno wn as the Nodes of Ran vier . The m yelin she ath is cr ucial f or the
normal op eration o f the neurons within the ner vous s ystem: the los s of the insula tion it pro vides c an b e
detrimental to normal function . To unders tand ho w this w orks , let’s consider an e xample . PKU , a g enetic
disorder discus sed earlier , causes a re duction in m yelin and a bnormalities in white ma tter c ortical and
subcortical structures . The disorder is as sociated with a v ariety o f issues including sev ere c ognitiv e deficits ,
exaggerated refle xes, and seizures (Anderson & Leuzzi , 2010; Hut tenlo cher , 2000). Another disorder , multiple
sclerosis (MS ), an a utoimmune disorder , involves a larg e-scale los s of the m yelin she ath on ax ons throughout
the ner vous s ystem . The resulting inter ferenc e in the electric al signal prev ents the quick transmit tal o f
informa tion b y neurons and c an le ad to a numb er o f symptoms , such as dizzines s, fatigue , los s of motor
control , and se xual dy sfunction . While some tre atments ma y help to mo dify the c ourse o f the dise ase and
mana ge certain s ymptoms , there is currently no kno wn cure f or multiple sclerosis .
In he alth y individuals , the neuronal signal mo ves rapidly do wn the ax on to the terminal but tons , where
synaptic v esicles rele ase neurotransmit ters into the s ynaptic cleft ( Figure 3.9 ). The synapt ic cleft is a v ery
small sp ace between tw o neurons and is an imp ortant site where c ommunic ation b etween neurons o ccurs .
Onc e neurotransmit ters are rele ased into the s ynaptic cleft , the y tra vel acros s it and bind with c orresp onding
receptors on the dendrite o f an adjac ent neuron .Receptors , proteins on the c ell sur face where
neurotransmit ters a ttach , vary in shap e, with diff erent shap es “ma tching ” diff erent neurotransmit ters .
How do es a neurotransmit ter “kno w” which rec eptor to bind to? The neurotransmit ter and the rec eptor ha ve3.2 • Cel ls of the Ner vous Sy stem 79

Neur onal Communication
Now tha t we ha ve learne d about the b asic s tructures o f the neuron and the role tha t these s tructures pla y in
neuronal c ommunic ation , let’s tak e a closer lo ok a t the signal itself —ho w it mo ves through the neuron and then
jumps to the ne xt neuron , where the pro cess is rep eated.
We begin a t the neuronal membrane . The neuron exists in a fluid en vironment —it is surrounde d by
extrac ellular fluid and c ontains intrac ellular fluid (i .e., cytoplasm). The neuronal membrane k eeps these tw o
fluids sep arate—a critic al role b ecause the electric al signal tha t passes through the neuron dep ends on the
intra- and e xtrac ellular fluids b eing electric ally diff erent . This diff erenc e in charg e acros s the membrane ,
called the membrane p otent ial, pro vides energ y for the signal .
The electric al charg e of the fluids is c aused by charg ed molecules (ions) dis solv ed in the fluid . The
semip erme able na ture o f the neuronal membrane somewha t res tricts the mo vement o f these charg ed
molecules , and , as a result , some o f the charg ed particles tend to b ecome more c oncentra ted either inside or
outside the c ell.
Betw een signals , the neuron membrane ’s potential is held in a s tate of readines s, called the resting p otent ial.
Like a r ubb er b and s tretche d out and w aiting to spring into action , ions line up on either side o f the c ell
membrane , ready to r ush acros s the membrane when the neuron g oes activ e and the membrane op ens its
gates. Ions in high-c oncentra tion are as are re ady to mo ve to lo w-concentra tion are as, and p ositiv e ions are

In the res ting s tate, sodium (N a+) is a t higher c oncentra tions outside the c ell, so it will tend to mo ve into the

proteins (br own squar es), help c ontribut e to a positiv e net char ge in the e xtracellular fluid and a neg ative net char ge
in the intr acellular fluid.
From this res ting p otential s tate, the neuron rec eives a signal and its s tate chang es a bruptly ( Figure 3.11 ).
When a neuron rec eives signals a t the dendrites —due to neurotransmit ters from an adjac ent neuron binding
to its rec eptors —small p ores , or g ates, open on the neuronal membrane , allo wing N a+ions , prop elled by both
charg e and c oncentra tion diff erenc es, to mo ve into the c ell. With this influx o f positiv e ions , the internal
charg e of the c ell b ecomes more p ositiv e. If tha t charg e re aches a c ertain lev el, called the threshold of
excitat ion, the neuron b ecomes activ e and the action p otential b egins .
Man y additional p ores op en, causing a mas sive influx o f Na+ions and a hug e positiv e spik e in the membrane

open. As p ositiv ely charg ed potas sium ions le ave, the c ell quickly b egins rep olariza tion . At firs t, it
hyperpolariz es, becoming slightly more neg ative than the res ting p otential , and then it lev els o ff, returning to
the res ting p otential .
FIGURE 3.11 During the action pot ential , the electrical char ge acr oss the membr ane chang es dr amatical ly.
This p ositiv e spik e constitutes the action p otent ial: the electric al signal tha t typic ally mo ves from the c ell b ody
down the ax on to the ax on terminals . The electric al signal mo ves do wn the ax on with the impulses jumping in
a leapfrog fashion b etween the N odes o f Ran vier. The N odes o f Ran vier are na tural g aps in the m yelin she ath.
At each p oint , some o f the so dium ions tha t enter the c ell diffuse to the ne xt section o f the ax on, raising the
charg e past the threshold o f excitation and trigg ering a new influx o f sodium ions . The action p otential mo ves3.2 • Cel ls of the Ner vous Sy stem 81
all the w ay do wn the ax on in this fashion until re aching the terminal but tons .
The action p otential is an all-or -none phenomenon . In simple terms , this me ans tha t an inc oming signal from
another neuron is either sufficient or insufficient to re ach the threshold o f excitation . There is no in-b etween,
and there is no turning o ff an action p otential onc e it s tarts. Think o f it lik e sending an email or a te xt mes sage.
You c an think a bout sending it all y ou w ant, but the mes sage is not sent until y ou hit the send but ton.
Furthermore , onc e you send the mes sage, there is no s topping it .
Because it is all or none , the action p otential is recre ated, or prop agated, at its full s trength a t every point along
the ax on. Much lik e the lit fuse o f a firecrack er, it do es not fade a way as it tra vels do wn the ax on. It is this all-or -
none prop erty tha t explains the fact tha t your brain p erceives an injur y to a dis tant b ody p art lik e your to e as
equally p ainful as one to y our nose .
As note d earlier , when the action p otential arriv es a t the terminal but ton, the s ynaptic v esicles rele ase their
neurotransmit ters into the s ynaptic cleft . The neurotransmit ters tra vel acros s the s ynapse and bind to
receptors on the dendrites o f the adjac ent neuron , and the pro cess rep eats itself in the new neuron (as suming
the signal is sufficiently s trong to trigg er an action p otential). Onc e the signal is deliv ered, excess
neurotransmit ters in the s ynaptic cleft drift a way, are brok en do wn into inactiv e fra gments , or are re absorb ed
in a pro cess kno wn as reuptak e. Reuptak e involves the neurotransmit ter b eing pump ed back into the neuron
that rele ased it, in order to cle ar the s ynapse ( Figure 3.12 ). Cle aring the s ynapse ser ves b oth to pro vide a cle ar
“on” and “ off” state between signals and to regula te the pro duction o f neurotransmit ter (full s ynaptic v esicles
provide signals tha t no additional neurotransmit ters nee d to b e pro duced).
FIGURE 3.12 Reuptake involves mo ving a neur otransmit ter fr om the s ynapse back int o the ax on terminal fr om
which it w as released.
Neuronal c ommunic ation is o ften ref erre d to as an electro chemic al ev ent. The mo vement o f the action
potential do wn the length o f the ax on is an electric al ev ent, and mo vement o f the neurotransmit ter acros s the
synaptic sp ace represents the chemic al portion o f the pro cess. Ho wever, there are some sp ecializ ed
connections b etween neurons tha t are entirely electric al. In such c ases , the neurons are said to c ommunic ate
via an electric al synapse . In these c ases , two neurons ph ysically c onnect to one another via g ap junctions ,
which allo ws the current from one c ell to p ass into the ne xt. There are far f ewer electric al synapses in the
brain , but those tha t do e xist are much fas ter than the chemic al synapses tha t ha ve been describ ed above

•Differentiat e betw een the s ympathetic and par asympathetic divisions o f the aut onomic ner vous s ystem
The nervous s ystem can b e divide d into tw o major sub divisions: the central ner vous sy stem (CNS )and the
peripheral ner vous sy stem (PNS ), sho wn in Figure 3.13 . The CNS is c omprise d of the brain and spinal c ord;
the PNS c onnects the CNS to the res t of the b ody. In this section , we focus on the p eripheral ner vous s ystem;
later, we look a t the brain and spinal c ord.
FIGURE 3.13 The ner vous s ystem is divided int o tw o major par ts: (a) the Centr al Ner vous Sy stem and (b) the
Peripher al Ner vous Sy stem.
Peripher al Nervous System
The p eripheral ner vous s ystem is made up o f thick bundles o f axons, called ner ves, carrying mes sages b ack
and f orth b etween the CNS and the muscles , org ans, and senses in the p eripher y of the b ody (i .e., ev erything
outside the CNS ). The PNS has tw o major sub divisions: the soma tic ner vous s ystem and the a utonomic84 3 • Biops ycholog y

nervous s ystem .
The somat ic ner vous sy stem is as sociated with activities traditionally thought o f as c onscious or v oluntar y. It
is in volved in the rela y of sensor y and motor inf orma tion to and from the CNS; theref ore, it c onsis ts of motor
neurons and sensor y neurons . Motor neurons , carrying ins tructions from the CNS to the muscles , are eff erent
fibers (eff erent me ans “mo ving a way from ”). Sensor y neurons , carrying sensor y inf orma tion to the CNS, are
afferent fib ers (a fferent me ans “mo ving to ward”). A helpful w ay to rememb er this is tha tefferent = exit and
afferent = arrive. Each ner ve is b asic ally a bundle o f neurons f orming a tw o-way sup erhigh way, containing
thousands o f axons, both eff erent and a fferent .
The autonomic ner vous sy stem controls our internal org ans and glands and is g enerally c onsidere d to b e
outside the re alm o f voluntar y control . It c an b e fur ther sub divide d into the s ymp athetic and p aras ymp athetic
divisions ( Figure 3.14 ). The symp athet ic ner vous sy stem is in volved in prep aring the b ody for stres s-rela ted
activities; the parasymp athet ic ner vous sy stem is as sociated with returning the b ody to routine , day-to-day
operations . The tw o systems ha ve complementar y functions , operating in tandem to maintain the b ody’s
homeos tasis .Homeos tasis is a s tate of equilibrium , or b alanc e, in which biologic al conditions (such as b ody
temp erature) are maintaine d at optimal lev els.
FIGURE 3.14 The s ympathetic and par asympathetic divisions o f the aut onomic ner vous s ystem ha ve the opposit e

The brain is a remarka bly c omple x org an c omprise d of billions o f interc onnecte d neurons and glia. It is a
bila teral , or tw o-side d, structure tha t can b e sep arated into dis tinct lob es. Each lob e is as sociated with c ertain
types o f functions , but , ultima tely, all o f the are as o f the brain interact with one another to pro vide the
founda tion f or our thoughts and b ehaviors . In this section , we discus s the o verall org aniza tion o f the brain and
the functions as sociated with diff erent brain are as, beginning with wha t can b e seen as an e xtension o f the
brain , the spinal c ord.
The Spinal Cor d
It can b e said tha t the spinal c ord is wha t connects the brain to the outside w orld . Bec ause o f it, the brain c an
act. The spinal c ord is lik e a rela y station , but a v ery smar t one . It not only routes mes sages to and from the
brain , but it also has its o wn s ystem o f automa tic pro cesses, called refle xes.
The top o f the spinal c ord is a bundle o f ner ves tha t merg es with the brain s tem , where the b asic pro cesses o f
life are c ontrolle d, such as bre athing and dig estion . In the opp osite direction , the spinal c ord ends jus t below
the ribs —contrar y to wha t we might e xpect, it do es not e xtend all the w ay to the b ase o f the spine .
The spinal c ord is functionally org aniz ed in 30 segments , corresp onding with the v ertebrae . Each segment is
connecte d to a sp ecific p art of the b ody through the p eripheral ner vous s ystem . Nerves branch out from the
spine a t each v ertebra. Sensor y ner ves bring mes sages in; motor ner ves send mes sages out to the muscles and
organs. Mes sages tra vel to and from the brain through ev ery segment .
Some sensor y mes sages are imme diately acte d on b y the spinal c ord, without an y input from the brain .

Withdra wal from a hot object and the knee jerk are tw o examples . When a sensor y mes sage meets c ertain
parameters , the spinal c ord initia tes an a utoma tic refle x. The signal p asses from the sensor y ner ve to a simple
processing c enter , which initia tes a motor c ommand . Sec onds are sa ved, because mes sages don ’t ha ve to g o
the brain , be pro cessed, and g et sent b ack. In ma tters o f sur vival, the spinal refle xes allo w the b ody to re act
extraordinarily fas t.
The spinal c ord is protecte d by bony vertebrae and cushione d in c erebrospinal fluid , but injuries s till o ccur.
When the spinal c ord is dama ged in a p articular segment , all lo wer segments are cut o ff from the brain ,
causing p araly sis. Theref ore, the lo wer on the spine dama ge occurs , the f ewer functions an injure d individual

(Fernande z, 2008, Octob er 16).
One o f the factors tha t made this rec overy possible w asneuroplas ticity. Neuroplas ticity ref ers to ho w the

that has o ccurre d. Neuroplas ticity c an in volve cre ation o f new s ynapses , pruning o f synapses tha t are no
long er use d, chang es in glial c ells, and ev en the bir th o f new neurons . Bec ause o f neuroplas ticity , our brains

self-rec ognition ma y follow patterns tha t sugg est some degree o f hemispheric dominanc e (G azzanig a, 2005).
For e xample , the left hemisphere has b een sho wn to b e sup erior f or forming as sociations in memor y, selectiv e

behavior ra ther than a ttributing c ertain b ehaviors to one hemisphere v ersus the other (Banich & Heller , 1998).
The tw o hemispheres are c onnecte d by a thick b and o f neural fib ers kno wn as the corpus c allosum , consis ting

Normally , we are not a ware o f the diff erent roles tha t our tw o hemispheres pla y in da y-to-day functions , but
there are p eople who c ome to kno w the c apabilities and functions o f their tw o hemispheres quite w ell. In some

People who suff er dama ge to Bro ca’s are a ha ve gre at difficulty pro ducing langua ge of an y form ( Figure 3.18 ).

Probably the mos t famous c ase o f frontal lob e dama ge is tha t of a man b y the name o f Phine asGage. On
Septemb er 13, 1848, G age (age 25) w as w orking as a railro ad foreman in V ermont . He and his crew w ere using
an iron ro d to tamp e xplosiv es do wn into a blas ting hole to remo ve ro ck along the railw ay’s path.
Unfortuna tely, the iron ro d cre ated a sp ark and c aused the ro d to e xplo de out o f the blas ting hole , into G age’s
face, and through his sk ull ( Figure 3.19 ). Although lying in a p ool of his o wn blo od with brain ma tter emerging
from his he ad, Gage was c onscious and a ble to g et up , walk, and sp eak. But in the months f ollowing his
accident , people notic ed tha t his p ersonality had chang ed. Man y of his friends describ ed him as no long er
being himself. Bef ore the ac cident , it w as said tha t Gage was a w ell-mannere d, soft-spoken man , but he b egan
to b ehave in o dd and inappropria te w ays after the ac cident . Such chang es in p ersonality w ould b e consis tent
with los s of impulse c ontrol—a frontal lob e function .
Beyond the dama ge to the frontal lob e itself, subse quent in vestigations into the ro d's p ath also identifie d
prob able dama ge to p athways between the frontal lob e and other brain s tructures , including the limbic
system . With c onnections b etween the planning functions o f the frontal lob e and the emotional pro cesses o f
the limbic s ystem sev ered, Gage had difficulty c ontrolling his emotional impulses .
However, there is some evidenc e sugg esting tha t the drama tic chang es in G age’s personality w ere e xaggerated
and emb ellishe d. Gage's case o ccurre d in the mids t of a 19thcentur y deb ate over lo caliza tion—reg arding

Midbr ain and Hindbr ain Structur es
The midbrain is comprise d of structures lo cated deep within the brain , between the f orebrain and the
hindbrain . The reticular f ormat ion is centere d in the midbrain , but it actually e xtends up into the f orebrain
and do wn into the hindbrain . The reticular f orma tion is imp ortant in regula ting the sleep/w ake cy cle, arousal ,
aler tnes s, and motor activity .
The subs tant ia nigra (Latin f or “black subs tanc e”) and the ventral tegmental are a (VTA)are also lo cated in
the midbrain ( Figure 3.24 ). Both regions c ontain c ell b odies tha t pro duce the neurotransmit ter dop amine , and
both are critic al for mo vement . Deg enera tion o f the subs tantia nigra and V TA is in volved in P arkinson ’s
dise ase. In addition , these s tructures are in volved in mo od, rew ard, and addiction (Berridg e & R obinson , 1998;
Gardner , 2011; Georg e, Le Mo al, & K oob, 2012).
FIGURE 3.24 The subs tantia nigr a and v entr al tegmental ar ea (VTA) ar e locat ed in the midbr ain.
The hindbrain is lo cated at the b ack o f the he ad and lo oks lik e an e xtension o f the spinal c ord. It c ontains the
medulla, p ons, and c ereb ellum ( Figure 3.25 ). The medulla controls the a utoma tic pro cesses o f the a utonomic
nervous s ystem , such as bre athing , blo od pres sure , and he art rate. The w ord p ons literally me ans “bridg e,”
3.4 • The Br ain and Spinal Cor d 93
and as the name sugg ests, the pons serves to c onnect the hindbrain to the res t of the brain . It also is in volved
in regula ting brain activity during sleep . The me dulla, p ons, and v arious s tructures are kno wn as the

The cereb ellum (Latin f or “lit tle brain ”) rec eives mes sages from muscles , tendons , joints , and s tructures in
our e ar to c ontrol b alanc e, coordina tion , mo vement , and motor skills . The c ereb ellum is also thought to b e an

Brain Dead and on Lif e Support
What w ould y ou do if y our spouse or lo ved one w as declar ed br ain dead but their body w as being k ept aliv e by
medical equipment? Whose decision should it be t o remo ve a f eeding tube? Should medical car e costs be a
factor?
On F ebruar y 25, 1990, a Florida w oman named T erriSchia vowent int o car diac arr est, appar ently trig gered b y a
bulimic episode . She w as e ventual ly revived, but her br ain had been depriv ed o f oxygen for a long time . Brain
scans indicat ed that ther e was no activity in her c erebral cortex, and she suff ered fr om se vere and permanent
cerebral atr ophy. Basical ly, Schia vo was in a v egetativ e state. Medical pr ofessionals det ermined that she w ould
never ag ain be able t o mo ve, talk, or r espond in an y way. To remain aliv e, she r equir ed a f eeding tube , and ther e
was no chanc e that her situation w ould e ver impr ove.
On oc casion, Schia vo’s eyes w ould mo ve, and sometimes she w ould gr oan. Despit e the doct ors’ insis tence to the
contr ary, her par ents belie ved that these w ere signs that she w as tr ying t o communicat e with them.
After 12 y ears , Schia vo’s husband ar gued that his wif e would not ha ve wanted to be k ept aliv e with no f eelings ,
sensations , or br ain activity . Her par ents , however, were very much ag ains t remo ving her f eeding tube .
Eventual ly, the case made its w ay to the c ourts, both in the s tate of Florida and at the f eder al le vel. By 2005, the
courts found in fa vor of Schia vo’s husband, and the f eeding tube w as remo ved on Mar ch 18, 2005. Schia vo died
13 da ys lat er.
Why did Schia vo’s eyes sometimes mo ve, and wh y did she gr oan? Al though the par ts of her br ain that c ontr olWHA T DO Y OU THINK?94 3 • Biops ycholog y

and pons maintained her br eathing and caused in voluntar y mo vements o f her e yes and the oc casional gr oans .
Over the 15- year period that she w as on a f eeding tube , Schia vo’s medical c osts ma y ha ve topped $7 mil lion
(Arns t, 2003).
These ques tions w ere brought t o popular c onscienc e decades ag o in the case o f Terri Schia vo, and the y ha ve

Ther e was a bat tle betw een her famil y, who w anted her t o remain on lif e suppor t, and the hospital ’s policies
regarding persons declar ed br ain dead. In another c omplicat ed 2013–14 case in T exas, a pr egnant EMT

body or brain ( Figure 3.26 ). The x -rays pass through tis sues o f diff erent densities a t diff erent ra tes, allo wing a

•Identif y the major glands o f the endocrine s ystem

•Describe each hormone ’s role in r egulating bodil y functions
The endo crine sy stem consis ts of a series o f glands tha t pro duce chemic al subs tanc es kno wn as hormones
(Figure 3.30 ). Lik e neurotransmit ters , hormones are chemic al mes seng ers tha t mus t bind to a rec eptor in
order to send their signal . Ho wever, unlik e neurotransmit ters , which are rele ased in close pro ximity to c ells
with their rec eptors , hormones are secrete d into the blo odstream and tra vel throughout the b ody, affecting an y
cells tha t contain rec eptors f or them . Thus , where as neurotransmit ters’ eff ects are lo calized, the eff ects o f
hormones are widespre ad. Also, hormones are slo wer to tak e eff ect, and tend to b e long er las ting .3.5 • The Endocrine Sy stem 97
FIGURE 3.30 The major glands o f the endocrine s ystem ar e sho wn.
Hormones are in volved in regula ting all sor ts of bodily functions , and the y are ultima tely c ontrolle d through
interactions b etween the h ypothalamus (in the c entral ner vous s ystem) and the pituitar y gland (in the
endo crine s ystem). Imb alanc es in hormones are rela ted to a numb er o f disorders . This section e xplores some
of the major glands tha t mak e up the endo crine s ystem and the hormones secrete d by these glands ( Table 3.2 ).
Major Glands
The pituitar y gland desc ends from the h ypothalamus a t the b ase o f the brain , and acts in close as sociation
with it . The pituitar y is o ften ref erre d to as the “mas ter gland ” because its mes seng er hormones c ontrol all the
other glands in the endo crine s ystem , although it mos tly c arries out ins tructions from the h ypothalamus . In
addition to mes seng er hormones , the pituitar y also secretes gro wth hormone , endorphins f or p ain relief, and a
numb er o f key hormones tha t regula te fluid lev els in the b ody.
Located in the neck , the thyroid gland rele ases hormones tha t regula te gro wth , meta bolism , and app etite . In
hyperthyroidism , or Gra ve’s dise ase, the th yroid secretes to o much o f the hormone th yroxine , causing
agita tion , bulging e yes, and w eight los s. In h ypothyroidism , reduced hormone lev els c ause suff erers to
experienc e tire dnes s, and the y often c omplain o f feeling c old. Fortuna tely, thyroid disorders are o ften tre atable
with me dications tha t help rees tablish a b alanc e in the hormones secrete d by the th yroid .
The adrenal glands sit a top our kidne ys and secrete hormones in volved in the s tres s resp onse , such as
epinephrine (adrenaline) and norepinephrine (noradrenaline). The pancre asis an internal org an tha t secretes
hormones tha t regula te blo od sug ar lev els: insulin and gluc agon. These p ancre atic hormones are es sential f or
maintaining s table lev els o f blo od sug ar throughout the da y by lowering blo od gluc ose lev els (insulin) or
raising them ( gluc agon). P eople who suff er from diab etes do not pro duce enough insulin; theref ore, the y mus t
take me dications tha t stimula te or replac e insulin pro duction , and the y mus t closely c ontrol the amount o f
sugars and c arbohydrates the y consume .
The gonads secrete se xual hormones , which are imp ortant in repro duction , and me diate both se xual
motiv ation and b ehavior . The f emale g onads are the o varies; the male g onads are the tes tes. Ovaries secrete
estrog ens and prog esterone , and the tes tes secrete androg ens, such as tes tosterone .98 3 • Biops ycholog y

Summary
3.1 Human Genetics
Genes are se quenc es o f DN A tha t code for a p articular trait . Diff erent v ersions o f a g ene are c alled
alleles —sometimes alleles c an b e clas sifie d as dominant or rec essive. A dominant allele alw ays results in the
dominant phenotyp e. In order to e xhibit a rec essive phenotyp e, an individual mus t be homo zygous f or the
recessive allele . Genes a ffect b oth ph ysical and ps ychologic al characteris tics. Ultima tely, how and when a g ene
is expres sed, and wha t the outc ome will b e—in terms o f both ph ysical and ps ychologic al characteris tics—is a
function o f the interaction b etween our g enes and our en vironments .
3.2 Cells of the Nervous System
Glia and neurons are the tw o cell typ es tha t mak e up the ner vous s ystem . While glia g enerally pla y supp orting
roles , the c ommunic ation b etween neurons is fundamental to all o f the functions as sociated with the ner vous
system . Neuronal c ommunic ation is made p ossible b y the neuron ’s sp ecializ ed structures . The soma c ontains
the c ell nucleus , and the dendrites e xtend from the soma in tree -like branches . The ax on is another major
extension o f the c ell b ody; ax ons are o ften c overed by a m yelin she ath, which incre ases the sp eed of
transmis sion o f neural impulses . At the end o f the ax on are terminal but tons tha t contain s ynaptic v esicles
fille d with neurotransmit ters .
Neuronal c ommunic ation is an electro chemic al ev ent. The dendrites c ontain rec eptors f or neurotransmit ters
rele ased by ne arby neurons . If the signals rec eived from other neurons are sufficiently s trong , an action
potential will tra vel do wn the length o f the ax on to the terminal but tons , resulting in the rele ase o f
neurotransmit ters into the s ynaptic cleft . Action p otentials op erate on the all-or -none principle and in volve102 3 • Summar y

the mo vement o f Na+and K+acros s the neuronal membrane .
Different neurotransmit ters are as sociated with diff erent functions . Often , psychologic al disorders in volve
imb alanc es in a giv en neurotransmit ter s ystem . Theref ore, psychotropic dr ugs are prescrib ed in an a ttempt to
bring the neurotransmit ters b ack into b alanc e. Drugs c an act either as a gonis ts or as anta gonis ts for a giv en
neurotransmit ter s ystem .
3.3 Parts of the Nervous System
The brain and spinal c ord mak e up the c entral ner vous s ystem . The p eripheral ner vous s ystem is c omprise d of
the soma tic and a utonomic ner vous s ystems . The soma tic ner vous s ystem transmits sensor y and motor
signals to and from the c entral ner vous s ystem . The a utonomic ner vous s ystem c ontrols the function o f our
organs and glands , and c an b e divide d into the s ymp athetic and p aras ymp athetic divisions . Symp athetic
activ ation prep ares us f or fight or flight , while p aras ymp athetic activ ation is as sociated with normal
functioning under relax ed conditions .
3.4 The Br ain and Spinal Cor d
The brain c onsis ts of two hemispheres , each c ontrolling the opp osite side o f the b ody. Each hemisphere c an b e
subdivide d into diff erent lob es: frontal , parietal , temp oral , and o ccipital . In addition to the lob es o f the
cerebral c ortex, the f orebrain includes the thalamus (sensor y rela y) and limbic s ystem (emotion and memor y
circuit). The midbrain c ontains the reticular f orma tion , which is imp ortant f or sleep and arousal , as w ell as the
subs tantia nigra and v entral tegmental are a. These s tructures are imp ortant f or mo vement , rew ard, and
addictiv e pro cesses. The hindbrain c ontains the s tructures o f the brains tem (me dulla, p ons, and midbrain),
which c ontrol a utoma tic functions lik e bre athing and blo od pres sure . The hindbrain also c ontains the
cereb ellum , which helps c oordina te mo vement and c ertain typ es o f memories .
Individuals with brain dama ge ha ve been s tudie d extensiv ely to pro vide inf orma tion a bout the role o f diff erent
areas o f the brain , and rec ent adv ances in technolog y allo w us to gle an similar inf orma tion b y ima ging brain
structure and function . These techniques include CT , PET , MRI, f MRI, and EEG .
3.5 The Endocrine System
The glands o f the endo crine s ystem secrete hormones to regula te normal b ody functions . The h ypothalamus
serves as the inter face between the ner vous s ystem and the endo crine s ystem , and it c ontrols the secretions o f
the pituitar y. The pituitar y ser ves as the mas ter gland , controlling the secretions o f all other glands . The
thyroid secretes th yroxine , which is imp ortant f or b asic meta bolic pro cesses and gro wth; the adrenal glands
secrete hormones in volved in the s tres s resp onse; the p ancre as secretes hormones tha t regula te blo od sug ar
levels; and the o varies and tes tes pro duce se x hormones tha t regula te se xual motiv ation and b ehavior .

4.1 What Is Consciousness?
LEARNING OBJEC TIVES
By the end o f this section, y ou wil l be able t o:
•Unders tand what is meant b y consciousnes s
•Explain ho w cir cadian rh ythms ar e involved in r egulating the sleep -wake cy cle, and ho w cir cadian cy cles can be
disrup ted
•Discus s the c oncept of sleep deb t
Consciousnes sdescrib es our a warenes s of internal and e xternal s timuli . Awarenes s of internal s timuli
includes f eeling p ain, hung er, thirs t, sleepines s, and b eing a ware o f our thoughts and emotions . Awarenes s of
external s timuli includes e xperienc es such as seeing the light from the sun , feeling the w armth o f a ro om, and
hearing the v oice of a friend .
We experienc e diff erent s tates o f consciousnes s and diff erent lev els o f awarenes s on a regular b asis . We might
even describ e consciousnes s as a c ontinuum tha t rang es from full a warenes s to a deep sleep .Sleep is a s tate
mark ed by rela tively lo w lev els o f ph ysical activity and re duced sensor y awarenes s tha t is dis tinct from p erio ds
of res t tha t occur during w akefulnes s.Wakefulnes sis characteriz ed by high lev els o f sensor y awarenes s,
thought , and b ehavior . Beyond b eing a wake or asleep , there are man y other s tates o f consciousnes s people
experienc e. These include da ydreaming , into xication , and unc onsciousnes s due to anes thesia. W e might also
experienc e unc onscious s tates o f being via dr ug-induc ed anes thesia f or me dical purp oses . Often , we are not
completely a ware o f our surroundings , even when w e are fully a wake. For ins tanc e, have you ev er da ydreame d
while driving home from w ork or scho ol without re ally thinking a bout the driv e itself ? You w ere c apable o f
engaging in the all o f the c omple x tasks in volved with op erating a motor v ehicle ev en though y ou w ere not
aware o f doing so . Man y of these pro cesses, like much o f psychologic al behavior , are ro oted in our biolog y.
Biological Rhythms
Biologic al rh ythms are internal rh ythms o f biologic al activity . A w oman ’s mens trual cy cle is an e xample o f a
biologic al rh ythm—a recurring , cyclical pattern o f bodily chang es. One c omplete mens trual cy cle tak es a bout
28 da ys—a lunar month—but man y biologic al cy cles are much shor ter. For e xample , body temp erature
fluctua tes cy clically o ver a 24-hour p erio d (Figure 4.2 ). Alertnes s is as sociated with higher b ody temp eratures ,
and sleepines s with lo wer b ody temp eratures .
FIGURE 4.2 This char t illustrates the cir cadian chang e in body t emper atur e over 28 hours in a gr oup o f eight y oung
men. Body t emper atur e rises thr oughout the w aking da y, peaking in the aft ernoon, and fal ls during sleep with the
lowest point oc curring during the v ery earl y morning hours .110 4 • S tates o f Consciousnes s

This p attern o f temp erature fluctua tion , which rep eats ev ery da y, is one e xample o f a circ adian rh ythm . A
circ adian rh ythm is a biologic al rh ythm tha t tak es plac e over a p erio d of about 24 hours . Our sleep -wake
cycle, which is link ed to our en vironment ’s na tural light -dark cy cle, is p erhaps the mos t ob vious e xample o f a
circ adian rh ythm , but w e also ha ve daily fluctua tions in he art rate, blo od pres sure , blo od sug ar, and b ody
temp erature . Some circ adian rh ythms pla y a role in chang es in our s tate of consciousnes s.
If we ha ve biologic al rh ythms , then is there some sor t ofbiologic al clo ck? In the brain , the h ypothalamus ,
which lies a bove the pituitar y gland , is a main c enter o f homeos tasis .Homeos tasis is the tendency to maintain

Problems With Cir cadian Rhythms
Generally , and f or mos t people , our circ adian cy cles are aligne d with the outside w orld . For e xample , mos t
people sleep during the night and are a wake during the da y. One imp ortant regula tor o f sleep -wake cy cles is
the hormone melatonin . The pine al gland , an endo crine s tructure lo cated inside the brain tha t rele ases
mela tonin , is thought to b e involved in the regula tion o f various biologic al rh ythms and o f the immune s ystem
during sleep (Hardeland , Pandi-P erumal , & C ardinali , 2006). Mela tonin rele ase is s timula ted by darknes s and
inhibite d by light .
There are individual diff erenc es in reg ard to our sleep -wake cy cle. For ins tanc e, some p eople w ould sa y the y
are morning p eople , while others w ould c onsider themselv es to b e night o wls. These individual diff erenc es in
circ adian p atterns o f activity are kno wn as a p erson ’s chronotyp e, and rese arch demons trates tha t morning
larks and night o wls diff er with reg ard to sleep regula tion ( Taillard , Philip , Coste, Sagaspe, & Bioulac , 2003).
Sleep regulat ion refers to the brain ’s control o f switching b etween sleep and w akefulnes s as w ell as

Disruptions of Normal Sleep
Whether lark , owl, or somewhere in b etween, there are situa tions in which a p erson ’s circ adian clo ck g ets out

misma tch b etween our internal circ adian cy cles and our en vironment . These s ymptoms include fa tigue ,
sluggishnes s, irrita bility , and insomnia (i.e., a c onsis tent difficulty in falling or s taying asleep f or a t least three
nights a w eek o ver a month ’s time) (R oth, 2007).
Individuals who do rota ting shift w ork are also lik ely to e xperienc e disr uptions in circ adian cy cles .Rotat ing
shift w ork refers to a w ork sche dule tha t chang es from e arly to la te on a daily or w eekly b asis . For e xample , a
person ma y work from 7:00 a.m . to 3:00 p .m. on Monda y, 3:00 a.m . to 11:00 a.m . on T uesda y, and 11:00 a.m . to
7:00 p .m. on W ednesda y. In such ins tanc es, the individual ’s sche dule chang es so fre quently tha t it b ecomes
difficult f or a normal circ adian rh ythm to b e maintaine d. This o ften results in sleeping problems , and it c an
lead to signs o f depres sion and anxiety . These kinds o f sche dules are c ommon f or individuals w orking in
health c are pro fessions and ser vice indus tries , and the y are as sociated with p ersis tent f eelings o f exhaustion
and a gita tion tha t can mak e someone more prone to making mis takes on the job (Gold et al ., 1992; P resser,
1995).
Rotating shift w ork has p ervasiv e eff ects on the liv es and e xperienc es o f individuals eng aged in tha t kind o f
work, which is cle arly illus trated in s tories rep orted in a qualita tive study tha t rese arche d the e xperienc es o f
middle -aged nurses who w orked rota ting shifts ( West, Boughton & B yrnes , 2009). Sev eral o f the nurses

nurses said ,
If you’ve had a p artner who do es w ork regular job 9 to 5 o ffice hours . . . the a bility to sp end time , good

While disr uptions in circ adian rh ythms c an ha ve neg ative conse quenc es, there are things w e can do to help us
realign our biologic al clo cks with the e xternal en vironment . Some o f these appro aches , such as using a bright

Insufficient Sleep
When p eople ha ve difficulty g etting sleep due to their w ork or the demands o f day-to-day life, the y ac cumula te
a sleep debt . A p erson with a sleep debt does not g et sufficient sleep on a chronic b asis . The c onse quenc es o f
sleep debt include decre ased lev els o f aler tnes s and mental efficiency . Interes tingly , sinc e the adv ent o f

having the darknes s lit up , we also suff er the c onse quenc es o f reduced amounts o f sleep b ecause w e are more
activ e during the night time hours than our anc estors w ere. As a result , man y of us sleep les s than 7–8 hours a

In addition , sleep depriv ation o ften results in depres sion-lik e symptoms . These eff ects c an o ccur as a function
of accumula ted sleep debt or in resp onse to more acute p erio ds o f sleep depriv ation . It ma y surprise y ou to
kno w tha t sleep depriv ation is as sociated with ob esity , incre ased blo od pres sure , incre ased lev els o f stres s
hormones , and re duced immune functioning (Banks & Ding es, 2007). A sleep depriv ed individual g enerally
will fall asleep more quickly than if the y were not sleep depriv ed. Some sleep -depriv ed individuals ha ve
difficulty s taying a wake when the y stop mo ving (e xample sit ting and w atching television or driving a c ar). Tha t
is wh y individuals suff ering from sleep depriv ation c an also put themselv es and others a t risk when the y put

little without app arent neg ative conse quenc es (e .g., gira ffes); y et some animals (e .g., ra ts) die a fter tw o weeks
of sleep depriv ation (Sieg el, 2008). Wh y do w e dev ote so much time to sleeping? Is it a bsolutely es sential tha t
we sleep? This section will c onsider these ques tions and e xplore v arious e xplana tions f or wh y we sleep .
What is Sleep?
You ha ve re ad tha t sleep is dis tinguishe d by low lev els o f ph ysical activity and re duced sensor y awarenes s. As
discus sed by Sieg el (2008), a definition o f sleep mus t also include mention o f the interpla y of the circ adian and
homeos tatic mechanisms tha t regula te sleep . Homeos tatic regula tion o f sleep is evidenc ed by sleep reb ound
following sleep depriv ation .Sleep reb ound refers to the fact tha t a sleep -depriv ed individual will fall asleep
more quickly during subse quent opp ortunities f or sleep . Sleep is characteriz ed by certain p atterns o f activity
of the brain tha t can b e visualiz ed using electro encephalograph y (EEG), and diff erent phases o f sleep c an b e
differentia ted using EEG as w ell.
Sleep -wake cy cles seem to b e controlle d by multiple brain are as acting in c onjunction with one another . Some
of these are as include the thalamus , the h ypothalamus , and the p ons. As alre ady mentione d, the
hypothalamus c ontains the SCN—the biologic al clo ck o f the b ody—in addition to other nuclei tha t, in
conjunction with the thalamus , regula te slo w-w ave sleep . The p ons is imp ortant f or regula ting rapid e ye
movement (REM) sleep (N ational Ins titutes o f He alth , n.d.).
Sleep is also as sociated with the secretion and regula tion o f a numb er o f hormones from sev eral endo crine
glands including: mela tonin , follicle s timula ting hormone (FSH), luteinizing hormone (LH), and gro wth
hormone (N ational Ins titutes o f He alth , n.d.). You ha ve re ad tha t the pine al gland rele ases mela tonin during
sleep ( Figure 4.6 ). Mela tonin is thought to b e involved in the regula tion o f various biologic al rh ythms and the
immune s ystem (Hardeland et al ., 2006). During sleep , the pituitar y gland secretes b oth FSH and LH which are
imp ortant in regula ting the repro ductiv e system (Chris tensen et al ., 2012; So fikitis et al ., 2008). The pituitar y
gland also secretes gro wth hormone , during sleep , which pla ys a role in ph ysical gro wth and ma tura tion as
well as other meta bolic pro cesses (Bar tke, Sun , & Long o, 2013).
FIGURE 4.6 The pineal and pituitar y glands secr ete a number o f hormones during sleep .
Why Do W e Sleep?
Given the c entral role tha t sleep pla ys in our liv es and the numb er o f adv erse c onse quenc es tha t ha ve been
associated with sleep depriv ation , one w ould think tha t we would ha ve a cle ar unders tanding o f wh y it is tha t
we sleep . Unf ortuna tely, this is not the c ase; ho wever, sev eral h ypotheses ha ve been prop osed to e xplain the
function o f sleep .4.2 • Sleep and Wh y We Sleep 115
Adaptive Function of Sleep
One p opular h ypothesis o f sleep inc orporates the p ersp ectiv e of evolutionar y ps ycholog y.Evolut ionar y
psycholog yis a discipline tha t studies ho w univ ersal p atterns o f behavior and c ognitiv e pro cesses ha ve
evolved over time as a result o fnatural selection . Varia tions and adapta tions in c ognition and b ehavior mak e
individuals more or les s suc cessful in repro ducing and p assing their g enes to their o ffspring . One h ypothesis
from this p ersp ectiv e might argue tha t sleep is es sential to res tore resourc es tha t are e xpende d during the da y.
Just as b ears hib erna te in the winter when resourc es are sc arce, perhaps p eople sleep a t night to re duce their
energ y expenditures . While this is an intuitiv e explana tion o f sleep , there is lit tle rese arch tha t supp orts this
explana tion . In fact , it has b een sugg ested tha t there is no re ason to think tha t energ etic demands c ould not b e
addres sed with p erio ds o f res t and inactivity (F rank , 2006; Rial et al ., 2007), and some rese arch has actually
found a neg ative correla tion b etween energ etic demands and the amount o f time sp ent sleeping (C apellini ,
Barton, McN amara, P reston, & Nunn , 2008).
Another ev olutionar y hypothesis o f sleep holds tha t our sleep p atterns ev olved as an adaptiv e resp onse to
predatory risks , which incre ase in darknes s. Thus w e sleep in sa fe are as to re duce the chanc e of harm . Again,
this is an intuitiv e and app ealing e xplana tion f or wh y we sleep . Perhaps our anc estors sp ent e xtende d perio ds
of time asleep to re duce attention to themselv es from p otential pre dators . Comp arative rese arch indic ates,
however, tha t the rela tionship tha t exists between pre datory risk and sleep is v ery comple x and e quiv ocal.
Some rese arch sugg ests tha t species tha t fac e higher pre datory risks sleep f ewer hours than other sp ecies
(Capellini et al ., 2008), while other rese archers sugg est there is no rela tionship b etween the amount o f time a
given sp ecies sp ends in deep sleep and its pre dation risk (Lesk u, Roth, Amlaner , & Lima, 2006).
It is quite p ossible tha t sleep ser ves no single univ ersally adaptiv e function , and diff erent sp ecies ha ve ev olved
different p atterns o f sleep in resp onse to their unique ev olutionar y pres sures . While w e ha ve discus sed the
negative outc omes as sociated with sleep depriv ation , it should b e pointe d out tha t there are man y benefits tha t
are as sociated with ade qua te amounts o f sleep . A f ew such b enefits lis ted by the N ational Sleep F ounda tion
(n.d.) include maintaining he alth y weight , lowering s tres s lev els, impro ving mo od, and incre asing motor
coordina tion , as w ell as a numb er o f benefits rela ted to c ognition and memor y forma tion .
Cognitive Function of Sleep
Another theor y reg arding wh y we sleep in volves sleep ’s imp ortanc e for c ognitiv e function and memor y
forma tion (Ra ttenb org, Lesk u, Mar tine z-Gonzale z, & Lima, 2007). Indee d, we kno w sleep depriv ation results in
disr uptions in c ognition and memor y deficits (Bro wn, 2012), le ading to imp airments in our a bilities to
maintain a ttention , mak e decisions , and rec all long-term memories . Moreo ver, these imp airments b ecome
more sev ere as the amount o f sleep depriv ation incre ases (A lhola & P olo-Kantola, 2007). F urthermore , slo w-

Sleep is not a unif orm s tate of being . Ins tead, sleep is c omp osed of sev eral diff erent s tages tha t can b e

NREM sleep , typic ally f ollowed by REM sleep . In this section , we will discus s each o f these s tages o f sleep and

In terms o f brain w ave activity , stage 1 sleep is as sociated with b oth alpha and theta w aves. The e arly p ortion o f

sleep; in fact , people o ften rep ort tha t the y ha ve not b een asleep if the y are a woken during s tage 1 sleep .

As w e mo ve into stage 2 sleep , the b ody g oes into a s tate of deep relaxa tion . Theta w aves still domina te the
activity o f the brain , but the y are interr upte d by brief burs ts of activity kno wn as sleep spindles ( Figure 4.9 ). A
sleep spindle is a rapid burs t of higher fre quency brain w aves tha t ma y be imp ortant f or le arning and memor y

FIGURE 4.9 Stag e 2 sleep is char acterized b y the appear ance of both sleep spindles and K -comple xes.
NREM s tage 3 sleep is often ref erre d to as deep sleep or slo w-w ave sleep b ecause this s tage is characteriz ed by

Dreams and their as sociated me anings v ary acros s diff erent cultures and p erio ds o f time . By the la te 19th
centur y, Austrian ps ychia trist Sigmund Freud had b ecome c onvinc ed tha t dre ams represente d an opp ortunity
to gain ac cess to the unc onscious . By analyzing dre ams , Freud thought p eople c ould incre ase self -awarenes s
and g ain v alua ble insight to help them de al with the problems the y fac ed in their liv es. Freud made
distinctions b etween the manif est content and the la tent c ontent o f dre ams .Manif est content is the actual
content , or s toryline , of a dre am.Latent c ontent , on the other hand , ref ers to the hidden me aning o f a dre am.
For ins tanc e, if a w oman dre ams a bout b eing chase d by a snak e, Freud might ha ve argue d tha t this represents
the w oman ’s fear o f sexual intimacy , with the snak e ser ving as a s ymb ol of a man ’s penis .
Freud w as not the only theoris t to f ocus on the c ontent o f dre ams . The 20th c entur y Swis s ps ychia trist Carl
Jung b eliev ed tha t dre ams allo wed us to tap into the c ollectiv e unc onscious . The collect ive unc onscious , as
describ ed byJung , is a theoretic al rep ositor y of inf orma tion he b eliev ed to b e share d by ev eryone. According
to Jung , certain s ymb ols in dre ams reflecte d univ ersal archetyp es with me anings tha t are similar f or all p eople
regardles s of culture or lo cation .
The sleep and dre aming rese archer R osalind C artwright , however, believ es tha t dre ams simply reflect lif e
events tha t are imp ortant to the dre amer . Unlik e Freud and J ung , Cartwright ’s ide as a bout dre aming ha ve
found empiric al supp ort. For e xample , she and her c olleagues publishe d a s tudy in which w omen g oing
through div orce were ask ed sev eral times o ver a fiv e month p erio d to rep ort the degree to which their f ormer
spouses w ere on their minds . These same w omen w ere a wakened during REM sleep in order to pro vide a

which w omen thought a bout their f ormer sp ouses during w aking hours and the numb er o f times their f ormer
spouses app eared as characters in their dre ams (C artwright , Agargun , Kirkb y, & F riedman , 2006). R ecent

John Hobson cites rese arch on lucid dre ams as an opp ortunity to b etter unders tand dre aming in g eneral .
Lucid dre ams are dre ams in which c ertain asp ects o f wakefulnes s are maintaine d during a dre am s tate. In a

Man y people e xperienc e dis turb ances in their sleep a t some p oint in their liv es. Dep ending on the p opula tion
and sleep disorder b eing s tudie d, between 30% and 50% o f the p opula tion suff ers from a sleep disorder a t
some p oint in their liv es (Bixler , Kales , Solda tos, Kaels , & He aley, 1979; Hos sain & Shapiro , 2002; Oha yon,
1997, 2002; Oha yon & R oth, 2002). This section will describ e sev eral sleep disorders as w ell as some o f their
treatment options .
Insomnia
Insomnia, a c onsis tent difficulty in falling or s taying asleep , is the mos t common o f the sleep disorders .
Individuals with insomnia o ften e xperienc e long dela ys between the times tha t the y go to b ed and actually fall
asleep . In addition , these individuals ma y wake up sev eral times during the night only to find tha t the y ha ve
difficulty g etting b ack to sleep . As mentione d earlier , one o f the criteria f or insomnia in volves e xperiencing
these s ymptoms f or a t least three nights a w eek f or a t least one month ’s time (R oth, 2007).
It is not unc ommon f or p eople suff ering from insomnia to e xperienc e incre ased lev els o f anxiety a bout their
inability to fall asleep . This b ecomes a self -perpetua ting cy cle b ecause incre ased anxiety le ads to incre ased
arousal , and higher lev els o f arousal mak e the prosp ect o f falling asleep ev en more unlik ely. Chronic insomnia
is almos t alw ays as sociated with f eeling o vertired and ma y be as sociated with s ymptoms o f depres sion .
There ma y be man y factors tha t contribute to insomnia, including a ge, drug use , exercise , mental s tatus, and
bedtime routines . Not surprisingly , insomnia tre atment ma y tak e one o f sev eral diff erent appro aches . People
who suff er from insomnia might limit their use o f stimulant dr ugs (such as c affeine) or incre ase their amount
of ph ysical exercise during the da y. Some p eople might turn to o ver-the -counter (O TC) or prescrib ed sleep
medications to help them sleep , but this should b e done sp aringly b ecause man y sleep me dications result in
dep endenc e and alter the na ture o f the sleep cy cle, and the y can incre ase insomnia o ver time . Those who
continue to ha ve insomnia, p articularly if it a ffects their quality o f life, should seek pro fessional tre atment .
Some f orms o f psychotherap y, such as c ognitiv e-behavioral therap y, can help suff erers o f insomnia.
Cognit ive-beha vioral therap yis a typ e of psychotherap y tha t focuses on c ognitiv e pro cesses and problem4.4 • Sleep P roblems and Disor ders 121
behaviors . The tre atment o f insomnia lik ely w ould include s tres s mana gement techniques and chang es in
problema tic b ehaviors tha t could c ontribute to insomnia (e .g., sp ending more w aking time in b ed). C ognitiv e-
behavioral therap y has b een demons trated to b e quite eff ectiv e in tre ating insomnia (Sa vard, Simard , Ivers, &

Solutions to Support Healthy Sleep
Has something lik e this e ver happened t o you? My sophomor e college housemat e got so s tressed out during
finals sophomor e year he dr ank almos t a whole bot tle o f Nyquil t o try to fal l asleep . When he t old me , I made him
go see the c ollege ther apis t.
Man y college students s trug gle g etting the r ecommended 7–9 hours o f sleep each night. Ho wever, for some , it's
not because o f all-night par tying or lat e-night s tudy ses sions . It's simpl y that the y feel so o verwhelmed and
stressed that the y cannot fal l asleep or s tay asleep . One or tw o nights o f sleep difficul ty is not unusual , but if y ou
experienc e an ything mor e than that, y ou should seek a doct or's advic e.
Here are some tips t o maintain heal thy sleep:
•Stick t o a sleep schedule , even on the w eekends . Try going t o bed and w aking up at the same time e very da y
to keep y our biological clock in s ync so y our body g ets in the habit o f sleeping e very night.
•Avoid an ything s timulating f or an hour bef ore bed. That includes e xercise and bright light fr om de vices.
•Exercise dail y.
•Avoid naps .
•Keep y our bedr oom t emper atur e betw een 60 and 67 degr ees. People sleep bet ter in c ooler t emper atur es.
•Avoid alc ohol , cig arettes, caff eine , and hea vy meals bef ore bed. It ma y feel lik e alc ohol helps y ou sleep , but
it actual ly disrup ts REM sleep and leads t o frequent a wakenings . Hea vy meals ma y mak e you sleep y, but
they can also lead t o frequent a wakenings due t o gastric dis tress.
•If you cannot fal l asleep , lea ve your bed and do something else until y ou feel tir ed ag ain. T rain y our body t o
associat e the bed with sleeping r ather than other activities lik e studying , eating , or w atching t elevision
shows.
Parasomnias
Aparasomnia is one o f a group o f sleep disorders in which un wante d, disr uptiv e motor activity and/or
experienc es during sleep pla y a role . Parasomnias c an o ccur in either REM or NREM phases o f sleep .
Sleep walking , res tless leg s yndrome , and night terrors are all e xamples o f parasomnias (Maho wald & Schenck ,
2000).
Sleepw alking
Insleep walking , or somnambulism , the sleep er eng ages in rela tively c omple x behaviors ranging from
wandering a bout to driving an a utomobile . During p erio ds o f sleep walking , sleep ers o ften ha ve their e yes
open, but the y are not resp onsiv e to a ttempts to c ommunic ate with them . Sleep walking mos t often o ccurs
during slo w-w ave sleep , but it c an o ccur a t an y time during a sleep p erio d in some a ffecte d individuals
(Maho wald & Schenck , 2000).
Historic ally, somnambulism has b een tre ated with a v ariety o f pharmac otherapies ranging from
benzodiaz epines to antidepres sants . Ho wever, the suc cess rate of such tre atments is ques tiona ble.
Guillemina ult et al . (2005) f ound tha t sleep walking w as not allevia ted with the use o f benzodiaz epines .
However, all o f their somnambulis tic p atients who also suff ered from sleep -rela ted bre athing problems

A Sleep walking Def ense?
On Januar y 16, 1997, Sc ott Falater sat do wn t o dinner with his wif e and childr en and t old them about difficul ties
he w as e xperiencing on a pr oject at w ork. Aft er dinner , he pr epar ed some mat erials t o use in leading a chur ch
youth gr oup the f ollowing morning , and then he at temp ted to repair the famil y’s swimming pool pump bef ore
retiring t o bed. The f ollowing morning , he a woke to barking dogs and unfamiliar v oices fr om do wns tairs . As he
went t o investigate what w as g oing on, he w as met b y a gr oup o f polic e officers who arr ested him f or the mur der
of his wif e (Car twright, 2004; CNN, 1999).
Yarmila F alater’s body w as found in the famil y’s pool with 44 s tab w ounds . A neighbor cal led the polic e aft er
witnes sing F alater standing o ver his wif e’s body bef ore dragging her int o the pool . Upon a sear ch o f the pr emises ,
polic e found blood-s tained clothes and a bloody knif e in the trunk o f Falater’s car , and he had blood s tains on his
neck.
Remark ably, Falater insis ted that he had no r ecollection o f hur ting his wif e in an y way. His childr en and his wif e’s
parents al l agr eed that F alater had an e xcellent r elationship with his wif e and the y couldn ’t think o f a reason that
would pr ovide an y sor t of motiv e to mur der her (Car twright, 2004).
Scott Falater had a his tory of regular episodes o f sleep walking as a child, and he had e ven beha ved violentl y
toward his sis ter onc e when she tried t o prevent him fr om lea ving their home in his pajamas during a
sleep walking episode . He suff ered fr om no appar ent anat omical br ain anomalies or ps ychological disor ders . It
appear ed that Sc ott Falater had kil led his wif e in his sleep , or at leas t, that is the def ense he used when he w as
tried f or his wif e’s mur der (Car twright, 2004; CNN, 1999). In F alater’s case , a jur y found him g uilty of firs t degr ee
mur der in June o f 1999 (CNN, 1999); ho wever, ther e are other mur der cases wher e the sleep walking def ense
has been used suc cessfully. As scar y as it sounds , man y sleep r esear chers belie ve that homicidal sleep walking is
possible in individuals suff ering fr om the types o f sleep disor ders described belo w (Br ought on et al ., 1994;
Cartwright, 2004; Maho wald, Schenck, & Cr amer Bornemann, 2005; P ressman, 2007).
REM Sleep Behavior Disor der (RBD)
REM sleep b eha vior disorder (RBD) occurs when the muscle p araly sis as sociated with the REM sleep phase
does not o ccur. Individuals who suff er from RBD ha ve high lev els o f ph ysical activity during REM sleep ,
especially during dis turbing dre ams . These b ehaviors v ary widely , but the y can include kicking , punching ,
scra tching , yelling , and b ehaving lik e an animal tha t has b een frightene d or a ttack ed. People who suff er from
this disorder c an injure themselv es or their sleeping p artners when eng aging in these b ehaviors . Furthermore ,
these typ es o f behaviors ultima tely disr upt sleep , although a ffecte d individuals ha ve no memories tha t these
behaviors ha ve occurre d (Arnulf, 2012).
This disorder is as sociated with a numb er o f neuro degenera tive dise ases such as P arkinson ’s dise ase. In fact ,
this rela tionship is so robus t tha t some view the presenc e of RBD as a p otential aid in the dia gnosis and
treatment o f a numb er o f neuro degenera tive dise ases (F erini-Strambi , 2011). Clonaz epam, an anti-anxiety
medication with se dative prop erties, is mos t often use d to tre at RBD . It is adminis tere d alone or in c onjunction
with doses o f mela tonin (the hormone secrete d by the pine al gland). As p art of tre atment , the sleeping
environment is o ften mo difie d to mak e it a sa fer plac e for those suff ering from RBD (Zangini , Calandra-
Buona ura, Grimaldi , & C ortelli , 2011).
Other P arasomnias
A person with restles s leg syndrome has unc omf ortable sensa tions in the legs during p erio ds o f inactivity or
when tr ying to fall asleep . This disc omf ort is reliev ed by delib erately mo ving the legs , which , not surprisingly ,
contributes to difficulty in falling or s taying asleep . Restless leg s yndrome is quite c ommon and has b eenDIG DEEPER4.4 • Sleep P roblems and Disor ders 123
associated with a numb er o f other me dical dia gnoses , such as chronic kidne y dise ase and dia betes (Maho wald
& Schenck , 2000). There are a v ariety o f drugs tha t tre at res tless leg s yndrome: b enzodiaz epines , opia tes, and
antic onvulsants (R estless Legs Syndrome F ounda tion , n.d.).
Night terrors result in a sense o f panic in the suff erer and are o ften ac comp anie d by scre ams and a ttempts to
escape from the imme diate en vironment (Maho wald & Schenck , 2000). A lthough individuals suff ering from
night terrors app ear to b e awake, the y generally ha ve no memories o f the ev ents tha t occurre d, and a ttempts to
console them are ineff ectiv e. Typic ally, individuals suff ering from night terrors will fall b ack asleep a gain
within a shor t time . Night terrors app arently o ccur during the NREM phase o f sleep (P rovini , Tinup er, Bisulli , &
Lagaresi , 2011). Generally , tre atment f or night terrors is unnec essary unles s there is some underlying me dical
or ps ychologic al condition tha t is c ontributing to the night terrors (Ma yo Clinic , n.d.).
Sleep Apnea
Sleep apne ais define d by episo des during which a sleep er’s bre athing s tops . These episo des c an las t 10–20
seconds or long er and o ften are as sociated with brief p erio ds o f arousal . While individuals suff ering from sleep
apne a ma y not b e aware o f these rep eated disr uptions in sleep , the y do e xperienc e incre ased lev els o f fatigue .
Man y individuals dia gnose d with sleep apne a firs t seek tre atment b ecause their sleeping p artners indic ate
that the y snore loudly and/or s top bre athing f or e xtende d perio ds o f time while sleeping (Henr y & R osenthal ,
2013). Sleep apne a is much more c ommon in o verweight p eople and is o ften as sociated with loud snoring .
Surprisingly , sleep apne a ma y exacerbate cardio vascular dise ase (Sánche z-de-la-T orre , Camp os-Rodrigue z, &
Barb é, 2012). While sleep apne a is les s common in thin p eople , anyone, reg ardles s of their w eight , who snores
loudly or g asps f or air while sleeping , should b e check ed for sleep apne a.
While p eople are o ften una ware o f their sleep apne a, the y are k eenly a ware o f some o f the adv erse
conse quenc es o f insufficient sleep . Consider a p atient who b eliev ed tha t as a result o f his sleep apne a he “had
three c ar ac cidents in six w eeks . The y were ALL m y fault. Tw o of them I didn ’t even kno w I w as in volved in
until a fterwards” (Henr y & R osenthal , 2013, p . 52). It is not unc ommon f or p eople suff ering from undia gnose d
or untre ated sleep apne a to f ear tha t their c areers will b e affecte d by the lack o f sleep , illus trated by this
statement from another p atient , “I’m in a job where there ’s a premium on b eing mentally aler t. I w as re ally
sleep y… and ha ving trouble c oncentra ting …. It w as g etting to the p oint where it w as kind o f scary” (Henr y &
Rosenthal , 2013, p . 52).
There are tw o typ es o f sleep apne a: obs tructiv e sleep apne a and c entral sleep apne a.Obs tructive sleep apne a
occurs when an individual ’s air way becomes blo cked during sleep , and air is prev ente d from entering the
lungs . Incentral sleep apne a, disr uption in signals sent from the brain tha t regula te bre athing c ause p erio ds
of interr upte d bre athing ( White , 2005).
One o f the mos t common tre atments f or sleep apne a involves the use o f a sp ecial devic e during sleep . A
continuous p osit ive air way pres sure (CP AP) devic e includes a mask tha t fits o ver the sleep er’s nose and
mouth , which is c onnecte d to a pump tha t pumps air into the p erson ’s air ways, forcing them to remain op en,
as sho wn in Figure 4.13 . Some new er CP AP masks are smaller and c over only the nose . This tre atment option
has pro ven to b e eff ectiv e for p eople suff ering from mild to sev ere c ases o f sleep apne a (McDaid et al ., 2009).
However, alterna tive tre atment options are b eing e xplore d because c onsis tent c omplianc e by users o f CP AP
devic es is a problem . Recently , a new EP AP (e xpira tory positiv e air pres sure) devic e has sho wn promise in
double -blind trials as one such alterna tive (Berr y, Kryger, & Mas sie, 2011).124 4 • S tates o f Consciousnes s

SIDS
Insudden inf ant de ath syndrome (SIDS )an infant s tops bre athing during sleep and dies . Infants y oung er
than 12 months app ear to b e at the highes t risk f or SIDS, and b oys ha ve a gre ater risk than girls . A numb er o f
risk factors ha ve been as sociated with SIDS including prema ture bir th, smoking within the home , and
hyperthermia. There ma y also b e diff erenc es in b oth brain s tructure and function in infants tha t die from SIDS
(Berk owitz, 2012; Ma ge & Donner , 2006; Thach , 2005).
The subs tantial amount o f rese arch on SIDS has le d to a numb er o f rec ommenda tions to p arents to protect
their children ( Figure 4.14 ). For one , rese arch sugg ests tha t infants should b e plac ed on their b acks when put
down to sleep , and their cribs should not c ontain an y items which p ose suff ocation thre ats, such as blank ets,
pillo ws or p adde d crib bump ers (cushions tha t cover the b ars o f a crib). Infants should not ha ve caps plac ed on
their he ads when put do wn to sleep in order to prev ent o verhe ating , and p eople in the child ’s household should
abstain from smoking in the home . Recommenda tions lik e these ha ve help ed to decre ase the numb er o f infant
deaths from SIDS in rec ent y ears (Mitchell , 2009; T ask F orce on Sudden Infant De ath Syndrome , 2011).
FIGURE 4.14 The Saf e to Sleep campaign educat es the public about ho w to minimiz e risk fact ors as sociat ed with
SIDS. This campaign is sponsor ed in par t by the National Ins titut e of Child Heal th and Human De velopment.
Nar colepsy
Unlik e the other sleep disorders describ ed in this section , a p erson with narc olepsy cannot resis t falling
asleep a t inopp ortune times . These sleep episo des are o ften as sociated with cataple xy, which is a lack o f
muscle tone or muscle w eaknes s, and in some c ases in volves c omplete p araly sis o f the v oluntar y muscles .
This is similar to the kind o f paraly sis e xperienc ed by he alth y individuals during REM sleep (B urgess &
Scammell , 2012; Hishika wa & Shimizu , 1995; L uppi et al ., 2011). N arcoleptic episo des tak e on other f eatures
of REM sleep . For e xample , around one third o f individuals dia gnose d with narc oleps y experienc e vivid ,
dream-lik e hallucina tions during narc oleptic a ttacks (Chokro verty, 2010).
Surprisingly , narc oleptic episo des are o ften trigg ered by states o f heightene d arousal or s tres s. The typic al
episo de c an las t from a minute or tw o to half an hour . Onc e awakened from a narc oleptic a ttack , people rep ort
that the y feel refreshe d (Chokro verty, 2010). Ob viously , regular narc oleptic episo des c ould inter fere with the
ability to p erform one ’s job or c omplete scho olwork, and in some situa tions , narc oleps y can result in
signific ant harm and injur y (e.g., driving a c ar or op erating machiner y or other p otentially dang erous
equipment).4.4 • Sleep P roblems and Disor ders 125
Generally , narc oleps y is tre ated using ps ychomotor s timulant dr ugs, such as amphetamines (Mignot , 2012).
These dr ugs promote incre ased lev els o f neural activity . Narcoleps y is as sociated with re duced lev els o f the
signaling molecule h ypocretin in some are as o f the brain (De la Herrán-Arita & Dr ucker-Colín , 2012; Han ,
2012), and the traditional s timulant dr ugs do not ha ve direct eff ects on this s ystem . Theref ore, it is quite lik ely
that new me dications tha t are dev elop ed to tre at narc oleps y will b e designe d to targ et the h ypocretin s ystem .
There is a tremendous amount o f varia bility among suff erers , both in terms o f ho w symptoms o f narc oleps y
manif est and the eff ectiv enes s of currently a vailable tre atment options . This is illus trated by McC arty’s (2010)
case s tudy o f a 50- year-old w oman who sought help f or the e xcessive sleepines s during normal w aking hours
that she had e xperienc ed for sev eral y ears. She indic ated tha t she had fallen asleep a t inappropria te or
dang erous times , including while e ating , while so cializing with friends , and while driving her c ar. During
perio ds o f emotional arousal , the w oman c omplaine d tha t she f elt some w eaknes s in the right side o f her b ody.
Although she did not e xperienc e an y dre am-lik e hallucina tions , she w as dia gnose d with narc oleps y as a result
of sleep tes ting . In her c ase, the fact tha t her c ataple xy w as c onfine d to the right side o f her b ody w as quite
unusual . Early a ttempts to tre at her c ondition with a s timulant dr ug alone w ere unsuc cessful. Ho wever, when a
stimulant dr ug w as use d in c onjunction with a p opular antidepres sant , her c ondition impro ved drama tically.

clinicians to dia gnose individuals suff ering from v arious ps ychologic al disorders . Drug use disorders are
addictiv e disorders , and the criteria f or sp ecific subs tanc e (dr ug) use disorders are describ ed in DSM-5. A
person who has a subs tanc e use disorder o ften uses more o f the subs tanc e than the y originally intende d to and
continues to use tha t subs tanc e despite e xperiencing signific ant adv erse c onse quenc es. In individuals
diagnose d with a subs tanc e use disorder , there is a c ompulsiv e pattern o f drug use tha t is o ften as sociated with
both ph ysical and ps ychologic al dep endenc e.
Physical dep endenc einvolves chang es in normal b odily functions —the user will e xperienc e withdra wal from
the dr ug up on c essation o f use . In c ontras t, a p erson who has psychologic al dep endenc ehas an emotional ,
rather than ph ysical, nee d for the dr ug and ma y use the dr ug to reliev e ps ychologic al dis tres s.Toleranc eis
link ed to ph ysiologic al dep endenc e, and it o ccurs when a p erson re quires more and more dr ug to achiev e
effects previously e xperienc ed at lower doses . Toleranc e can c ause the user to incre ase the amount o f drug
used to a dang erous lev el—even to the p oint o f overdose and de ath.
Drugwithdra walincludes a v ariety o f neg ative symptoms e xperienc ed when dr ug use is disc ontinue d. These
symptoms usually are opp osite o f the eff ects o f the dr ug. For e xample , withdra wal from se dative dr ugs o ften
produces unple asant arousal and a gita tion . In addition to withdra wal, man y individuals who are dia gnose d
with subs tanc e use disorders will also dev elop toleranc e to these subs tanc es. Psychologic al dep endenc e, or
drug cra ving , is a rec ent addition to the dia gnos tic criteria f or subs tanc e use disorder in DSM-5. This is an

Alcohol and Other Depr essants
Ethanol , which w e commonly ref er to as alc ohol , is in a clas s of psychoactiv e dr ugs kno wn as depres sants4.5 • Subs tanc e Use and Abuse 127
(Figure 4.15 ). A depres sant is a dr ug tha t tends to suppres s central ner vous s ystem activity . Other depres sants
include b arbitura tes and b enzodiaz epines . These dr ugs share in c ommon their a bility to ser ve as a gonis ts of
the g amma-Aminobutyric acid (G ABA) neurotransmit ter s ystem . Bec ause G ABA has a quieting eff ect on the
brain , GABA agonis ts also ha ve a quieting eff ect; these typ es o f drugs are o ften prescrib ed to tre at both anxiety
and insomnia.
FIGURE 4.15 The GAB A-gated chloride (Cl–) channel is embedded in the c ell membr ane o f certain neur ons. The
channel has mul tiple r eceptor sit es wher e alc ohol , barbitur ates, and benz odiaz epines bind t o exert their eff ects . The
binding o f these molecules opens the chloride channel , allowing neg atively-char ged chloride ions (Cl–) into the
neur on's cell body . Changing its char ge in a neg ative dir ection pushes the neur onawayfrom firing; thus , activ ating a
GAB A neur on has a quieting eff ect on the br ain.
Acute alc ohol adminis tration results in a v ariety o f chang es to c onsciousnes s. At rather lo w doses , alc ohol use
is as sociated with f eelings o f euphoria. As the dose incre ases , people rep ort feeling se dated. Generally , alc ohol
is as sociated with decre ases in re action time and visual acuity , lowered lev els o f aler tnes s, and re duction in
behavioral c ontrol . With e xcessive alc ohol use , a p erson might e xperienc e a c omplete los s of consciousnes s
and/or difficulty rememb ering ev ents tha t occurre d during a p erio d of into xication (McKim & Hanc ock, 2013).
In addition , if a pregnant p erson c onsumes alc ohol , their infant ma y be born with a clus ter o f bir th def ects and
symptoms c ollectiv ely c alled fetal alc ohol sp ectr um disorder (F ASD) or f etal alc ohol s yndrome (F AS).
With rep eated use o f man y central ner vous s ystem depres sants , such as alc ohol , a p erson b ecomes ph ysically
dep endent up on the subs tanc e and will e xhibit signs o f both toleranc e and withdra wal. Psychologic al
dep endenc e on these dr ugs is also p ossible . Theref ore, the a buse p otential o f central ner vous s ystem
depres sants is rela tively high .
Drug withdra wal is usually an a versiv e experienc e, and it c an b e a lif e-thre atening pro cess in individuals who
have a long his tory of very high doses o f alc ohol and/or b arbitura tes. This is o f such c oncern tha t people who
are tr ying to o vercome addiction to these subs tanc es should only do so under me dical sup ervision .128 4 • S tates o f Consciousnes s

Stimulants
Stimulants are dr ugs tha t tend to incre ase o verall lev els o f neural activity . Man y of these dr ugs act as a gonis ts
of the dop amine neurotransmit ter s ystem . Dop amine activity is o ften as sociated with rew ard and cra ving;
theref ore, drugs tha t affect dop amine neurotransmis sion o ften ha ve abuse lia bility . Drugs in this c ategory
include c ocaine , amphetamines (including methamphetamine), c athinones (i .e., bath salts), MDMA (ecs tasy),
nicotine , and c affeine .
Cocaine c an b e tak en in multiple w ays. While man y users snor t cocaine , intra venous injection and inhala tion
(smoking ) are also c ommon . The freeb ase v ersion o f cocaine , kno wn as crack , is a p otent , smoka ble v ersion o f
the dr ug. Lik e man y other s timulants , cocaine a goniz es the dop amine neurotransmit ter s ystem b y blo cking
the reuptak e of dop amine in the neuronal s ynapse .
Methamphetamine
Methamphetamine in its smok able f orm, o ften cal led “ crystal meth ” due t o its r esemblanc e to rock cr ystal
formations , is highl y addictiv e. The smok able f orm r eaches the br ain v ery quickl y to produc e an int ense euphoria
that dis sipat es almos t as fas t as it arriv es, promp ting users t o continuing taking the drug . Users o ften c onsume
the drug e very few hours acr oss da ys-long bing es cal led "runs ," in which the user f orgoes f ood and sleep . The
availability o f pot ent and ine xpensiv e forms o f methamphetamine , coupled with a lo wer risk o f overdose than
with opiat e drugs , is making cr ystal meth a popular choic e among drug users t oday (NID A, 2019). Using cr ystal
meth poses a number o f serious long-t erm heal th is sues , including dental pr oblems (o ften cal led "meth mouth "),
skin abr asions caused b y excessive scr atching , memor y los s, sleep pr oblems , violent beha vior, par anoia , and
hallucinations . Methamphetamine addiction pr oduc es an int ense cr aving that is difficul t to treat.
Amphetamines ha ve a mechanism o f action quite similar to c ocaine in tha t the y blo ck the reuptak e of
dop amine in addition to s timula ting its rele ase ( Figure 4.16 ). While amphetamines are o ften a buse d, the y are
also c ommonly prescrib ed to p eople dia gnose d with a ttention deficit h yperactivity disorder (ADHD). It ma y
seem c ounterintuitiv e tha t stimulant me dications are prescrib ed to tre at a disorder tha t involves h yperactivity ,
but the therap eutic eff ect c omes from incre ases in neurotransmit ter activity within c ertain are as o f the brain
associated with impulse c ontrol . These brain are as include the prefrontal c ortex and b asal g anglia.DIG DEEPER4.5 • Subs tanc e Use and Abuse 129
FIGURE 4.16 As one o f their mechanisms o f action, c ocaine and amphetamines block the r euptake of dopamine

In rec ent y ears, methamphetamine (meth) use has b ecome incre asingly widespre ad.Methamphetamine is a
type of amphetamine tha t can b e made from ingre dients tha t are re adily a vailable (e .g., me dications
containing pseudo ephe drine , a c omp ound f ound in man y over-the -counter c old and flu reme dies). Despite
recent chang es in la ws designe d to mak e obtaining pseudo ephe drine more difficult , methamphetamine
continues to b e an e asily ac cessible and rela tively ine xpensiv e dr ug option (Shukla, C rump , & Chrisc o, 2012).
Stimulant users seek a euphoric high , feelings o f intense ela tion and ple asure , esp ecially in those users who
take the dr ug via intra venous injection or smoking . MDMA (3.4-methelyne dioxy-methamphetamine ,
commonly kno wn as " ecstasy" or "Molly ") is a mild s timulant with p erception-altering eff ects . It is typic ally
consume d in pill f orm . Users e xperienc e incre ased energ y, feelings o f ple asure , and emotional w armth .
Repeated use o f these s timulants c an ha ve signific ant adv erse c onse quenc es. Users c an e xperienc e ph ysical
symptoms tha t include na usea, elev ated blo od pres sure , and incre ased he art rate. In addition , these dr ugs c an
cause f eelings o f anxiety , hallucina tions , and p aranoia (F iorentini et al ., 2011). N ormal brain functioning is
altere d after rep eated use o f these dr ugs. For e xample , rep eated use c an le ad to o verall depletion among the
mono amine neurotransmit ters (dop amine , norepinephrine , and serotonin). Depletion o f certain
neurotransmit ters c an le ad to mo od dy sphoria, c ognitiv e problems , and other factors . This c an le ad to p eople
compulsiv ely using s timulants such as c ocaine and amphetamines , in p art to tr y to rees tablish the p erson 's
physical and ps ychologic al pre -use b aseline . (Jayanthi & Ramamo orthy, 2005; R othman , Blough , & Ba umann ,
2007).
Caffeine is another s timulant dr ug. While it is prob ably the mos t commonly use d dr ug in the w orld , the
potency o f this p articular dr ug p ales in c omp arison to the other s timulant dr ugs describ ed in this section .
Generally , people use c affeine to maintain incre ased lev els o f aler tnes s and arousal . Caffeine is f ound in man y
common me dicines (such as w eight los s dr ugs), b everages, foods, and ev en c osmetics (Herman & Herman ,
2013). While c affeine ma y ha ve some indirect eff ects on dop amine neurotransmis sion , its primar y
mechanism o f action in volves anta gonizing adenosine activity (P orkka-Heiskanen , 2011). A denosine is a130 4 • S tates o f Consciousnes s

neurotransmit ter tha t promotes sleep . Caffeine is an adenosine anta gonis t, so c affeine inhibits the adenosine
receptors , thus decre asing sleepines s and promoting w akefulnes s.
While caffeine is generally c onsidere d a rela tively sa fe dr ug, high blo od lev els o f caffeine c an result in
insomnia, a gita tion , muscle twitching , nausea, irregular he artbeat, and ev en de ath (R eissig, Strain , & Griffiths ,
2009; W olt, Ganetsky , & Ba bu, 2012). In 2012, K romann and Nielson rep orted on a c ase s tudy o f a 40- year-old
woman who suff ered signific ant ill eff ects from her use o f caffeine . The w oman use d caffeine in the p ast to
boost her mo od and to pro vide energ y, but o ver the c ourse o f sev eral y ears, she incre ased her c affeine

prev alenc e of caffeine use and the larg e numb er o f people who c onfess to suff ering from c affeine addiction ,
this w as the firs t publishe d description o f soda dep endenc e app earing in scientific litera ture .
Nicotine is highly addictiv e, and the use o f tob acco pro ducts is as sociated with incre ased risks o f he art dise ase,
strok e, and a v ariety o f cancers. Nic otine e xerts its eff ects through its interaction with ac etylcholine rec eptors .
Acetylcholine functions as a neurotransmit ter in motor neurons . In the c entral ner vous s ystem , it pla ys a role
in arousal and rew ard mechanisms . Nic otine is mos t commonly use d in the f orm o f tob acco pro ducts lik e
cigaret tes or chewing tob acco; theref ore, there is a tremendous interes t in dev eloping eff ectiv e smoking
cessation techniques . To da te, people ha ve use d a v ariety o fnicotine replac ement therapies in addition to
various ps ychotherap eutic options in an a ttempt to disc ontinue their use o f tob acco pro ducts . In g eneral ,
smoking c essation programs ma y be eff ectiv e in the shor t term , but it is uncle ar whether these eff ects p ersis t
(Crople y, The adom , Pravettoni , & W ebb, 2008; Levit t, Sha w, Wong , & K aczorowski, 2007; Sme dslund , Fisher ,
Boles , & Lichtens tein , 2004). V aping as a me ans to deliv er nic otine is b ecoming incre asingly p opular ,
especially among teens and y oung adults . Vaping uses b attery-powered devic es, sometimes c alled e-cig aret tes,
that deliv er liquid nic otine and fla vorings as a v apor. Originally rep orted as a sa fe alterna tive to the kno wn
cancer-causing a gents f ound in cig aret tes, vaping is no w kno wn to b e very dang erous and has le d to serious
lung dise ase and de ath in users (Shmerling , 2019).
Opioids
Anopioid is one o f a c ategory of drugs tha t includes heroin , morphine , methadone , and c odeine . Opioids ha ve
analg esic prop erties; tha t is, the y decre ase p ain. Humans ha ve an endog enous opioid neurotransmit ter
system—the b ody mak es small quantities o f opioid c omp ounds tha t bind to opioid rec eptors re ducing p ain and
producing euphoria. Thus , opioid dr ugs, which mimic this endog enous p ainkilling mechanism , have an
extremely high p otential f or a buse . Natural opioids , calledopiates , are deriv atives o f opium , which is a
naturally o ccurring c omp ound f ound in the p opp y plant . There are no w sev eral s ynthetic v ersions o f opia te
drugs (c orrectly c alled opioids) tha t ha ve very potent p ainkilling eff ects , and the y are o ften a buse d. For
example , the N ational Ins titutes o f Dr ug Abuse has sp onsore d rese arch tha t sugg ests the misuse and a buse o f
the prescription p ain killers h ydrocodone and o xycodone are signific ant public he alth c oncerns (Maxw ell,
2006). In 2013, the U .S. F ood and Dr ug A dminis tration rec ommende d tighter c ontrols on their me dical use .
Historic ally, heroin has b een a major opioid dr ug o f abuse ( Figure 4.17 ). Heroin c an b e snor ted, smok ed, or
injecte d intra venously . Heroin pro duces intense f eelings o f euphoria and ple asure , which are amplifie d when
the heroin is injecte d intra venously . Following the initial "r ush ," users e xperienc e 4–6 hours o f "going on the
nod," alterna ting b etween c onscious and semic onscious s tates. Heroin users o ften sho ot the dr ug directly into
their v eins . Some p eople who ha ve injecte d man y times into their arms will sho w "track marks ," while other
users will inject into are as b etween their fing ers or b etween their to es, so as not to sho w ob vious track marks
and , like all a busers o f intra venous dr ugs, have an incre ased risk f or c ontraction o f both tub erculosis and HIV .4.5 • Subs tanc e Use and Abuse 131

Aside from their utility as analg esic dr ugs, opioid-lik e comp ounds are o ften f ound in c ough suppres sants , anti-
nausea, and anti-diarrhe a me dications . Giv en tha t withdra wal from a dr ug o ften in volves an e xperienc e
opp osite to the eff ect o f the dr ug, it should b e no surprise tha t opioid withdra wal resembles a sev ere c ase o f the
flu. While opioid withdra wal can b e extremely unple asant , it is not lif e-thre atening (J ulien , 2005). Still , people
experiencing opioid withdra wal ma y be giv en methadone to mak e withdra wal from the dr ug les s difficult .
Methadone is a s ynthetic opioid tha t is les s euphorig enic than heroin and similar dr ugs.Methadone clinics
help p eople who previously s truggle d with opioid addiction mana ge withdra wal symptoms through the use o f
methadone . Other dr ugs, including the opioid buprenorphine , have also b een use d to allevia te symptoms o f
opia te withdra wal.
Codeine is an opioid with rela tively lo w potency . It is o ften prescrib ed for minor p ain, and it is a vailable o ver-
the-counter in some other c ountries . Lik e all opioids , codeine do es ha ve abuse p otential . In fact , abuse o f
prescription opioid me dications is b ecoming a major c oncern w orldwide (A quina, Marques -Baptis ta,
Bridg eman , & Merlin , 2009; C asati, Sedefov, & Pf eiffer-Gerschel , 2012).
The Opioid Crisis
Few people in the Unit ed Stat es remain unt ouched b y the r ecent opioid epidemic. It seems lik e everyone kno ws
a friend, famil y member , or neighbor who has died o f an o verdose . Opioid addiction r eached crisis le vels in the
Unit ed Stat es such that b y 2019, an a verage of 130 people died each da yof an opioid o verdose (NID A, 2019).
The crisis actual ly beg an in the 1990s , when pharmac eutical c ompanies beg an mas s-mark eting pain-r elieving
opioid drugs lik e OxyContin with the pr omise (no w kno wn t o be false) that the y were non-addictiv e. Incr eased
prescrip tions led t o greater rates o f misuse , along with gr eater incidenc e of addiction, e ven among patients who
used these drugs as pr escribed. Ph ysiological ly, the body can bec ome addict ed to opiat e drugs in les s than a
week, including when tak en as pr escribed. Withdr awal from opioids includes pain, which patients o ften
misint erpr et as pain caused b y the pr oblem that led t o the original pr escrip tion, and which motiv ates patients t o
continue using the drugs .
The FD A's 2013 r ecommendation f or tight er contr ols on opiat e prescrip tions left man y patients addict ed to
prescrip tion drugs lik e OxyContin unable t o ob tain legitimat e prescrip tions . This cr eated a black mark et for the
drug , wher e pric es soar ed to $80 or mor e for a single pil l. To prevent withdr awal, man y people turned t o cheaper
heroin, which c ould be bought f or $5 a dose or les s. To keep her oin aff ordable , man y dealers beg an adding mor e
potent s ynthetic opioids including f entan yl and car fentan yl to incr ease the eff ects o f her oin. These s ynthetic
drugs ar e so pot ent that e ven smal l doses can cause o verdose and death.
Large-scale public heal th campaigns b y the National Ins titut es o f Heal th and the National Ins titut e of Drug Abuse

Historic ally, hypnosis has b een view ed with some suspicion b ecause o f its p ortrayal in p opular me dia and
enter tainment ( Figure 4.20 ). Theref ore, it is imp ortant to mak e a dis tinction b etween h ypnosis as an
empiric ally b ased therap eutic appro ach v ersus as a f orm o f enter tainment . Contrar y to p opular b elief,
individuals underg oing h ypnosis usually ha ve cle ar memories o f the h ypnotic e xperienc e and are in c ontrol o f
their o wn b ehaviors . While h ypnosis ma y be useful in enhancing memor y or a skill , such enhanc ements are
very mo dest in na ture (Raz, 2011).134 4 • S tates o f Consciousnes s

FIGURE 4.20 Popular por trayals o f hypnosis ha ve led t o some widel y-held misc onceptions .
How exactly do es a h ypnotis t bring a p articip ant to a s tate of hypnosis? While there are v aria tions , there are
four p arts tha t app ear consis tent in bringing p eople into the s tate of sugg estibility as sociated with h ypnosis
(National R esearch C ouncil , 1994). These c omp onents include:
•The p articip ant is guide d to f ocus on one thing , such as the h ypnotis t’s words or a ticking w atch.
•The p articip ant is made c omf ortable and is directe d to b e relax ed and sleep y.
•The p articip ant is told to b e op en to the pro cess of hypnosis , trust the h ypnotis t and let g o.
•The p articip ant is enc oura ged to use their ima gina tion .
These s teps are c onduciv e to b eing op en to the heightene d sugg estibility o f hypnosis .
People v ary in terms o f their a bility to b e hypnotiz ed, but a review o f available rese arch sugg ests tha t mos t
people are a t least mo dera tely h ypnotiza ble (Kihls trom , 2013). Hypnosis in c onjunction with other techniques
is use d for a v ariety o f therap eutic purp oses and has sho wn to b e at least somewha t eff ectiv e for p ain
mana gement , tre atment o f depres sion and anxiety , smoking c essation , and w eight los s (Alladin , 2012; Elkins ,
Johnson , & F isher , 2012; Golden , 2012; Mont gomer y, Schnur , & K ravits, 2012).
How do es h ypnosis w ork? Tw o theories a ttempt to ans wer this ques tion: One theor y view s hypnosis as
dissociation and the other theor y view s it as the p erformanc e of a so cial role . According to the dis sociation
view , hypnosis is eff ectiv ely a dis sociated state of consciousnes s, much lik e our e arlier e xample where y ou ma y
driv e to w ork, but y ou are only minimally a ware o f the pro cess of driving b ecause y our a ttention is f ocuse d
elsewhere . This theor y is supp orted by Ernes t Hilg ard’s rese arch into h ypnosis and p ain. In Hilg ard’s
experiments , he induc ed particip ants into a s tate of hypnosis , and plac ed their arms into ic e water.
Particip ants w ere told the y would not f eel p ain, but the y could pres s a but ton if the y did; while the y rep orted
not f eeling p ain, the y did , in fact , pres s the but ton, sugg esting a dis sociation o f consciousnes s while in the
hypnotic s tate (Hilg ard & Hilg ard, 1994).
Taking a diff erent appro ach to e xplain h ypnosis , the so cial-c ognitiv e theor y of hypnosis sees p eople in
hypnotic s tates as p erforming the so cial role o f a h ypnotiz ed person . As y ou will le arn when y ou s tudy so cial
roles , people ’s behavior c an b e shap ed by their e xpecta tions o f ho w the y should act in a giv en situa tion . Some
view a h ypnotiz ed person ’s behavior not as an altere d or dis sociated state of consciousnes s, but as their
fulfillment o f the so cial e xpecta tions f or tha t role (C oe, 2009; C oe & Sarbin , 1966).4.6 • Other S tates o f Consciousnes s135
Meditation
Meditat ion is the act o f focusing on a single targ et (such as the bre ath or a rep eated sound) to incre ase
awarenes s of the moment . While h ypnosis is g enerally achiev ed through the interaction o f a therapis t and the
person b eing tre ated, an individual c an p erform me dita tion alone . Often , however, people wishing to le arn to
medita te rec eive some training in techniques to achiev e a me dita tive state.
Although there are a numb er o f diff erent techniques in use , the c entral f eature o f all me dita tion is cle aring the
mind in order to achiev e a s tate of relax ed awarenes s and f ocus (Chen et al ., 2013; Lang et al ., 2012).
Mindfulnes s me dita tion has rec ently b ecome p opular . In the v aria tion o f mindful me dita tion , the me dita tor’s
attention is f ocuse d on some internal pro cess or an e xternal object (Z eidan , Grant , Bro wn, McHa ffie, & C oghill ,
2012).
Medita tive techniques ha ve their ro ots in religious practic es (Figure 4.21 ), but their use has gro wn in
popularity among practitioners o f alterna tive me dicine . Research indic ates tha t me dita tion ma y help re duce
blood pres sure , and the Americ an He art As sociation sugg ests tha t me dita tion might b e use d in c onjunction
with more traditional tre atments as a w ay to mana ge hypertension , although there is not sufficient da ta for a
recommenda tion to b e made (Bro ok et al ., 2013). Lik e hypnosis , me dita tion also sho ws promise in s tres s
mana gement , sleep quality (C aldw ell, Harrison , Adams , Quin , & Greeson , 2010), tre atment o f mo od and
anxiety disorders (Chen et al ., 2013; F reeman et al ., 2010; V ølles tad, Nielsen , & Nielsen , 2012), and p ain
mana gement (R einer , Tibi , & Lipsitz, 2013).

Summary
4.1 What Is Consciousness?
States o f consciousnes s vary over the c ourse o f the da y and throughout our liv es. Imp ortant factors in these
chang es are the biologic al rh ythms , and , more sp ecific ally, the circ adian rh ythms g enera ted by the
suprachiasma tic nucleus (SCN). T ypic ally, our biologic al clo cks are aligne d with our e xternal en vironment ,
and light tends to b e an imp ortant cue in set ting this clo ck. When p eople tra vel acros s multiple time z ones or
work rota ting shifts , the y can e xperienc e disr uptions o f their circ adian cy cles tha t can le ad to insomnia,
sleepines s, and decre ased aler tnes s. Bright light therap y has sho wn to b e promising in de aling with circ adian
disr uptions . If p eople g o extende d perio ds o f time without sleep , the y will ac crue a sleep debt and p otentially
experienc e a numb er o f adv erse ps ychologic al and ph ysiologic al conse quenc es.
4.2 Sleep and Why W e Sleep
We dev ote a v ery larg e portion o f time to sleep , and our brains ha ve comple x systems tha t control v arious
aspects o f sleep . Sev eral hormones imp ortant f or ph ysical gro wth and ma tura tion are secrete d during sleep .
While the re ason w e sleep remains something o f a m ystery, there is some evidenc e to sugg est tha t sleep is v ery
imp ortant to le arning and memor y.
4.3 Stages of Sleep
The diff erent s tages o f sleep are characteriz ed by the p atterns o f brain w aves as sociated with e ach s tage. As a
person transitions from b eing a wake to falling asleep , alpha w aves are replac ed by theta w aves. Sleep spindles
and K -comple xes emerg e in s tage 2 sleep . Sta ge 3 and s tage 4 are describ ed as slo w-w ave sleep tha t is mark ed
by a pre dominanc e of delta w aves. REM sleep in volves rapid mo vements o f the e yes, paraly sis o f voluntar y
muscles , and dre aming . Both NREM and REM sleep app ear to pla y imp ortant roles in le arning and memor y.
Dreams ma y represent lif e ev ents tha t are imp ortant to the dre amer . Alterna tively, dre aming ma y represent a
state of proto consciousnes s, or a vir tual re ality , in the mind tha t helps a p erson during c onsciousnes s.
4.4 Sleep Pr oblems and Disor ders
Man y individuals suff er from some typ e of sleep disorder or dis turb ance at some p oint in their liv es. Insomnia
is a c ommon e xperienc e in which p eople ha ve difficulty falling or s taying asleep . Parasomnias in volve
unwante d motor b ehavior or e xperienc es throughout the sleep cy cle and include RBD , sleep walking , res tless
leg s yndrome , and night terrors . Sleep apne a occurs when individuals s top bre athing during their sleep , and in
the c ase o f sudden infant de ath syndrome , infants will s top bre athing during sleep and die . Narcoleps y
involves an irresis tible urg e to fall asleep during w aking hours and is o ften as sociated with c ataple xy and
hallucina tion .
4.5 Substance Use and Abuse
Subs tanc e use disorder is define d in DSM-5 as a c ompulsiv e pattern o f drug use despite neg ative
conse quenc es. Both ph ysical and ps ychologic al dep endenc e are imp ortant p arts of this disorder . Alcohol ,
barbitura tes, and b enzodiaz epines are c entral ner vous s ystem depres sants tha t affect G ABA
neurotransmis sion . Cocaine , amphetamine , cathinones , and MDMA are all c entral ner vous s timulants tha t
agoniz e dop amine neurotransmis sion , while nic otine and c affeine a ffect ac etylcholine and adenosine ,
resp ectiv ely. Opia te dr ugs ser ve as p owerful analg esics through their eff ects on the endog enous opioid
neurotransmit ter s ystem , and hallucinog enic dr ugs c ause pronounc ed chang es in sensor y and p erceptual
experienc es. The hallucinog ens are v aria ble with reg ards to the sp ecific neurotransmit ter s ystems the y affect.
4.6 Other States of Consciousness
Hypnosis is a f ocus on the self tha t involves sugg ested chang es o f behavior and e xperienc e. Me dita tion
involves relax ed, yet focuse d, awarenes s. Both h ypnotic and me dita tive states ma y involve altere d states o f

We rely on our sensor y systems to pro vide imp ortant inf orma tion a bout our surroundings . We use this

5.1 Sensation versus P erception
LEARNING OBJEC TIVES
By the end o f this section, y ou wil l be able t o:
•Distinguish betw een sensation and per ception
•Describe the c oncepts of absolut e thr eshold and diff erence thr eshold
•Discus s the r oles at tention, motiv ation, and sensor y adap tation pla y in per ception
Sensation
Wha t do es it me an to sense something? Sensor y rec eptors are sp ecializ ed neurons tha t resp ond to sp ecific
types o f stimuli . When sensor y inf orma tion is detecte d by a sensor y rec eptor ,sensat ion has o ccurre d. For
example , light tha t enters the e ye causes chemic al chang es in c ells tha t line the b ack o f the e ye. These c ells
rela y mes sages, in the f orm o f action p otentials (as y ou le arne d when s tudying biops ycholog y), to the c entral
nervous s ystem . The c onversion from sensor y stimulus energ y to action p otential is kno wn as transduct ion.
You ha ve prob ably kno wn sinc e elementar y scho ol tha t we ha ve fiv e senses: vision , hearing (a udition), smell
(olfaction), tas te (gustation), and touch (soma tosensa tion). It turns out tha t this notion o f five senses is
oversimplifie d. We also ha ve sensor y systems tha t pro vide inf orma tion a bout b alanc e (the v estibular sense),
body p osition and mo vement (proprio ception and kines thesia), p ain (no ciception), and temp erature
(thermo ception).
The sensitivity o f a giv en sensor y system to the relev ant s timuli c an b e expres sed as an a bsolute threshold .
Absolute threshold refers to the minimum amount o f stimulus energ y tha t mus t be present f or the s timulus to
be detecte d 50% o f the time . Another w ay to think a bout this is b y asking ho w dim c an a light b e or ho w so ft
can a sound b e and s till b e detecte d half o f the time . The sensitivity o f our sensor y rec eptors c an b e quite
amazing . It has b een es tima ted tha t on a cle ar night , the mos t sensitiv e sensor y cells in the b ack o f the e ye can
detect a c andle flame 30 miles a way (Oka wa & Samp ath, 2007). Under quiet c onditions , the hair c ells (the
receptor c ells o f the inner e ar) c an detect the tick o f a clo ck 20 f eet a way (G alanter , 1962).
It is also p ossible f or us to g et mes sages tha t are presente d below the threshold f or c onscious a warenes s—these
are c alledsubliminal mes sages. A s timulus re aches a ph ysiologic al threshold when it is s trong enough to
excite sensor y rec eptors and send ner ve impulses to the brain: This is an a bsolute threshold . A mes sage below
that threshold is said to b e subliminal: W e rec eive it, but w e are not c onsciously a ware o f it. Over the y ears
there has b een a gre at deal of specula tion a bout the use o f subliminal mes sages in adv ertising , rock music , and
self-help a udio programs . Research evidenc e sho ws tha t in la boratory set tings , people c an pro cess and
resp ond to inf orma tion outside o f awarenes s. But this do es not me an tha t we ob ey these mes sages lik e
zombies; in fact , hidden mes sages ha ve little eff ect on b ehavior outside the la boratory (K unst-Wilson & Zajonc ,
1980; R ensink , 2004; N elson , 2008; Radel , Sarrazin , Legrain , & Gob ancé, 2009; Lo ersch , Durso , & P etty, 2013).
Absolute thresholds are g enerally me asure d under incre dibly c ontrolle d conditions in situa tions tha t are
optimal f or sensitivity . Sometimes , we are more interes ted in ho w much diff erenc e in s timuli is re quire d to
detect a diff erenc e between them . This is kno wn as the just not iceable diff erenc e (jnd) ordifferenc e
threshold . Unlik e the a bsolute threshold , the diff erenc e threshold chang es dep ending on the s timulus
intensity . As an e xample , ima gine y ourself in a v ery dark mo vie the ater. If an a udienc e memb er w ere to rec eive
a text mes sage tha t caused the c ell phone screen to light up , chanc es are tha t man y people w ould notic e the
chang e in illumina tion in the the ater. Ho wever, if the same thing happ ened in a brightly lit arena during a
basketball g ame , very few p eople w ould notic e. The c ell phone brightnes s do es not chang e, but its a bility to b e
detecte d as a chang e in illumina tion v aries drama tically b etween the tw o conte xts. Erns t Weber prop osed this
theor y of chang e in diff erenc e threshold in the 1830s , and it has b ecome kno wn as W eber’s law: The diff erenc e
threshold is a c onstant fraction o f the original s timulus , as the e xample illus trates.146 5 • Sensa tion and P erception

Perception
While our sensor y rec eptors are c onstantly c ollecting inf orma tion from the en vironment , it is ultima tely ho w
we interpret tha t inf orma tion tha t affects ho w w e interact with the w orld .Perception refers to the w ay sensor y
informa tion is org aniz ed, interprete d, and c onsciously e xperienc ed. Perception in volves b oth b ottom-up and
top-down pro cessing .Bottom-up pro cessing refers to sensor y inf orma tion from a s timulus in the
environment driving a pro cess, and top-down pro cessing refers to kno wledge and e xpectancy driving a
process, as sho wn in Figure 5.2 (Egeth & Y antis , 1997; F ine & Minner y, 2009; Y antis & E geth, 1999).
FIGURE 5.2 Top-down and bot tom-up ar e ways we process our per ceptions .
Ima gine tha t you and some friends are sit ting in a cro wded res taurant e ating lunch and talking . It is v ery nois y,
and y ou are c oncentra ting on y our friend ’s fac e to he ar wha t the y are sa ying , then the sound o f bre aking glas s
and clang o f metal p ans hit ting the flo or rings out . The ser ver dropp ed a larg e tra y of food. Although y ou w ere
attending to y our me al and c onversa tion , tha t crashing sound w ould lik ely g et through y our a ttentional filters
and c apture y our a ttention . You w ould ha ve no choic e but to notic e it. Tha t attentional c apture w ould b e caused
by the sound from the en vironment: it w ould b e bottom-up .
Alterna tively, top -down pro cesses are g enerally g oal directe d, slo w, delib erate, effortful, and under y our
control (F ine & Minner y, 2009; Miller & C ohen , 2001; Miller & D 'Esp osito , 2005). F or ins tanc e, if y ou misplac ed
your k eys, how w ould y ou lo ok for them? If y ou had a y ellow key fob, you w ould prob ably lo ok for y ellownes s of
a certain siz e in sp ecific lo cations , such as on the c ounter , coffee ta ble, and other similar plac es. You w ould not
look for y ellownes s on y our c eiling fan , because y ou kno w keys are not normally lying on top o f a c eiling fan .
Tha t act o f searching f or a c ertain siz e of yellownes s in some lo cations and not others w ould b e top -
down—under y our c ontrol and b ased on y our e xperienc e.
One w ay to think o f this c oncept is tha t sensa tion is a ph ysical pro cess, where as p erception is ps ychologic al.
For e xample , up on w alking into a kitchen and smelling the sc ent o f baking cinnamon rolls , the sensa tion is the
scent rec eptors detecting the o dor o f cinnamon , but the perception may be “Mmm , this smells lik e the bre ad
Grandma use d to b ake when the family g athere d for holida ys.”
Although our p erceptions are built from sensa tions , not all sensa tions result in p erception . In fact , we often
don ’t perceive stimuli tha t remain rela tively c onstant o ver prolong ed perio ds o f time . This is kno wn as
sensor y adaptat ion. Ima gine g oing to a city tha t you ha ve nev er visite d. You check in to the hotel , but when
you g et to y our ro om, there is a ro ad c onstruction sign with a bright flashing light outside y our windo w.
Unfortuna tely, there are no other ro oms a vailable, so y ou are s tuck with a flashing light . You decide to w atch
television to un wind . The flashing light w as e xtremely anno ying when y ou firs t entere d your ro om. It w as as if
someone w as c ontinually turning a bright y ellow sp otlight on and o ff in y our ro om, but a fter w atching
television f or a shor t while , you no long er notic e the light flashing . The light is s till flashing and filling y our
room with y ellow light ev ery few sec onds , and the photorec eptors in y our e yes still sense the light , but y ou no
long er p erceive the rapid chang es in lighting c onditions . Tha t you no long er p erceive the flashing light
demons trates sensor y adapta tion and sho ws tha t while closely as sociated, sensa tion and p erception are
different .5.1 • Sensa tion v ersus P erception 147
There is another factor tha t affects sensa tion and p erception: a ttention . Attention pla ys a signific ant role in
determining wha t is sense d versus wha t is p erceived. Ima gine y ou are a t a p arty full o f music , cha tter, and
laughter . You g et in volved in an interes ting c onversa tion with a friend , and y ou tune out all the b ackground
noise . If someone interr upte d you to ask wha t song had jus t finishe d pla ying , you w ould prob ably b e una ble to
answer tha t ques tion .
LINK T O LEARNING
See f or y ourself ho w ina ttentional blindnes s works b y checking out this selectiv e attention tes t
(http://openstax.org/l/blindnes s)from Simons and Cha bris (1999).
One o f the mos t interes ting demons trations o f ho w imp ortant a ttention is in determining our p erception o f the
environment o ccurre d in a famous s tudy c onducte d by Daniel Simons and Chris topher Cha bris (1999). In this
study , particip ants w atche d a video o f people dres sed in black and white p assing b asketballs. Particip ants
were ask ed to c ount the numb er o f times the te am dres sed in white p assed the b all. During the video , a p erson
dres sed in a black g orilla c ostume w alks among the tw o teams . You w ould think tha t someone w ould notic e the
gorilla, right? N early half o f the p eople who w atche d the video didn ’t notic e the g orilla a t all , despite the fact
that he w as cle arly visible f or nine sec onds . Bec ause p articip ants w ere so f ocuse d on the numb er o f times the
team dres sed in white w as p assing the b all, the y completely tune d out other visual inf orma tion .Inattent ional
blindnes sis the failure to notic e something tha t is c ompletely visible b ecause the p erson w as activ ely
attending to something else and did not p ay attention to other things (Mack & R ock, 1998; Simons & Cha bris ,
1999).
In a similar e xperiment , rese archers tes ted ina ttentional blindnes s by asking p articip ants to obser ve ima ges
moving acros s a c omputer screen . The y were ins tructe d to f ocus on either white or black objects , disreg arding
the other c olor . When a re d cros s passed acros s the screen , about one third o f subjects did not notic e it ( Figure
5.3) (Mos t, Simons , Scholl , & Cha bris , 2000).
FIGURE 5.3 Nearl y one thir d of par ticipants in a s tudy did not notic e that a r ed cr oss pas sed on the scr een because
their at tention w as focused on the black or whit e fig ures. (credit: Cor y Zank er)
Motiv ation c an also a ffect p erception . Ha ve you ev er b een e xpecting a re ally imp ortant phone c all and , while
taking a sho wer, you think y ou he ar the phone ringing , only to disc over tha t it is not? If so , then y ou ha ve
experienc ed ho w motiv ation to detect a me aningful s timulus c an shift our a bility to discrimina te between a
true sensor y stimulus and b ackground noise . The a bility to identif y a s timulus when it is emb edde d in a
distracting b ackground is c alledsignal detect ion theor y. This might also e xplain wh y a mother is a wakened
by a quiet murmur from her b aby but not b y other sounds tha t occur while she is asleep . Signal detection
theor y has practic al applic ations , such as incre asing air tra ffic c ontroller ac curacy . Controllers nee d to b e able
to detect planes among man y signals ( blips) tha t app ear on the radar screen and f ollow those planes as the y
move through the sky . In fact , the original w ork o f the rese archer who dev elop ed signal detection theor y was
focuse d on impro ving the sensitivity o f air tra ffic c ontrollers to plane blips (Sw ets, 1964).

Our p erceptions c an also b e affecte d by our b eliefs , values , prejudic es, expecta tions , and lif e experienc es. As
you will see la ter in this chapter , individuals who are depriv ed of the e xperienc e of bino cular vision during
critic al perio ds o f dev elopment ha ve trouble p erceiving depth (F awcett, Wang , & Birch , 2005). The share d
experienc es o f people within a giv en cultural c onte xt can ha ve pronounc ed eff ects on p erception . For e xample ,
Marshall Seg all, Donald C ampb ell, and Melville Hersk ovits (1963) publishe d the results o f a multina tional
study in which the y demons trated tha t individuals from W estern cultures were more prone to e xperienc e
certain typ es o f visual illusions than individuals from non-W estern cultures , and vic e versa. One such illusion
that Westerners w ere more lik ely to e xperienc e was the Müller -Lyerillusion ( Figure 5.4 ): The lines app ear to b e
different lengths , but the y are actually the same length .
FIGURE 5.4 In the Mül ler-Lyer illusion, lines appear t o be diff erent lengths al though the y are identical . (a) Arr ows at
the ends o f lines ma y mak e the line on the right appear long er, although the lines ar e the same length. (b) When
applied t o a thr ee-dimensional imag e, the line on the right ag ain ma y appear long er al though both black lines ar e
the same length.
These p erceptual diff erenc es w ere c onsis tent with diff erenc es in the typ es o f environmental f eatures
experienc ed on a regular b asis b y people in a giv en cultural c onte xt. People in W estern cultures , for e xample ,
have a p erceptual c onte xt of buildings with s traight lines , wha t Seg all’s study c alled a c arpentere d world (Seg all
et al ., 1966). In c ontras t, people from c ertain non-W estern cultures with an unc arpentere d view , such as the
Zulu o f South Afric a, whose villa ges are made up o f round huts arrang ed in circles , are les s susc eptible to this
illusion (Seg all et al ., 1999). It is not jus t vision tha t is a ffecte d by cultural factors . Indee d, rese arch has
demons trated tha t the a bility to identif y an o dor, and ra te its ple asantnes s and its intensity , varies cros s-
culturally (A yabe-Kanamura, Saito , Dis tel, Mar tíne z-Góme z, & Hudson , 1998).
Children describ ed as thrill seek ers are more lik ely to sho w tas te pref erenc es for intense sour fla vors (Liem ,
Westerb eek, Wolterink , Kok, & de Graa f, 2004), which sugg ests tha t basic asp ects o f personality might a ffect
perception . Furthermore , individuals who hold p ositiv e attitudes to ward re duced-fa t foods are more lik ely to
rate foods la beled as re duced fat as tas ting b etter than p eople who ha ve les s positiv e attitudes a bout these
products (Aaron , Mela, & E vans, 1994).

terms o f comp osition , wave forms share similar characteris tics tha t are esp ecially imp ortant to our visual and5.2 • W aves and W avelengths 149
auditor y perceptions . In this section , we describ e the ph ysical prop erties o f the w aves as w ell as the p erceptual
experienc es as sociated with them .
Amplitude and W avelength
Two ph ysical characteris tics o f a w ave are amplitude and w avelength ( Figure 5.5 ). The amplitude of a w ave is
the dis tanc e from the c enter line to the top p oint o f the cres t or the b ottom p oint o f the trough .Wavelength
refers to the length o f a w ave from one p eak to the ne xt.
FIGURE 5.5 The amplitude or height o f a w ave is measur ed fr om the peak t o the tr ough. The w avelength is
measur ed fr om peak t o peak.
Wavelength is directly rela ted to the fre quency o f a giv en w ave form .Frequency refers to the numb er o f waves
that pass a giv en p oint in a giv en time p erio d and is o ften e xpres sed in terms o fhertz (Hz) , or cy cles p er
second . Long er w avelengths will ha ve lower fre quencies , and shor ter w avelengths will ha ve higher fre quencies
(Figure 5.6 ).
FIGURE 5.6 This fig ure illustrates w aves o f diff ering w avelengths/fr equencies . At the t op o f the fig ure, the r ed w ave
has a long w avelength/shor t frequency . Mo ving fr om t op to bot tom, the w avelengths decr ease and fr equencies
increase .
Light W aves
The visible sp ectr um is the p ortion o f the larg erelectroma gnet ic sp ectr um that we can see . As Figure 5.7
shows, the electroma gnetic sp ectr um enc omp asses all o f the electroma gnetic radia tion tha t occurs in our
environment and includes g amma ra ys, x-rays, ultra violet light , visible light , infrare d light , micro waves, and
radio w aves. The visible sp ectr um in humans is as sociated with w avelengths tha t rang e from 380 to 740 nm—a
very small dis tanc e, sinc e a nanometer (nm) is one billionth o f a meter . Other sp ecies c an detect other p ortions
of the electroma gnetic sp ectr um. For ins tanc e, hone ybees c an see light in the ultra violet rang e (Wakak uwa,
Stavenga, & Arika wa, 2007), and some snak es c an detect infrare d radia tion in addition to more traditional
visual light cues (Chen , Deng , Bra uth, Ding , & T ang , 2012; Har tline , Kass, & Lo op, 1978).150 5 • Sensa tion and P erception

FIGURE 5.7 Light that is visible t o humans mak es up onl y a smal l por tion o f the electr omagnetic spectrum.
In humans , light w avelength is as sociated with p erception o f color ( Figure 5.8 ). W ithin the visible sp ectr um,
our e xperienc e of red is as sociated with long er w avelengths , greens are interme diate, and blues and violets are
shor ter in w avelength . (An e asy way to rememb er this is the mnemonic R OYGBIV :red,orang e,yellow,green ,
blue,indig o,violet .) The amplitude o f light w aves is as sociated with our e xperienc e of brightnes s or intensity o f
color , with larg er amplitudes app earing brighter .

Sound W aves
Like light w aves, the ph ysical prop erties o f sound w aves are as sociated with v arious asp ects o f our p erception
of sound . The fre quency o f a sound w ave is as sociated with our p erception o f tha t sound ’spitch . High-
frequency sound w aves are p erceived as high-pitche d sounds , while lo w-fre quency sound w aves are p erceived
as lo w-pitche d sounds . The a udible rang e of sound fre quencies is b etween 20 and 20000 Hz, with gre atest
sensitivity to those fre quencies tha t fall in the middle o f this rang e.
As w as the c ase with the visible sp ectr um, other sp ecies sho w diff erenc es in their a udible rang es. For ins tanc e,
chick ens ha ve a v ery limite d audible rang e, from 125 to 2000 Hz. Mic e ha ve an a udible rang e from 1000 to
91000 Hz, and the b elug a whale ’s audible rang e is from 1000 to 123000 Hz. Our p et dogs and c ats ha ve audible
rang es o f about 70–45000 Hz and 45–64000 Hz, resp ectiv ely (Strain , 2003).
The loudnes s of a giv en sound is closely as sociated with the amplitude o f the sound w ave. Higher amplitudes
are as sociated with louder sounds . Loudnes s is me asure d in terms o fdecib els (dB) , a log arithmic unit o f
sound intensity . A typic al conversa tion w ould c orrela te with 60 dB; a ro ck c oncert might check in a t 120 dB
(Figure 5.9 ). A whisp er 5 f eet a way or r ustling le aves are a t the lo w end o f our he aring rang e; sounds lik e a
windo w air c onditioner , a normal c onversa tion , and ev en he avy tra ffic or a v acuum cle aner are within a
tolera ble rang e. Ho wever, there is the p otential f or he aring dama ge from a bout 80 dB to 130 dB: These are
sounds o f a food pro cessor, power la wnmo wer, heavy truck (25 f eet a way), sub way train (20 f eet a way), liv e5.2 • W aves and W avelengths 151
rock music , and a jackhammer . Ab out one -third o f all he aring los s is due to noise e xposure , and the louder the
sound , the shor ter the e xposure nee ded to c ause he aring dama ge (Le , Straa tman , Lea, & W esterb erg, 2017).
Listening to music through e arbuds a t maximum v olume (around 100–105 decib els) c an c ause noise -induc ed
hearing los s after 15 minutes o f exposure . Although lis tening to music a t maximum v olume ma y not seem to
cause dama ge, it incre ases the risk o f age-rela ted he aring los s (Kujawa & Lib erman , 2006). The threshold f or
pain is a bout 130 dB , a jet plane taking o ff or a rev olver firing a t close rang e (Dunkle , 1982).

Although w ave amplitude is g enerally as sociated with loudnes s, there is some interaction b etween fre quency
and amplitude in our p erception o f loudnes s within the a udible rang e. For e xample , a 10 Hz sound w ave is
inaudible no ma tter the amplitude o f the w ave. A 1000 Hz sound w ave, on the other hand , would v ary
drama tically in terms o f perceived loudnes s as the amplitude o f the w ave incre ased.

Anatomy of the Visual System
The e ye is the major sensor y org an in volved in vision (Figure 5.11 ). Light w aves are transmit ted acros s the
corne a and enter the e ye through the pupil . The corne ais the transp arent c overing o ver the e ye. It ser ves as a
barrier b etween the inner e ye and the outside w orld , and it is in volved in f ocusing light w aves tha t enter the
eye. The pupil is the small op ening in the e ye through which light p asses, and the siz e of the pupil c an chang e
as a function o f light lev els as w ell as emotional arousal . When light lev els are lo w, the pupil will b ecome

become smaller , to re duce the amount o f light tha t enters the e ye. The pupil ’s siz e is c ontrolle d by muscles tha t

After p assing through the pupil , light cros ses the lens , a cur ved, transp arent s tructure tha t ser ves to pro vide
additional f ocus. The lens is a ttache d to muscles tha t can chang e its shap e to aid in f ocusing light tha t is

small indenta tion in the b ack o f the e ye kno wn as the fovea, which is p art of the retina, the light -sensitiv e
lining o f the e ye. The f ovea contains densely p acked sp ecializ ed photorec eptor c ells ( Figure 5.12 ). These
photorec eptor cells, kno wn as c ones , are light -detecting c ells. The cones are sp ecializ ed typ es o f

If your ro ds do not trans form light into ner ve impulses as e asily and efficiently as the y should , you will ha ve

Rods and c ones are c onnecte d (via sev eral interneurons) to retinal g anglion c ells. Axons from the retinal
ganglion c ells c onverge and e xit through the b ack o f the e ye to f orm the optic ner ve. The optic ner ve carries
visual inf orma tion from the retina to the brain . There is a p oint in the visual field c alled the blind sp ot: Even
when light from a small object is f ocuse d on the blind sp ot, we do not see it . We are not c onsciously a ware o f
our blind sp ots f or tw o re asons: F irst, each e ye gets a slightly diff erent view o f the visual field; theref ore, the
blind sp ots do not o verlap . Sec ond , our visual s ystem fills in the blind sp ot so tha t although w e cannot resp ond
to visual inf orma tion tha t occurs in tha t portion o f the visual field , we are also not a ware tha t inf orma tion is
mis sing .
The optic ner ve from e ach e ye merg es jus t below the brain a t a p oint c alled the optic chiasm . As Figure 5.13
shows, the optic chiasm is an X -shap ed structure tha t sits jus t below the c erebral c ortex at the front o f the
brain . At the p oint o f the optic chiasm , inf orma tion from the right visual field ( which c omes from b oth e yes) is
sent to the left side o f the brain , and inf orma tion from the left visual field is sent to the right side o f the brain .5.3 • Vision 155

Onc e inside the brain , visual inf orma tion is sent via a numb er o f structures to the o ccipital lob e at the b ack o f

The Ethics of R esear ch Using Animals
David Hubel and T orsten Wiesel w ere awarded the Nobel P rize in Medicine in 1981 f or their r esear ch on the
visual s ystem. The y collabor ated for mor e than tw enty y ears and made significant disc overies about the
neur olog y of visual per ception (Hubel & Wiesel , 1959, 1962, 1963, 1970; Wiesel & Hubel , 1963). The y studied
animals , mos tly cats and monk eys. Although the y used se veral techniques , the y did c onsider able single unit
recordings , during which tin y electr odes w ere inser ted in the animal ’s brain t o det ermine when a single c ell was
activ ated. Among their man y disc overies , the y found that specific br ain c ells respond t o lines with specific
orientations (cal led ocular dominanc e), and the y mapped the w ay those c ells ar e arr anged in ar eas o f the visual
cortex kno wn as c olumns and h yper columns .
In some o f their r esear ch, the y sutur ed one e ye of newborn kit tens closed and f ollowed the de velopment o f the
kittens' vision. The y disc overed ther e was a critical period o f development f or vision. If kit tens w ere depriv ed o f

Like vir tually every other indus trializ ed nation, the Unit ed Stat es permits medical e xperimentation on animals ,

Ther e is no ques tion that medical r esear ch is a v aluable and impor tant pr actic e. The ques tion is whether the use

Color and Depth P erception

Colorblindness: A P ersonal Story
Several years ag o, I dr essed t o go to a public function and w alked int o the kit chen wher e my 7-year-old daught er
sat. She look ed up at me , and in her mos t stern v oice, said, “ You can ’t wear that. ” I ask ed, " Why not?" and she
informed me the c olors o f my clothes did not mat ch. She had c omplained fr equentl y that I w as bad at mat ching m y
shirts, pants , and ties , but this time , she sounded especial ly alarmed. As a single father with no one else t o ask at
home , I dr ove us t o the near est convenienc e store and ask ed the s tore clerk if m y clothes mat ched. She said m y
pants w ere a bright gr een c olor, my shir t was a r eddish or ange, and m y tie w as br own. She look ed at m y quizzical ly
and said, "No w ay do y our clothes mat ch." Ov er the ne xt few da ys, I started asking m y coworkers and friends if m y
clothes mat ched. Aft er se veral da ys of being t old that m y coworkers jus t thought I had "a r eally unique s tyle," I
made an appointment with an e ye doct or and w as tested (Figure 5.15 ). It w as then that I f ound out that I w as
colorblind. I cannot diff erentiat e betw een mos t greens , browns , and r eds. Fortunat ely, other than unkno wingl y
being badl y dressed, m y colorblindnes s rarely harms m y da y-to-day life.

Some f orms o f color deficiency ar e rare. Seeing in gr ayscale (onl y shades o f black and whit e) is e xtremel y rare, and
people who do so onl y ha ve rods, which means the y ha ve very low visual acuity and cannot see v ery well. The mos t
common X -link ed inherit ed abnormality is r ed-gr een c olor blindnes s (Bir ch, 2012). Appr oximat ely 8% o f males with
European Caucasian dec ent, 5% o f Asian males , 4% o f African males , and les s than 2% o f indig enous American

about 0.4% in f emales fr om Eur opean Caucasian desc ent ha ve red-gr een c olor deficiency (Bir ch, 2012).
The trichroma tic theor y of color vision is not the only theor y—another major theor y of color vision is kno wn as
the opp onent -pro cess theor y. According to this theor y, color is c oded in opp onent p airs: black -white , yellow-
blue , and green-re d. The b asic ide a is tha t some c ells o f the visual s ystem are e xcited by one o f the opp onent
colors and inhibite d by the other . So, a c ell tha t was e xcited by wavelengths as sociated with green w ould b e
inhibite d by wavelengths as sociated with re d, and vic e versa. One o f the implic ations o f opp onent pro cessing is
that we do not e xperienc e greenish-re ds or y ellowish-blues as c olors . Another implic ation is tha t this le ads to
the e xperienc e of neg ative afterima ges. An afterima gedescrib es the c ontinua tion o f a visual sensa tion a fter
remo val of the s timulus . For e xample , when y ou s tare briefly a t the sun and then lo ok a way from it , you ma y
still p erceive a sp ot of light although the s timulus (the sun) has b een remo ved. When c olor is in volved in the
stimulus , the c olor p airings identifie d in the opp onent -pro cess theor y lead to a neg ative afterima ge. You c an
test this c oncept using the fla g in Figure 5.16 .

What do y ou see? This is kno wn as a neg ative aft erimag e, and it pr ovides empirical suppor t for the opponent -

But these tw o theories —the trichroma tic theor y of color vision and the opp onent -pro cess theor y—are not
mutually e xclusiv e. Research has sho wn tha t the y jus t apply to diff erent lev els o f the ner vous s ystem . For
visual pro cessing on the retina, trichroma tic theor y applies: the c ones are resp onsiv e to three diff erent
wavelengths tha t represent re d, blue , and green . But onc e the signal mo ves p ast the retina on its w ay to the

Depth P erception
Our a bility to p erceive sp atial rela tionships in three -dimensional (3-D) sp ace is kno wn as depth p erception.
With depth p erception , we can describ e things as b eing in front , behind , above, below, or to the side o f other
things .
Our w orld is three -dimensional , so it mak es sense tha t our mental representa tion o f the w orld has three -
dimensional prop erties. We use a v ariety o f cues in a visual sc ene to es tablish our sense o f depth . Some o f
these are bino cular cues , which me ans tha t the y rely on the use o f both e yes. One e xample o f a bino cular
depth cue is bino cular disp arit y, the slightly diff erent view o f the w orld tha t each o f our e yes rec eives. To

fing ers and f ocus on tha t fing er. Now, close y our left e ye without mo ving y our he ad, then op en y our left e ye and
close y our right e ye without mo ving y our he ad. You will notic e tha t your fing er seems to shift as y ou alterna te
between the tw o eyes b ecause o f the slightly diff erent view e ach e ye has o f your fing er.
A 3-D mo vie w orks on the same principle: the sp ecial glas ses y ou w ear allo w the tw o slightly diff erent ima ges
projecte d onto the screen to b e seen sep arately b y your left and y our right e ye. As y our brain pro cesses these
ima ges, you ha ve the illusion tha t the le aping animal or r unning p erson is c oming right to ward y ou.
Although w e rely on bino cular cues to e xperienc e depth in our 3-D w orld , we can also p erceive depth in 2-D
arra ys. Think a bout all the p aintings and photographs y ou ha ve seen . Generally , you pick up on depth in these
ima ges ev en though the visual s timulus is 2-D . When w e do this , we are relying on a numb er o fmono cular
cues , or cues tha t require only one e ye. If y ou think y ou c an’t see depth with one e ye, note tha t you don ’t bump
into things when using only one e ye while w alking—and , in fact , we ha ve more mono cular cues than bino cular
cues .
An e xample o f a mono cular cue w ould b e wha t is kno wn as line ar p ersp ectiv e.Line ar p ersp ectiverefers to the
fact tha t we perceive depth when w e see tw o parallel lines tha t seem to c onverge in an ima ge (Figure 5.17 ).
Some other mono cular depth cues are interp osition , the p artial o verlap o f objects , and the rela tive siz e and
closenes s of ima ges to the horiz on.

By the end o f this section, y ou wil l be able t o:
•Describe the basic anat omy and function o f the audit ory system
•Explain ho w we enc ode and per ceive pit ch
•Discus s ho w we localiz e sound
Our a uditor y system c onverts pres sure w aves into me aningful sounds . This transla tes into our a bility to he ar
the sounds o f na ture , to apprecia te the b eauty o f music , and to c ommunic ate with one another through sp oken
langua ge. This section will pro vide an o verview o f the b asic ana tom y and function o f the a uditor y system . It
will include a discus sion o f ho w the sensor y stimulus is transla ted into neural impulses , where in the brain
that inf orma tion is pro cessed, how w e perceive pitch , and ho w w e kno w where sound is c oming from .
Anatomy of the A uditory System
The e ar can b e sep arated into multiple sections . The outer e ar includes the pinna , which is the visible p art of
the e ar tha t protr udes from our he ads, the a uditor y canal , and the tymp anic membrane , or e ardr um. The
middle e ar contains three tin y bones kno wn as the ossicles , which are name d the malleus (or hammer), incus
(or an vil), and the stapes(or s tirrup). The inner e ar contains the semi-circular c anals , which are in volved in
balanc e and mo vement (the v estibular sense), and the c ochle a. The cochle ais a fluid-fille d, snail-shap ed
structure tha t contains the sensor y rec eptor c ells ( hair c ells) o f the a uditor y system ( Figure 5.18 ).
FIGURE 5.18 The ear is divided int o out er (pinna and tympanic membr ane), middle (the thr ee os sicles: mal leus ,
incus , and s tapes), and inner (c ochlea and basilar membr ane) divisions .
Sound w aves tra vel along the a uditor y canal and s trike the tymp anic membrane , causing it to vibra te. This
vibra tion results in mo vement o f the three os sicles . As the os sicles mo ve, the s tapes pres ses into a thin
membrane o f the c ochle a kno wn as the o val windo w. As the s tapes pres ses into the o val windo w, the fluid
inside the c ochle a begins to mo ve, which in turn s timula teshair c ells, which are a uditor y rec eptor c ells o f the
inner e ar emb edde d in the b asilar membrane . The basilar membrane is a thin s trip o f tissue within the
cochle a.5.4 • Hearing 161
The activ ation o f hair c ells is a mechanic al pro cess: the s timula tion o f the hair c ell ultima tely le ads to
activ ation o f the c ell. As hair c ells b ecome activ ated, the y genera te neural impulses tha t tra vel along the
auditor y ner ve to the brain . Auditor y inf orma tion is shut tled to the inf erior c olliculus , the me dial g enicula te
nucleus o f the thalamus , and finally to the a uditor y cortex in the temp oral lob e of the brain f or pro cessing . Lik e
the visual s ystem , there is also evidenc e sugg esting tha t inf orma tion a bout a uditor y rec ognition and
localiza tion is pro cessed in p arallel s treams (Ra uscheck er & Tian , 2000; R enier et al ., 2009).
Pitch P erception
Different fre quencies o f sound w aves are as sociated with diff erenc es in our p erception o f the pitch o f those
sounds . Low-fre quency sounds are lo wer pitche d, and high-fre quency sounds are higher pitche d. Ho w do es
the a uditor y system diff erentia te among v arious pitches?
Several theories ha ve been prop osed to ac count f or pitch p erception . We’ll discus s tw o of them here: temp oral
theor y and plac e theor y. The temp oral theor yof pitch p erception as serts tha t fre quency is c oded by the
activity lev el of a sensor y neuron . This w ould me an tha t a giv en hair c ell w ould fire action p otentials rela ted to
the fre quency o f the sound w ave. While this is a v ery intuitiv e explana tion , we detect such a bro ad rang e of
frequencies (20–20,000 Hz) tha t the fre quency o f action p otentials fire d by hair c ells c annot ac count f or the
entire rang e. Bec ause o f prop erties rela ted to so dium channels on the neuronal membrane tha t are in volved in
action p otentials , there is a p oint a t which a c ell c annot fire an y fas ter (Shamma, 2001).
The plac e theor yof pitch p erception sugg ests tha t diff erent p ortions o f the b asilar membrane are sensitiv e to
sounds o f diff erent fre quencies . More sp ecific ally, the b ase o f the b asilar membrane resp onds b est to high
frequencies and the tip o f the b asilar membrane resp onds b est to lo w fre quencies . Theref ore, hair c ells tha t
are in the b ase p ortion w ould b e labeled as high-pitch rec eptors , while those in the tip o f basilar membrane
would b e labeled as lo w-pitch rec eptors (Shamma, 2001).
In re ality , both theories e xplain diff erent asp ects o f pitch p erception . At fre quencies up to a bout 4000 Hz, it is
clear tha t both the ra te of action p otentials and plac e contribute to our p erception o f pitch . Ho wever, much
higher fre quency sounds c an only b e enc oded using plac e cues (Shamma, 2001).
Sound Localiz ation
The a bility to lo cate sound in our en vironments is an imp ortant p art ofhearing . Localizing sound c ould b e
considere d similar to the w ay tha t we perceive depth in our visual fields . Lik e the mono cular and bino cular
cues tha t pro vide d inf orma tion a bout depth , the a uditor y system uses b oth monaural (one -eared) and
binaural (two-eared) cues to lo calize sound .
Each pinna interacts with inc oming sound w aves diff erently , dep ending on the sound ’s sourc e rela tive to our
bodies . This interaction pro vides a mona ural cue tha t is helpful in lo cating sounds tha t occur a bove or b elow
and in front or b ehind us . The sound w aves rec eived by your tw o ears from sounds tha t come from directly
above, below, in front , or b ehind y ou w ould b e identic al; theref ore, mona ural cues are es sential (Grothe , Pecka,
& Mc Alpine , 2010).
Bina ural cues , on the other hand , pro vide inf orma tion on the lo cation o f a sound along a horiz ontal axis b y
relying on diff erenc es in p atterns o f vibra tion o f the e ardr um b etween our tw o ears. If a sound c omes from an
off-center lo cation , it cre ates tw o typ es o f bina ural cues: intera ural lev el diff erenc es and intera ural timing
differenc es.Interaural le vel diff erenc erefers to the fact tha t a sound c oming from the right side o f your b ody
is more intense a t your right e ar than a t your left e ar b ecause o f the a ttenua tion o f the sound w ave as it p asses
through y our he ad.Interaural t iming diff erenc erefers to the small diff erenc e in the time a t which a giv en
sound w ave arriv es a t each e ar (Figure 5.19 ). Certain brain are as monitor these diff erenc es to c onstruct where
along a horiz ontal axis a sound origina tes (Grothe et al ., 2010).162 5 • Sensa tion and P erception

exposure (noise -induc ed he aring los s, as sho wn in Figure 5.20 ), tumors , and to xins (such as those f ound in
certain solv ents and metals).

By the end o f this section, y ou wil l be able t o:
•Describe the basic functions o f the chemical senses
•Explain the basic functions o f the somat osensor y, nocic eptive, and thermoc eptive sensor y systems
•Describe the basic functions o f the v estibular , proprioc eptive, and kines thetic sensor y systems
Vision and he aring ha ve rec eived an incre dible amount o f attention from rese archers o ver the y ears. While
there is s till much to b e learne d about ho w these sensor y systems w ork, we ha ve a much b etter unders tanding
of them than o f our other sensor y mo dalities . In this section , we will e xplore our chemic al senses (tas te and
smell) and our b ody senses (touch , temp erature , pain, balanc e, and b ody p osition).
The Chemical Senses
Taste (gustation) and smell (olfaction) are c alled chemic al senses b ecause b oth ha ve sensor y rec eptors tha t
resp ond to molecules in the f ood we eat or in the air w e bre athe. There is a pronounc ed interaction b etween
our chemic al senses . For e xample , when w e describ e the fla vor o f a giv en f ood, we are re ally ref erring to b oth
gustatory and olfactor y prop erties o f the f ood working in c ombina tion .

Taste (Gustation)
You ha ve learne d sinc e elementar y scho ol tha t there are f our b asic groupings o f tas te: s weet, salty , sour , and
bitter. Research demons trates, however, tha t we ha ve at least six tastegroupings . Umami is our fifth tas te.
Umami is actually a J apanese w ord tha t roughly transla tes to yumm y, and it is as sociated with a tas te for
monoso dium glutama te (Kinnamon & V andenb euch , 2009). There is also a gro wing b ody o f experimental
evidenc e sugg esting tha t we possess a tas te for the fa tty content o f a giv en f ood (Mizushig e, Inoue , & F ushiki ,
2007).
Molecules from the f ood and b everages w e consume dis solv e in our saliv a and interact with tas te rec eptors on
our tongue and in our mouth and thro at.Taste buds are f orme d by groupings o f tas te rec eptor c ells with hair -
like extensions tha t protr ude into the c entral p ore o f the tas te bud ( Figure 5.21 ). Taste buds ha ve a lif e cy cle o f
ten da ys to tw o weeks , so ev en des troying some b y burning y our tongue w on’t ha ve an y long-term eff ect; the y
just gro w right b ack. Taste molecules bind to rec eptors on this e xtension and c ause chemic al chang es within
the sensor y cell tha t result in neural impulses b eing transmit ted to the brain via diff erent ner ves, dep ending
on where the rec eptor is lo cated. Taste inf orma tion is transmit ted to the me dulla, thalamus , and limbic
system , and to the gus tatory cortex, which is tuck ed underne ath the o verlap b etween the frontal and temp oral
lobes (Ma ffei, Hale y, & F ontanini , 2012; R oper, 2013).

Smell (Olf action)
Olfactor y rec eptor cells are lo cated in a muc ous membrane a t the top o f the nose . Small hair -like extensions
from these rec eptors ser ve as the sites f or o dor molecules dis solv ed in the mucus to interact with chemic al
receptors lo cated on these e xtensions ( Figure 5.22 ). Onc e an o dor molecule has b ound a giv en rec eptor ,
chemic al chang es within the c ell result in signals b eing sent to the olfactor y bulb : a bulb -like structure a t the
tip o f the frontal lob e where the olfactor y ner ves b egin . From the olfactor y bulb , inf orma tion is sent to regions
of the limbic s ystem and to the primar y olfactor y cortex, which is lo cated very ne ar the gus tatory cortex
(Lodovichi & Belluscio , 2012; S pors et al ., 2013).5.5 • The Other Senses 165
FIGURE 5.22 Olfact ory receptors ar e the hair -like par ts that e xtend fr om the olfact ory bulb int o the muc ous
membr ane o f the nasal ca vity.
There is tremendous v aria tion in the sensitivity o f the olfactor y systems o f diff erent sp ecies . We often think o f
dogs as ha ving far sup erior olfactor y systems than our o wn, and indee d, dogs c an do some remarka ble things
with their noses . There is some evidenc e to sugg est tha t dogs c an “ smell ” dang erous drops in blo od gluc ose
levels as w ell as c ancerous tumors ( Wells, 2010). Dogs’ e xtraordinar y olfactor y abilities ma y be due to the
incre ased numb er o f functional g enes f or olfactor y rec eptors ( between 800 and 1200), c omp ared to the f ewer
than 400 obser ved in humans and other prima tes (Niimura & N ei, 2007).
Man y sp ecies resp ond to chemic al mes sages, kno wn as pheromones , sent b y another individual ( Wysocki &
Preti, 2004). Pheromonal c ommunic ation o ften in volves pro viding inf orma tion a bout the repro ductiv e status
of a p otential ma te. So, for e xample , when a f emale ra t is re ady to ma te, it secretes pheromonal signals tha t
draw attention from ne arby male ra ts. Pheromonal activ ation is actually an imp ortant c omp onent in eliciting
sexual b ehavior in the male ra t (Furlo w, 1996, 2012; Pur vis & Ha ynes , 1972; Sachs , 1997). There has also b een
a good de al of rese arch (and c ontro versy) about pheromones in humans (C omf ort, 1971; R ussell, 1976;
Wolfg ang-Kimb all, 1992; W eller , 1998).
Touch, Thermoception, and Nociception
A numb er o f rec eptors are dis tribute d throughout the skin to resp ond to v arious touch-rela ted stimuli ( Figure
5.23 ). These rec eptors include Meis sner ’s corpuscles , Pacinian c orpuscles , Merk el’s disks , and R uffini
corpuscles .Meis sner ’s corpuscles resp ond to pres sure and lo wer fre quency vibra tions , and Pacinian
corpuscles detect transient pres sure and higher fre quency vibra tions .Merk el’s disk sresp ond to light
pres sure , while Ruffini c orpuscles detect s tretch (Abraira & Ginty , 2013).166 5 • Sensa tion and P erception

FIGURE 5.23 Ther e are man y types o f sensor y receptors locat ed in the skin, each at tuned t o specific t ouch-r elated
stimuli.
In addition to the rec eptors lo cated in the skin , there are also a numb er o f free ner ve endings tha t ser ve
sensor y functions . These ner ve endings resp ond to a v ariety o f diff erent typ es o f touch-rela ted stimuli and
serve as sensor y rec eptors f or b oth thermo ception (temp erature p erception) and nociception (a signal
indic ating p otential harm and ma ybe pain) (G arland , 2012; P etho & R eeh, 2012; S pray, 1986). Sensor y
informa tion c ollecte d from the rec eptors and free ner ve endings tra vels up the spinal c ord and is transmit ted
to regions o f the me dulla, thalamus , and ultima tely to soma tosensor y cortex, which is lo cated in the
postcentral g yrus o f the p arietal lob e.
Pain P erception
Pain is an unple asant e xperienc e tha t involves b oth ph ysical and ps ychologic al comp onents . Feeling p ain is
quite adaptiv e because it mak es us a ware o f an injur y, and it motiv ates us to remo ve ourselv es from the c ause
of tha t injur y. In addition , pain also mak es us les s lik ely to suff er additional injur y because w e will b e gentler
with our injure d body p arts.
Generally sp eaking , pain c an b e considere d to b e neurop athic or inflamma tory in na ture . Pain tha t signals
some typ e of tissue dama ge is kno wn as inflammator y pain. In some situa tions , pain results from dama ge to
neurons o f either the p eripheral or c entral ner vous s ystem . As a result , pain signals tha t are sent to the brain
get exaggerated. This typ e of pain is kno wn as neurop athic p ain. Multiple tre atment options f or p ain relief
rang e from relaxa tion therap y to the use o f analg esic me dications to deep brain s timula tion . The mos t eff ectiv e
treatment option f or a giv en individual will dep end on a numb er o f considera tions , including the sev erity and
persis tenc e of the p ain and an y me dical/ps ychologic al conditions .
Some individuals are b orn without the a bility to f eel p ain. This v ery rare g enetic disorder is kno wn as
cong enital insensit ivity to p ain (orcong enital analg esia ). While those with c ong enital analg esia c an detect
differenc es in temp erature and pres sure , the y cannot e xperienc e pain. As a result , the y often suff er signific ant
injuries . Young children ha ve serious mouth and tongue injuries b ecause the y ha ve bit ten themselv es
repeatedly. Not surprisingly , individuals suff ering from this disorder ha ve much shor ter lif e expectancies due
to their injuries and sec ondar y inf ections o f injure d sites (U .S. N ational Librar y of Me dicine , 2013).

The V estibular Sense, Pr oprioception, and Kinesthesia
The vestibular sense contributes to our a bility to maintain b alanc e and b ody p osture . As Figure 5.24 shows,
the major sensor y org ans (utricle , sac cule , and the three semicircular c anals) o f this s ystem are lo cated ne xt to
the c ochle a in the inner e ar. The v estibular org ans are fluid-fille d and ha ve hair c ells, similar to the ones f ound
5.5 • The Other Senses 167
in the a uditor y system , which resp ond to mo vement o f the he ad and gra vitational f orces. When these hair c ells
are s timula ted, the y send signals to the brain via the v estibular ner ve. Although w e ma y not b e consciously
aware o f our v estibular s ystem ’s sensor y inf orma tion under normal circums tanc es, its imp ortanc e is app arent
when w e experienc e motion sicknes s and/or dizzines s rela ted to inf ections o f the inner e ar (Khan & Chang ,
2013).
FIGURE 5.24 The major sensor y organs o f the v estibular s ystem ar e locat ed ne xt to the c ochlea in the inner ear .
These include the utricle , sac cule , and the thr ee semicir cular canals (pos terior , superior , and horiz ontal).
In addition to maintaining b alanc e, the v estibular s ystem c ollects inf orma tion critic al for c ontrolling
movement and the refle xes tha t mo ve various p arts of our b odies to c omp ensa te for chang es in b ody p osition .
Theref ore, both proprio ception (perception o f body p osition) and kines thesia (perception o f the b ody’s
movement through sp ace) interact with inf orma tion pro vide d by the v estibular s ystem .
These sensor y systems also g ather inf orma tion from rec eptors tha t resp ond to s tretch and tension in muscles ,
joints , skin , and tendons (Lackner & DiZio , 2005; P rosk e, 2006; P rosk e & G andevia, 2012). P roprio ceptiv e and
kines thetic inf orma tion tra vels to the brain via the spinal c olumn . Sev eral c ortical regions in addition to the
cereb ellum rec eive inf orma tion from and send inf orma tion to the sensor y org ans o f the proprio ceptiv e and
kines thetic s ystems .
5.6 Gestalt Principles of P erception
LEARNING OBJEC TIVES
By the end o f this section, y ou wil l be able t o:
•Explain the fig ure-ground r elationship
•Define Ges talt principles o f grouping
•Describe ho w per ceptual set is influenc ed b y an individual ’s char acteristics and mental s tate
In the e arly p art of the 20th c entur y, Max W ertheimer publishe d a p aper demons trating tha t individuals
perceived motion in rapidly flick ering s tatic ima ges—an insight tha t came to him as he use d a child ’s toy
tachis tosc ope. Wertheimer , and his as sistants W olfg ang K öhler and K urt Koffka, who la ter b ecame his
partners , believ ed tha t perception in volved more than simply c ombining sensor y stimuli . This b elief le d to a
new mo vement within the field o f psycholog y kno wn as Ges talt psy cholog y. The w ord gestalt literally me ans
form or p attern , but its use reflects the ide a tha t the whole is diff erent from the sum o f its p arts. In other w ords ,
the brain cre ates a p erception tha t is more than simply the sum o f available sensor y inputs , and it do es so in
predicta ble w ays. Ges talt ps ychologis ts transla ted these pre dicta ble w ays into principles b y which w e org aniz e
sensor y inf orma tion . As a result , Ges talt ps ycholog y has b een e xtremely influential in the are a of sensa tion168 5 • Sensa tion and P erception
Access for fr ee a t opens tax. org
and p erception (R ock & P almer , 1990).
One Ges talt principle is the figure -ground relat ionship . According to this principle , we tend to segment our
visual w orld into figure and ground . Figure is the object or p erson tha t is the f ocus o f the visual field , while the
ground is the b ackground . As Figure 5.25 shows, our p erception c an v ary tremendously , dep ending on wha t is
perceived as figure and wha t is p erceived as ground . Presuma bly, our a bility to interpret sensor y inf orma tion
dep ends on wha t we label as figure and wha t we label as ground in an y particular c ase, although this
assumption has b een c alled into ques tion (P eterson & Gibson , 1994; V ecera & O ’Reilly , 1998).
FIGURE 5.25 The c oncept of figure-ground r elationship e xplains wh y this imag e can be per ceived either as a v ase
or as a pair o f fac es.
Another Ges talt principle f or org anizing sensor y stimuli into me aningful p erception is proximit y. This
principle as serts tha t things tha t are close to one another tend to b e group ed tog ether , as Figure 5.26
illus trates.
FIGURE 5.26 The Ges talt principle o f proximity sug gests that y ou see (a) one block o f dots on the left side and (b)
three c olumns on the right side .
How w e re ad something pro vides another illus tration o f the pro ximity c oncept. For e xample , we re ad this
sentenc e lik e this , notl ik et hiso r t ha t. We group the let ters o f a giv en w ord tog ether b ecause there are no
spaces b etween the let ters , and w e perceive words b ecause there are sp aces b etween e ach w ord. Here are
some more e xamples: C any oum ak es enseo ft his s entenc e? Wha t doth es e w or dsme a n?
We might also use the principle o fsimilarit yto group things in our visual fields . According to this principle ,
things tha t are alik e tend to b e group ed tog ether ( Figure 5.27 ). For e xample , when w atching a f ootball g ame , we
tend to group individuals b ased on the c olors o f their unif orms . When w atching an o ffensiv e driv e, we can g et a5.6 • Ges talt Principles o f Perception 169
sense o f the tw o teams simply b y grouping along this dimension .
FIGURE 5.27 When looking at this arr ay of dots , we lik ely per ceive alternating r ows of colors . We are grouping these
dots ac cording t o the principle o f similarity .
Two additional Ges talt principles are the la w ofcontinuit y(orgood continuat ion) and closure . The la w of
continuity sugg ests tha t we are more lik ely to p erceive continuous , smo oth flo wing lines ra ther than ja gged,
brok en lines ( Figure 5.28 ). The principle of closure states tha t we org aniz e our p erceptions into c omplete
objects ra ther than as a series o f parts (Figure 5.29 ).

According to Ges talt theoris ts,pattern p erception, or our a bility to discrimina te among diff erent figures and
shap es, occurs b y following the principles describ ed above. You prob ably f eel fairly c ertain tha t your
perception ac cura tely ma tches the re al w orld , but this is not alw ays the c ase. Our p erceptions are b ased on
perceptual h ypotheses : educated gues ses tha t we mak e while interpreting sensor y inf orma tion . These
hypotheses are inf orme d by a numb er o f factors , including our p ersonalities , experienc es, and e xpecta tions .
We use these h ypotheses to g enera te our p erceptual set . For ins tanc e, rese arch has demons trated tha t those
who are giv en v erbal priming pro duce a biase d interpreta tion o f comple x ambiguous figures (Go olkasian &

The Depths of P erception: Bias, Pr ejudice, and Cultur al F actors
In this chap ter, you ha ve learned that per ception is a c omple x process. Buil t from sensations , but influenc ed b y

Resear ch sug gests that implicit r acial prejudic eand stereotypes affect per ception. F or ins tanc e, several studies
have demons trated that non-Black par ticipants identif y weapons fas ter and ar e mor e lik ely to identif y non-

Summary
5.1 Sensation versus P erception
Sensa tion o ccurs when sensor y rec eptors detect sensor y stimuli . Perception in volves the org aniza tion ,
interpreta tion , and c onscious e xperienc e of those sensa tions . All sensor y systems ha ve both a bsolute and
differenc e thresholds , which ref er to the minimum amount o f stimulus energ y or the minimum amount o f
differenc e in s timulus energ y re quire d to b e detecte d about 50% o f the time , resp ectiv ely. Sensor y adapta tion ,
selectiv e attention , and signal detection theor y can help e xplain wha t is p erceived and wha t is not . In addition ,
our p erceptions are a ffecte d by a numb er o f factors , including b eliefs , values , prejudic es, culture , and lif e
experienc es.
5.2 Waves and W avelengths
Both light and sound c an b e describ ed in terms o f wave forms with ph ysical characteris tics lik e amplitude ,
wavelength , and timbre . Wavelength and fre quency are in versely rela ted so tha t long er w aves ha ve lower
frequencies , and shor ter w aves ha ve higher fre quencies . In the visual s ystem , a light w ave’s wavelength is
generally as sociated with c olor , and its amplitude is as sociated with brightnes s. In the a uditor y system , a
sound ’s fre quency is as sociated with pitch , and its amplitude is as sociated with loudnes s.
5.3 Vision
Light w aves cros s the c orne a and enter the e ye at the pupil . The e ye’s lens f ocuses this light so tha t the ima ge is
focuse d on a region o f the retina kno wn as the f ovea. The f ovea contains c ones tha t possess high lev els o f
visual acuity and op erate best in bright light c onditions . Rods are lo cated throughout the retina and op erate
best under dim light c onditions . Visual inf orma tion le aves the e ye via the optic ner ve. Inf orma tion from e ach
visual field is sent to the opp osite side o f the brain a t the optic chiasm . Visual inf orma tion then mo ves through
a numb er o f brain sites b efore re aching the o ccipital lob e, where it is pro cessed.
Two theories e xplain c olor p erception . The trichroma tic theor y as serts tha t three dis tinct c one groups are
tune d to slightly diff erent w avelengths o f light , and it is the c ombina tion o f activity acros s these c one typ es tha t
results in our p erception o f all the c olors w e see . The opp onent -pro cess theor y of color vision as serts tha t color
is pro cessed in opp onent p airs and ac counts f or the interes ting phenomenon o f a neg ative afterima ge. We
perceive depth through a c ombina tion o f mono cular and bino cular depth cues .
5.4 Hearing
Sound w aves are funnele d into the a uditor y canal and c ause vibra tions o f the e ardr um; these vibra tions mo ve
the os sicles . As the os sicles mo ve, the s tapes pres ses a gains t the o val windo w of the c ochle a, which c auses fluid
inside the c ochle a to mo ve. As a result , hair c ells emb edde d in the b asilar membrane b ecome enlarg ed, which
sends neural impulses to the brain via the a uditor y ner ve.
Pitch p erception and sound lo caliza tion are imp ortant asp ects o f he aring . Our a bility to p erceive pitch relies
on b oth the firing ra te of the hair c ells in the b asilar membrane as w ell as their lo cation within the membrane .
In terms o f sound lo caliza tion , both mona ural and bina ural cues are use d to lo cate where sounds origina te in
our en vironment .
Individuals c an b e born de af, or the y can dev elop de afnes s as a result o f age, genetic pre disp osition , and/or
environmental c auses . He aring los s tha t results from a failure o f the vibra tion o f the e ardr um or the resultant
movement o f the os sicles is c alled conductiv e he aring los s. He aring los s tha t involves a failure o f the174 5 • Summar y

transmis sion o f auditor y ner ve impulses to the brain is c alled sensorineural he aring los s.
5.5 The Other Senses
Taste (gustation) and smell (olfaction) are chemic al senses tha t emplo y rec eptors on the tongue and in the
nose tha t bind directly with tas te and o dor molecules in order to transmit inf orma tion to the brain f or
processing . Our a bility to p erceive touch , temp erature , and p ain is me diated by a numb er o f rec eptors and free
nerve endings tha t are dis tribute d throughout the skin and v arious tis sues o f the b ody. The v estibular sense
helps us maintain a sense o f balanc e through the resp onse o f hair c ells in the utricle , sac cule , and semi-
circular c anals tha t resp ond to chang es in he ad p osition and gra vity. Our proprio ceptiv e and kines thetic
systems pro vide inf orma tion a bout b ody p osition and b ody mo vement through rec eptors tha t detect s tretch
and tension in the muscles , joints , tendons , and skin o f the b ody.
5.6 Gestalt Principles of P erception
Gestalt theoris ts ha ve been incre dibly influential in the are as o f sensa tion and p erception . Ges talt principles
such as figure -ground rela tionship , grouping b y pro ximity or similarity , the la w of good continua tion , and
closure are all use d to help e xplain ho w w e org aniz e sensor y inf orma tion . Our p erceptions are not infallible ,
and the y can b e influenc ed by bias , prejudic e, and other factors .

6.1 What Is Learning?
LEARNING OBJEC TIVES
By the end o f this section, y ou wil l be able t o:
•Explain ho w learned beha viors ar e diff erent fr om ins tincts and r eflexes
•Define learning
•Recogniz e and define thr ee basic f orms o f learning— clas sical c onditioning , oper ant c onditioning , and
obser vational learning
Birds build nes ts and migra te as winter appro aches . Infants suckle f or nurishment . Dogs shak e water o ff wet
fur. Salmon s wim ups tream to sp awn, and spiders spin intric ate w ebs. Wha t do these seemingly unrela ted
behaviors ha ve in c ommon? The y all are unle arne dbehaviors . Both ins tincts and refle xes are inna te
(unle arne d) b ehaviors tha t org anisms are b orn with .Refle xesare a motor or neural re action to a sp ecific
stimulus in the en vironment . The y tend to b e simpler than ins tincts , involve the activity o f specific b ody p arts
and s ystems (e .g., the knee -jerk refle x and the c ontraction o f the pupil in bright light), and in volve more
primitiv e centers o f the c entral ner vous s ystem (e .g., the spinal c ord and the me dulla). In c ontras t,instincts
are inna te behaviors tha t are trigg ered by a bro ader rang e of events , such as ma tura tion and the chang e of
seasons . The y are more c omple x patterns o f behavior , involve mo vement o f the org anism as a whole (e .g.,
sexual activity and migra tion), and in volve higher brain c enters .
Both refle xes and ins tincts help an org anism adapt to its en vironment and do not ha ve to b e learne d. For
example , every he alth y human b aby has a sucking refle x, present a t bir th. Babies are b orn kno wing ho w to
suck on a nipple , whether ar tificial (from a b ottle) or human . Nobody te aches the b aby to suck , jus t as no one
teaches a se a tur tle ha tchling to mo ve toward the o cean. Learning , like refle xes and ins tincts , allo ws an
organism to adapt to its en vironment . But unlik e ins tincts and refle xes, learne d behaviors in volve chang e and
experienc e:learning is a rela tively p ermanent chang e in b ehavior or kno wledge tha t results from e xperienc e.
In contras t to the inna te behaviors discus sed above, learning in volves ac quiring kno wledge and skills through
experienc e. Looking b ack a t our sur fing sc enario , Julian will ha ve to sp end much more time training with his
surfboard b efore he le arns ho w to ride the w aves lik e his fa ther .
Learning to sur f, as w ell as an y comple x learning pro cess (e.g., learning a bout the discipline o f psycholog y),
involves a c omple x interaction o f conscious and unc onscious pro cesses. Learning has traditionally b een
studie d in terms o f its simples t comp onents —the as sociations our minds a utoma tically mak e between ev ents .
Our minds ha ve a na tural tendency to c onnect ev ents tha t occur closely tog ether or in se quenc e.Associat ive
learning occurs when an org anism mak es c onnections b etween s timuli or ev ents tha t occur tog ether in the
environment . You will see tha t associative learning is c entral to all three b asic le arning pro cesses discus sed in
this chapter; clas sical conditioning tends to in volve unc onscious pro cesses, operant c onditioning tends to
involve conscious pro cesses, and obser vational le arning adds so cial and c ognitiv e layers to all the b asic
associative pro cesses, both c onscious and unc onscious . These le arning pro cesses will b e discus sed in detail
later in the chapter , but it is helpful to ha ve a brief o verview o f each as y ou b egin to e xplore ho w le arning is
unders tood from a ps ychologic al persp ectiv e.
In clas sical conditioning , also kno wn as P avlovian c onditioning , org anisms le arn to as sociate ev ents —or
stimuli—tha t rep eatedly happ en tog ether . We experienc e this pro cess throughout our daily liv es. For e xample ,
you might see a flash o f lightning in the sky during a s torm and then he ar a loud b oom o f thunder . The sound o f
the thunder na turally mak es y ou jump ( loud noises ha ve tha t eff ect b y refle x). Bec ause lightning relia bly
predicts the imp ending b oom o f thunder , you ma y as sociate the tw o and jump when y ou see lightning .
Psychologic al rese archers s tudy this as sociative pro cess by focusing on wha t can b e seen and
measure d—b ehaviors . Researchers ask if one s timulus trigg ers a refle x, can w e train a diff erent s timulus to
trigg er tha t same refle x? In op erant c onditioning , org anisms le arn, again, to as sociate ev ents —a b ehavior and
its c onse quenc e (reinf orcement or punishment). A ple asant c onse quenc e enc oura ges more o f tha t behavior in
the future , where as a punishment deters the b ehavior . Ima gine y ou are te aching y our dog , Ho dor, to sit . You182 6 • L earning

tell Ho dor to sit , and giv e him a tre at when he do es. After rep eated experienc es, Ho dor b egins to as sociate the
act o f sitting with rec eiving a tre at. He le arns tha t the c onse quenc e of sitting is tha t he g ets a doggie biscuit
(Figure 6.2 ). Conversely , if the dog is punishe d when e xhibiting a b ehavior , it b ecomes c onditione d to a void
that behavior (e .g., rec eiving a small sho ck when cros sing the b oundar y of an in visible electric f ence).
FIGURE 6.2 In oper ant c onditioning , a response is as sociat ed with a c onsequenc e. This dog has learned that
certain beha viors r esul t in r eceiving a tr eat. (cr edit: Cr ystal R olfe)
Obser vational le arning e xtends the eff ectiv e rang e of both clas sical and op erant c onditioning . In c ontras t to
clas sical and op erant c onditioning , in which le arning o ccurs only through direct e xperienc e, obser vational
learning is the pro cess of watching others and then imita ting wha t the y do . A lot o f learning among humans
and other animals c omes from obser vational le arning . To get an ide a of the e xtra eff ectiv e rang e tha t
obser vational le arning brings , consider Ben and his son J ulian from the intro duction . Ho w might obser vation
help J ulian le arn to sur f, as opp osed to le arning b y trial and error alone? B y watching his fa ther , he c an imita te
the mo ves tha t bring suc cess and a void the mo ves tha t lead to failure . Can y ou think o f something y ou ha ve
learne d ho w to do a fter w atching someone else?
All of the appro aches c overed in this chapter are p art of a p articular tradition in ps ycholog y, called
behaviorism , which w e discus s in the ne xt section . Ho wever, these appro aches do not represent the entire
study o f learning . Sep arate traditions o f learning ha ve tak en shap e within diff erent fields o f psycholog y, such
as memor y and c ognition , so y ou will find tha t other chapters will round out y our unders tanding o f the topic .
Over time these traditions tend to c onverge. For e xample , in this chapter y ou will see ho w cognition has c ome
to pla y a larg er role in b ehaviorism , whose more e xtreme adherents onc e insis ted tha t behaviors are trigg ered
by the en vironment with no inter vening thought .

FIGURE 6.3 Ivan P avlov’s resear ch on the dig estive system o f dogs une xpect edly led t o his disc overy of the learning

Pavlov came to his c onclusions a bout ho w le arning o ccurs c ompletely b y ac cident . Pavlov was a ph ysiologis t,
not a ps ychologis t. Physiologis ts study the lif e pro cesses o f org anisms , from the molecular lev el to the lev el of
cells, org an s ystems , and entire org anisms . Pavlov’s are a of interes t was the dig estive system (Hunt , 2007). In
his s tudies with dogs , Pavlov me asure d the amount o f saliv a pro duced in resp onse to v arious f oods. Over time ,
Pavlov (1927) obser ved tha t the dogs b egan to saliv ate not only a t the tas te of food, but also a t the sight o f food,
at the sight o f an empty f ood bowl, and ev en a t the sound o f the la boratory as sistants ' footsteps . Saliv ating to
food in the mouth is refle xive, so no le arning is in volved. Ho wever, dogs don ’t na turally saliv ate at the sight o f
an empty b owl or the sound o f footsteps .
These unusual resp onses intrigue d Pavlov, and he w ondere d wha t accounte d for wha t he c alled the dogs '
“psychic secretions” (P avlov, 1927). T o explore this phenomenon in an objectiv e manner , Pavlov designe d a
series o f carefully c ontrolle d experiments to see which s timuli w ould c ause the dogs to saliv ate. He w as a ble to
train the dogs to saliv ate in resp onse to s timuli tha t cle arly had nothing to do with f ood, such as the sound o f a
bell, a light , and a touch on the leg . Through his e xperiments , Pavlov re alized tha t an org anism has tw o typ es o f
resp onses to its en vironment: (1) unc onditione d (unle arne d) resp onses , or refle xes, and (2) c onditione d
(learne d) resp onses .
In P avlov’s experiments , the dogs saliv ated each time me at powder w as presente d to them . The me at powder
in this situa tion w as an unc ondit ione d stimulus (UCS ): a s timulus tha t elicits a refle xive resp onse in an
organism . The dogs’ saliv ation w as an unc ondit ione d resp onse (UCR) : a na tural (unle arne d) re action to a
given s timulus . Bef ore c onditioning , think o f the dogs’ s timulus and resp onse lik e this:
In clas sical conditioning , a neutral s timulus is presente d imme diately b efore an unc onditione d stimulus .
Pavlov would sound a tone ( like ringing a b ell) and then giv e the dogs the me at powder ( Figure 6.4 ). The tone
was the neutral s timulus (NS ), which is a s timulus tha t do es not na turally elicit a resp onse . Prior to
conditioning , the dogs did not saliv ate when the y jus t he ard the tone b ecause the tone had no as sociation f or
the dogs .
When P avlov paire d the tone with the me at powder o ver and o ver a gain, the previously neutral s timulus (the
tone) also b egan to elicit saliv ation from the dogs . Thus , the neutral s timulus b ecame the condit ione d
stimulus (CS ), which is a s timulus tha t elicits a resp onse a fter rep eatedly b eing p aire d with an unc onditione d
stimulus . Eventually , the dogs b egan to saliv ate to the tone alone , jus t as the y previously had saliv ated at the
sound o f the as sistants’ f ootsteps . The b ehavior c aused by the c onditione d stimulus is c alled the condit ione d
resp onse (CR) . In the c ase o f Pavlov’s dogs , the y had le arne d to as sociate the tone (CS ) with b eing f ed, and the y
began to saliv ate (CR) in anticip ation o f food.184 6 • L earning

Real W orld Application of Classical Conditioning
How do es clas sical conditioning w ork in the re al w orld? C onsider the c ase o f Moisha, who w as dia gnose d with
cancer. When she rec eived her firs t chemotherap y tre atment , she v omite d shor tly a fter the chemic als w ere
injecte d. In fact , every trip to the do ctor f or chemotherap y tre atment shor tly a fter the dr ugs w ere injecte d, she
vomite d. Moisha ’s tre atment w as a suc cess and her c ancer w ent into remis sion . Now, when she visits her
oncologis t's office ev ery 6 months f or a check -up, she b ecomes na useous . In this c ase, the chemotherap y dr ugs
are the unc onditione d stimulus (UCS ), vomiting is the unc onditione d resp onse (UCR), the do ctor ’s office is the
conditione d stimulus (CS ) after b eing p aire d with the UCS, and na usea is the c onditione d resp onse (CR). Let 's
assume tha t the chemotherap y dr ugs tha t Moisha tak es are giv en through a s yring e injection . After entering
the do ctor 's office, Moisha sees a s yring e, and then g ets her me dication . In addition to the do ctor 's office,
Moisha will le arn to as sociate the s yring e with the me dication and will resp ond to s yring es with na usea. This is
an e xample o f higher -order (or sec ond-order) c onditioning , when the c onditione d stimulus (the do ctor 's office)
serves to c ondition another s timulus (the s yring e). It is hard to achiev e an ything a bove sec ond-order
conditioning . For e xample , if someone rang a b ell ev ery time Moisha rec eived a s yring e injection o f
chemotherap y dr ugs in the do ctor 's office, Moisha lik ely will nev er g et sick in resp onse to the b ell.
Consider another e xample o f clas sical conditioning . Let ’s sa y you ha ve a c at name d Tig er, who is quite sp oiled.
You k eep her f ood in a sep arate cabinet , and y ou also ha ve a sp ecial electric c an op ener tha t you use only to

and then g ets her f ood. Tig er quickly le arns tha t when she he ars “zzhzhz ” she is a bout to g et fed. Wha t do y ou

prep aring her f ood. This is an e xample o f clas sical conditioning . In this c ase, wha t are the UCS, CS, UCR , and
CR?
Wha t if the c abinet holding Tig er’s food becomes sque aky? In tha t case, Tig er he ars “ sque ak” (the c abinet),
“zzhzhz ” (the electric c an op ener), and then she g ets her f ood. Tig er will le arn to g et excited when she he ars
the “ sque ak” of the c abinet . Pairing a new neutral s timulus (“ sque ak”) with the c onditione d stimulus
(“zzhzhz ”) is c alledhigher -order c ondit ioning , orsecond-order c ondit ioning . This me ans y ou are using the
conditione d stimulus o f the c an op ener to c ondition another s timulus: the sque aky c abinet ( Figure 6.5 ). It is
hard to achiev e an ything a bove sec ond-order c onditioning . For e xample , if y ou ring a b ell, open the c abinet
(“sque ak”), use the c an op ener (“zzhzhz ”), and then f eed Tig er, Tig er will lik ely nev er g et excited when he aring
the b ell alone .

disc omf ort (unc onditione d resp onse) with the e dge of the y ard (c onditione d stimulus) and s tays within the set

Gener al Pr ocesses in Classical Conditioning
Now tha t you kno w ho w clas sical conditioning w orks and ha ve seen sev eral e xamples , let’s tak e a lo ok a t some
of the g eneral pro cesses in volved. In clas sical conditioning , the initial p erio d of learning is kno wn as
acquisit ion, when an org anism le arns to c onnect a neutral s timulus and an unc onditione d stimulus . During
acquisition , the neutral s timulus b egins to elicit the c onditione d resp onse , and ev entually the neutral s timulus
becomes a c onditione d stimulus c apable o f eliciting the c onditione d resp onse b y itself. Timing is imp ortant f or
conditioning to o ccur. Typic ally, there should only b e a brief inter val between presenta tion o f the c onditione d
stimulus and the unc onditione d stimulus . Dep ending on wha t is b eing c onditione d, sometimes this inter val is
as lit tle as fiv e sec onds (Chanc e, 2009). Ho wever, with other typ es o f conditioning , the inter val can b e up to
several hours .
Taste aversion is a typ e of conditioning in which an inter val of sev eral hours ma y pass between the
conditione d stimulus (something ing ested) and the unc onditione d stimulus (na usea or illnes s). Here ’s ho w it
works . Betw een clas ses, you and a friend gra b a quick lunch from a f ood cart on c ampus . You share a dish o f
chick en curr y and he ad o ff to y our ne xt clas s. A f ew hours la ter, you f eel na useous and b ecome ill . Although
your friend is fine and y ou determine tha t you ha ve intes tinal flu (the f ood is not the culprit), y ou’ve dev elop ed
a tas te aversion; the ne xt time y ou are a t a res taurant and someone orders curr y, you imme diately f eel ill .
While the chick en dish is not wha t made y ou sick , you are e xperiencing tas te aversion: y ou’ve been
conditione d to b e averse to a f ood after a single , bad e xperienc e.
How do es this o ccur—conditioning b ased on a single ins tanc e and in volving an e xtende d time lapse b etween
the ev ent and the neg ative stimulus? R esearch into tas te aversion sugg ests tha t this resp onse ma y be an
evolutionar y adapta tion designe d to help org anisms quickly le arn to a void harmful f oods (G arcia & R usiniak ,
1980; G arcia & K oelling , 1966). N ot only ma y this c ontribute to sp ecies sur vival via na tural selection , but it
may also help us dev elop s trategies f or challeng es such as helping c ancer p atients through the na usea induc ed
by certain tre atments (Holmes , 1993; J acobsen et al ., 1993; Hut ton, Barac os, & W ismer , 2007; Sk olin et al .,
2006). G arcia and K oelling (1966) sho wed not only tha t tas te aversions c ould b e conditione d, but also tha t
there w ere biologic al constraints to le arning . In their s tudy , sep arate groups o f rats w ere c onditione d to
associate either a fla vor with illnes s, or lights and sounds with illnes s. Results sho wed tha t all ra ts exposed to
flavor-illnes s pairings le arne d to a void the fla vor, but none o f the ra ts exposed to lights and sounds with illnes s
learne d to a void lights or sounds . This adde d evidenc e to the ide a tha t clas sical conditioning c ould c ontribute
to sp ecies sur vival by helping org anisms le arn to a void s timuli tha t posed re al dang ers to he alth and w elfare .
Robert Rescorla demons trated ho w powerfully an org anism c an le arn to pre dict the UCS from the CS. T ake, for
example , the f ollowing tw o situa tions . Ari ’s dad alw ays has dinner on the ta ble ev ery da y at 6:00. Sora ya’s mom
switches it up so tha t some da ys the y eat dinner a t 6:00, some da ys the y eat at 5:00, and other da ys the y eat at
7:00. F or Ari , 6:00 relia bly and c onsis tently pre dicts dinner , so Ari will lik ely s tart feeling hungr y ev ery da y
right b efore 6:00, ev en if he 's had a la te snack . Sora ya, on the other hand , will b e les s lik ely to as sociate 6:00
with dinner , sinc e 6:00 do es not alw ays pre dict tha t dinner is c oming . Rescorla, along with his c olleague a t Yale
Univ ersity , Alan W agner , dev elop ed a ma thema tical formula tha t could b e use d to c alcula te the prob ability tha t
an as sociation w ould b e learne d giv en the a bility o f a c onditione d stimulus to pre dict the o ccurrenc e of an
unc onditione d stimulus and other factors; to day this is kno wn as the R escorla-W agner mo del (R escorla &
Wagner , 1972)
Onc e we ha ve es tablishe d the c onnection b etween the unc onditione d stimulus and the c onditione d stimulus ,
how do w e bre ak tha t connection and g et the dog , cat, or child to s top resp onding? In Tig er’s case, ima gine
wha t would happ en if y ou s topp ed using the electric c an op ener f or her f ood and b egan to use it only f or
human f ood. Now, Tig er w ould he ar the c an op ener , but she w ould not g et food. In clas sical conditioning terms ,
you w ould b e giving the c onditione d stimulus , but not the unc onditione d stimulus . Pavlov explore d this
scenario in his e xperiments with dogs: sounding the tone without giving the dogs the me at powder. Soon the
dogs s topp ed resp onding to the tone .Extinct ion is the decre ase in the c onditione d resp onse when the188 6 • L earning

unc onditione d stimulus is no long er presente d with the c onditione d stimulus . When presente d with the
conditione d stimulus alone , the dog , cat, or other org anism w ould sho w a w eaker and w eaker resp onse , and
finally no resp onse . In clas sical conditioning terms , there is a gradual w eakening and disapp earanc e of the
conditione d resp onse .
Wha t happ ens when le arning is not use d for a while —when wha t was le arne d lies dormant? As w e jus t
discus sed, Pavlov found tha t when he rep eatedly presente d the b ell (c onditione d stimulus) without the me at
powder (unc onditione d stimulus), e xtinction o ccurre d; the dogs s topp ed saliv ating to the b ell. Ho wever, after a
couple o f hours o f res ting from this e xtinction training , the dogs a gain b egan to saliv ate when P avlov rang the
bell. Wha t do y ou think w ould happ en with Tig er’s behavior if y our electric c an op ener brok e, and y ou did not
use it f or sev eral months? When y ou finally g ot it fix ed and s tarted using it to op en Tig er’s food again, Tig er
would rememb er the as sociation b etween the c an op ener and her f ood—she w ould g et excited and r un to the
kitchen when she he ard the sound . The b ehavior o f Pavlov’s dogs and Tig er illus trates a c oncept P avlov called
spontaneous rec overy: the return o f a previously e xtinguishe d conditione d resp onse f ollowing a res t perio d
(Figure 6.7 ).
FIGURE 6.7 This is the cur ve of acquisition, e xtinction, and spontaneous r ecovery. The rising cur ve sho ws the
conditioned r esponse quickl y getting s tronger thr ough the r epeat ed pairing o f the c onditioned s timulus and the
unconditioned s timulus (ac quisition). Then the cur ve decr eases , which sho ws ho w the c onditioned r esponse
weakens when onl y the c onditioned s timulus is pr esent ed (e xtinction). Aft er a br eak or pause fr om c onditioning , the
conditioned r esponse r eappears (spontaneous r ecovery).
Of c ourse , these pro cesses also apply in humans . For e xample , let’s sa y tha t every da y when y ou w alk to
campus , an ic e cre am tr uck p asses y our route . Da y after da y, you he ar the tr uck ’s music (neutral s timulus), so
you finally s top and purchase a cho colate ic e cre am b ar. You tak e a bite (unc onditione d stimulus) and then
your mouth w aters (unc onditione d resp onse). This initial p erio d of learning is kno wn as ac quisition , when y ou
begin to c onnect the neutral s timulus (the sound o f the tr uck) and the unc onditione d stimulus (the tas te of the
chocolate ic e cre am in y our mouth). During ac quisition , the c onditione d resp onse g ets s trong er and s trong er
through rep eated pairings o f the c onditione d stimulus and unc onditione d stimulus . Sev eral da ys (and ic e
cream b ars) la ter, you notic e tha t your mouth b egins to w ater (c onditione d resp onse) as so on as y ou he ar the
truck ’s music al jingle —even b efore y ou bite into the ic e cre am b ar. Then one da y you he ad do wn the s treet . You
hear the tr uck ’s music (c onditione d stimulus), and y our mouth w aters (c onditione d resp onse). Ho wever, when
you g et to the tr uck, you disc over tha t the y are all out o f ice cre am. You le ave disapp ointe d. The ne xt few da ys
you p ass by the tr uck and he ar the music , but don ’t stop to g et an ic e cre am b ar b ecause y ou’re running la te for
clas s. You b egin to saliv ate les s and les s when y ou he ar the music , until b y the end o f the w eek, your mouth no
long er w aters when y ou he ar the tune . This illus trates e xtinction . The c onditione d resp onse w eakens when
only the c onditione d stimulus (the sound o f the tr uck) is presente d, without b eing f ollowed by the
unc onditione d stimulus (cho colate ic e cre am in the mouth). Then the w eekend c omes . You don ’t ha ve to g o to6.2 • Clas sical Conditioning 189

round the c orner and he ar the tr uck a gain. Wha t do y ou think happ ens? Y our mouth b egins to w ater a gain.
Why? After a bre ak from c onditioning , the c onditione d resp onse re app ears, which indic ates sp ontaneous
recovery.
Acquisition and e xtinction in volve the s trengthening and w eakening , resp ectiv ely, of a le arne d as sociation .
Two other le arning pro cesses—stimulus discrimina tion and s timulus g eneraliza tion—are in volved in
determining which s timuli will trigg er le arne d resp onses . Animals (including humans) nee d to dis tinguish
between s timuli— for e xample , between sounds tha t pre dict a thre atening ev ent and sounds tha t do not —so tha t
they can resp ond appropria tely (such as r unning a way if the sound is thre atening ). When an org anism le arns
to resp ond diff erently to v arious s timuli tha t are similar , it is c alledstimulus discriminat ion. In clas sical
conditioning terms , the org anism demons trates the c onditione d resp onse only to the c onditione d stimulus .
Pavlov’s dogs discrimina ted between the b asic tone tha t sounde d before the y were f ed and other tones (e .g.,
the do orbell), b ecause the other sounds did not pre dict the arriv al of food. Similarly , Tig er, the c at,
discrimina ted between the sound o f the c an op ener and the sound o f the electric mix er. When the electric
mix er is g oing , Tig er is not a bout to b e fed, so she do es not c ome r unning to the kitchen lo oking f or food. In our
other e xample , Moisha, the c ancer p atient , discrimina ted between onc ologis ts and other typ es o f do ctors . She
learne d not to f eel ill when visiting do ctors f or other typ es o f app ointments , such as her annual ph ysical.
On the other hand , when an org anism demons trates the c onditione d resp onse to s timuli tha t are similar to the
condition s timulus , it is c alledstimulus g eneralizat ion, the opp osite o f stimulus discrimina tion . The more
similar a s timulus is to the c ondition s timulus , the more lik ely the org anism is to giv e the c onditione d
resp onse . For ins tanc e, if the electric mix er sounds v ery similar to the electric c an op ener , Tig er ma y come
running a fter he aring its sound . But if y ou do not f eed her f ollowing the electric mix er sound , and y ou c ontinue
to feed her c onsis tently a fter the electric c an op ener sound , she will quickly le arn to discrimina te between the
two sounds (pro vide d the y are sufficiently dis similar tha t she c an tell them ap art). In our other e xample ,
Moisha c ontinue d to f eel ill whenev er visiting other onc ologis ts or other do ctors in the same building as her
oncologis t.
Behaviorism
John B .Watson , sho wn in Figure 6.8 , is c onsidere d the f ounder o f behaviorism . Beha viorism is a scho ol of
thought tha t arose during the firs t part of the 20th c entur y, which inc orporates elements o f Pavlov’s clas sical

FIGURE 6.8 John B . Watson used the principles o f clas sical c onditioning in the s tudy o f human emotion.
Watson ’s ide as w ere influenc ed by Pavlov’s work. According to W atson , human b ehavior , jus t lik e animal
behavior , is primarily the result o f conditione d resp onses . Where as P avlov’s work with dogs in volved the
conditioning o f refle xes, Watson b eliev ed the same principles c ould b e extende d to the c onditioning o f human
emotions ( Watson , 1919).
In 1920, while chair o f the ps ycholog y dep artment a t Johns Hopkins Univ ersity , Watson and his gradua te
student , Rosalie Ra yner , conducte d rese arch on a b aby nickname d Lit tle A lbert. Rayner and W atson ’s
experiments with Lit tle A lbert demons trated ho w fears c an b e conditione d using clas sical conditioning .
Through these e xperiments , Lit tle A lbert was e xposed to and c onditione d to f ear certain things . Initially he w as
presente d with v arious neutral s timuli , including a ra bbit , a dog , a monk ey, masks , cotton w ool, and a white
rat. He w as not a fraid o f an y of these things . Then W atson , with the help o f Ra yner , conditione d Lit tle A lbert to
associate these s timuli with an emotion— fear. For e xample , Watson hande d Lit tle A lbert the white ra t, and
Little A lbert enjo yed pla ying with it . Then W atson made a loud sound , by striking a hammer a gains t a metal
bar hanging b ehind Lit tle A lbert’s he ad, each time Lit tle A lbert touche d the ra t. Lit tle A lbert was frightene d by
the sound— demons trating a refle xive fear o f sudden loud noises —and b egan to cr y. Watson rep eatedly p aire d
the loud sound with the white ra t. Soon Lit tle A lbert became frightene d by the white ra t alone . In this c ase,
wha t are the UCS, CS, UCR , and CR ? Da ys later, Lit tle A lbert demons trated stimulus g eneraliza tion—he b ecame
afraid o f other furr y things: a ra bbit , a furr y coat, and ev en a Santa Cla us mask ( Figure 6.9 ). Watson had
succeeded in c onditioning a f ear resp onse in Lit tle A lbert, thus demons trating tha t emotions c ould b ecome
conditione d resp onses . It had b een W atson ’s intention to pro duce a phobia—a p ersis tent , excessive fear o f a
specific object or situa tion— through c onditioning alone , thus c ountering F reud ’s view tha t phobias are c aused
by deep , hidden c onflicts in the mind . Ho wever, there is no evidenc e tha t Lit tle A lbert experienc ed phobias in
later y ears. Lit tle A lbert’s mother mo ved away, ending the e xperiment . While W atson ’s rese arch pro vide d new
insight into c onditioning , it w ould b e considere d unethic al by today’s standards .

commer cials y ou ha ve seen on t elevision. Man y of them f eatur e an at tractiv e model . By associating the model
with the car being adv ertised, y ou c ome t o see the car as being desir able (Cialdini, 2008). Y ou ma y be asking
yourself , does this adv ertising t echnique actual ly work? Ac cording t o Cialdini (2008), men who vie wed a car
commer cial that included an at tractiv e model lat er rated the car as being fas ter, mor e appealing , and bet ter
designed than did men who vie wed an adv ertisement f or the same car minus the model .
Have you e ver notic ed ho w quickl y adv ertisers canc el contr acts with a famous athlet e following a scandal? As far
as the adv ertiser is c oncerned, that athlet e is no long er as sociat ed with positiv e feelings; ther efore, the athlet e
cannot be used as an unc onditioned s timulus t o condition the public t o as sociat e positiv e feelings (the
unconditioned r esponse) with their pr oduct (the c onditioned s timulus).
Now that y ou ar e aware of how as sociativ e learning w orks, see if y ou can find e xamples o f these types o f
advertisements on t elevision, in mag azines , or on the Int ernet.

Psychologis t B. F.Skinner saw tha t clas sical conditioning is limite d to e xisting b ehaviors tha t are refle xively
elicite d, and it do esn’t account f or new b ehaviors such as riding a bik e. He prop osed a theor y about ho w such
behaviors c ome a bout. Skinner b eliev ed tha t behavior is motiv ated by the c onse quenc es w e rec eive for the
behavior: the reinf orcements and punishments . His ide a tha t learning is the result o f conse quenc es is b ased
on the la w of eff ect, which w as firs t prop osed by ps ychologis t Edward Thorndik e. According to the law of
effect, behaviors tha t are f ollowed by conse quenc es tha t are sa tisfying to the org anism are more lik ely to b e
repeated, and b ehaviors tha t are f ollowed by unple asant c onse quenc es are les s lik ely to b e rep eated
(Thorndik e, 1911). Es sentially , if an org anism do es something tha t brings a bout a desire d result , the org anism
is more lik ely to do it a gain. If an org anism do es something tha t do es not bring a bout a desire d result , the
organism is les s lik ely to do it a gain. An e xample o f the la w of eff ect is in emplo yment . One o f the re asons (and
often the main re ason) w e sho w up f or w ork is b ecause w e get p aid to do so . If w e stop g etting p aid, we will
likely s top sho wing up —even if w e love our job .
Working with Thorndik e’s law of eff ect as his f ounda tion , Skinner b egan c onducting scientific e xperiments on
animals (mainly ra ts and pig eons) to determine ho w org anisms le arn through op erant c onditioning (Skinner ,
1938). He plac ed these animals inside an op erant c onditioning chamb er, which has c ome to b e kno wn as a
“Skinner b ox” (Figure 6.10 ). A Skinner b ox contains a lev er (f or ra ts) or disk (f or pig eons) tha t the animal c an

In discus sing op erant c onditioning , we use sev eral ev eryday words —positiv e, neg ative, reinf orcement , and

Reinf orcement means y ou are incre asing a b ehavior , and punishment means y ou are decre asing a b ehavior .
Reinf orcement c an b e positiv e or neg ative, and punishment c an also b e positiv e or neg ative. All reinf orcers

negative reinf orcement , positiv e punishment , and neg ative punishment ( Table 6.2 ).

Reinf orcement
The mos t eff ectiv e way to te ach a p erson or animal a new b ehavior is with p ositiv e reinf orcement . Inposit ive
reinf orcement , a desira ble s timulus is adde d to incre ase a b ehavior .
For e xample , you tell y our fiv e-year-old son , Jerome , tha t if he cle ans his ro om, he will g et a to y. Jerome quickly
cleans his ro om b ecause he w ants a new ar t set . Let ’s pause f or a moment . Some p eople might sa y, “Why
should I rew ard m y child f or doing wha t is e xpecte d?” But in fact w e are c onstantly and c onsis tently rew arde d
in our liv es. Our p aychecks are rew ards , as are high grades and ac ceptanc e into our pref erre d scho ol. Being
praise d for doing a g ood job and f or p assing a driv er’s tes t is also a rew ard. Positiv e reinf orcement as a
learning to ol is e xtremely eff ectiv e. It has b een f ound tha t one o f the mos t eff ectiv e ways to incre ase
achiev ement in scho ol dis tricts with b elow-average re ading sc ores w as to p ay the children to re ad. Specific ally,
second-grade s tudents in Dallas w ere p aid $2 e ach time the y re ad a b ook and p assed a shor t quiz a bout the
book. The result w as a signific ant incre ase in re ading c omprehension (F ryer, 2010). Wha t do y ou think a bout
this program? If Skinner w ere aliv e today, he w ould prob ably think this w as a gre at ide a. He w as a s trong
prop onent o f using op erant c onditioning principles to influenc e students’ b ehavior a t scho ol. In fact , in
addition to the Skinner b ox, he also in vente d wha t he c alled a te aching machine tha t was designe d to rew ard
small s teps in le arning (Skinner , 1961)—an e arly f orer unner o f computer -assisted learning . His te aching
machine tes ted students’ kno wledge as the y worked through v arious scho ol subjects . If s tudents ans wered
ques tions c orrectly , the y rec eived imme diate p ositiv e reinf orcement and c ould c ontinue; if the y ans wered
incorrectly , the y did not rec eive an y reinf orcement . The ide a was tha t students w ould sp end additional time
studying the ma terial to incre ase their chanc e of being reinf orced the ne xt time (Skinner , 1961).
Inneg ative reinf orcement , an undesira ble s timulus is remo ved to incre ase a b ehavior . For e xample , car
manufacturers use the principles o f neg ative reinf orcement in their se atbelt s ystems , which g o “b eep, beep,
beep” until y ou fas ten y our se atbelt. The anno ying sound s tops when y ou e xhibit the desire d behavior ,

incre asing the lik eliho od tha t you will buckle up in the future . Negative reinf orcement is also use d fre quently
in horse training . Riders apply pres sure —by pulling the reins or squee zing their legs —and then remo ve the
pres sure when the horse p erforms the desire d behavior , such as turning or sp eeding up . The pres sure is the
negative stimulus tha t the horse w ants to remo ve.
Punishment
Man y people c onfuse neg ative reinf orcement with punishment in op erant c onditioning , but the y are tw o very
different mechanisms . Rememb er tha t reinf orcement , even when it is neg ative, alw ays incre ases a b ehavior . In
contras t,punishment always decre ases a b ehavior . Inposit ive punishment , you add an undesira ble s timulus
to decre ase a b ehavior . An e xample o f positiv e punishment is sc olding a s tudent to g et the s tudent to s top
texting in clas s. In this c ase, a s timulus (the reprimand) is adde d in order to decre ase the b ehavior (te xting in
clas s). In neg ative punishment , you remo ve a ple asant s timulus to decre ase b ehavior . For e xample , when a
child misb ehaves, a p arent c an tak e away a fa vorite to y. In this c ase, a s timulus (the to y) is remo ved in order to
decre ase the b ehavior .
Punishment , esp ecially when it is imme diate, is one w ay to decre ase undesira ble b ehavior . For e xample ,
ima gine y our f our-year-old son , Brandon , hit his y oung er brother . You ha ve Brandon write 100 times “I will not
hit m y brother " (positiv e punishment). Chanc es are he w on’t rep eat this b ehavior . While s trategies lik e this are
common to day, in the p ast children w ere o ften subject to ph ysical punishment , such as sp anking . It’s
imp ortant to b e aware o f some o f the dra wbacks in using ph ysical punishment on children . First, punishment
may teach f ear. Brandon ma y become f earful o f the s treet , but he also ma y become f earful o f the p erson who
deliv ered the punishment —you, his p arent . Similarly , children who are punishe d by teachers ma y come to f ear
the te acher and tr y to a void scho ol (Gersho ff et al ., 2010). C onse quently , mos t scho ols in the Unite d Sta tes ha ve
banne d corporal punishment . Sec ond , punishment ma y cause children to b ecome more a ggres sive and prone
to antiso cial b ehavior and delinquency (Gersho ff, 2002). The y see their p arents resor t to sp anking when the y
become angr y and fr ustrated, so, in turn , the y ma y act out this same b ehavior when the y become angr y and
frustrated. For e xample , because y ou sp ank Brenda when y ou are angr y with her f or her misb ehavior , she
might s tart hit ting her friends when the y won’t share their to ys.
While p ositiv e punishment c an b e eff ectiv e in some c ases , Skinner sugg ested tha t the use o f punishment
should b e weighe d agains t the p ossible neg ative eff ects . Today’s ps ychologis ts and p arenting e xperts fa vor
reinf orcement o ver punishment —the y rec ommend tha t you c atch y our child doing something g ood and rew ard
them f or it .
Shaping
In his op erant c onditioning e xperiments , Skinner o ften use d an appro ach c alled shaping . Ins tead o f rew arding
only the targ et behavior , inshaping , we rew ard suc cessive appro xima tions o f a targ et behavior . Wh y is shaping
needed? R ememb er tha t in order f or reinf orcement to w ork, the org anism mus t firs t displa y the b ehavior .
Shaping is nee ded because it is e xtremely unlik ely tha t an org anism will displa y an ything but the simples t of
behaviors sp ontaneously . In shaping , behaviors are brok en do wn into man y small , achiev able s teps . The
specific s teps use d in the pro cess are the f ollowing:
1. Reinf orce an y resp onse tha t resembles the desire d behavior .
2. Then reinf orce the resp onse tha t more closely resembles the desire d behavior . You will no long er reinf orce
the previously reinf orced resp onse .
3. Next, begin to reinf orce the resp onse tha t even more closely resembles the desire d behavior .
4. Continue to reinf orce closer and closer appro xima tions o f the desire d behavior .
5. Finally , only reinf orce the desire d behavior .
Shaping is o ften use d in te aching a c omple x behavior or chain o f behaviors . Skinner use d shaping to te ach
pigeons not only such rela tively simple b ehaviors as p ecking a disk in a Skinner b ox, but also man y unusual
and enter taining b ehaviors , such as turning in circles , walking in figure eights , and ev en pla ying ping p ong; the6.3 • Oper ant Conditioning 195
technique is c ommonly use d by animal trainers to day. An imp ortant p art of shaping is s timulus
discrimina tion . Recall P avlov’s dogs —he traine d them to resp ond to the tone o f a b ell, and not to similar tones
or sounds . This discrimina tion is also imp ortant in op erant c onditioning and in shaping b ehavior .

It’s easy to see ho w shaping is eff ectiv e in te aching b ehaviors to animals , but ho w do es shaping w ork with
humans? Let ’s consider p arents whose g oal is to ha ve their child le arn to cle an his ro om. The y use shaping to
help him mas ter s teps to ward the g oal. Ins tead o f performing the entire task , the y set up these s teps and
reinf orce each s tep. First, he cle ans up one to y. Sec ond , he cle ans up fiv e toys. Third , he cho oses whether to
pick up ten to ys or put his b ooks and clothes a way. Fourth, he cle ans up ev erything e xcept tw o toys. Finally , he
cleans his entire ro om.
Primary and Secondary R einf orcers
Rewards such as s tick ers, praise , mone y, toys, and more c an b e use d to reinf orce learning . Let ’s go back to
Skinner ’s rats again. Ho w did the ra ts le arn to pres s the lev er in the Skinner b ox? The y were rew arde d with
food each time the y pres sed the lev er. For animals , food would b e an ob vious reinf orcer.
Wha t would b e a g ood reinf orcer for humans? F or y our child Chris , it w as the promise o f a to y when the y
cleaned their ro om. Ho w about Sy dne y, the so ccer pla yer? If y ou g ave Sy dne y a piec e of candy ev ery time
Sydne y sc ored a g oal, you w ould b e using a primar y reinf orcer. Primar y reinf orcers are reinf orcers tha t ha ve
inna te reinf orcing qualities . These kinds o f reinf orcers are not le arne d. Water, food, sleep , shelter , sex, and
touch , among others , are primar y reinf orcers. Ple asure is also a primar y reinf orcer. Org anisms do not lose
their driv e for these things . For mos t people , jumping in a c ool lak e on a v ery hot da y would b e reinf orcing and
the c ool lak e would b e inna tely reinf orcing—the w ater w ould c ool the p erson o ff (a ph ysical nee d), as w ell as
provide ple asure .
Asecondar y reinf orcerhas no inherent v alue and only has reinf orcing qualities when link ed with a primar y
reinf orcer. Praise , link ed to a ffection , is one e xample o f a sec ondar y reinf orcer, as when y ou c alled out “ Great
shot!” ev ery time Sy dne y made a g oal. Another e xample , mone y, is only w orth something when y ou c an use it
to buy other things —either things tha t satisfy basic nee ds (f ood, water, shelter —all primar y reinf orcers) or
other sec ondar y reinf orcers. If y ou w ere on a remote island in the middle o f the P acific Oc ean and y ou had
stacks o f mone y, the mone y would not b e useful if y ou c ould not sp end it . Wha t about the s tick ers on the
behavior char t? The y also are sec ondar y reinf orcers.
Sometimes , ins tead o f stick ers on a s tick er char t, a tok en is use d. Tokens, which are also sec ondar y
reinf orcers, can then b e trade d in f or rew ards and priz es. Entire b ehavior mana gement s ystems , kno wn as
token ec onomies , are built around the use o f these kinds o f tok en reinf orcers. Token ec onomies ha ve been
found to b e very eff ectiv e at mo difying b ehavior in a v ariety o f set tings such as scho ols, prisons , and mental
hospitals . For e xample , a s tudy b y Adibsereshki and Abk enar (2014) f ound tha t use o f a tok en ec onom y
incre ased appropria te so cial b ehaviors and re duced inappropria te behaviors in a group o f eight grade
students . Similar s tudies sho w demons trable g ains on b ehavior and ac ademic achiev ement f or groups ranging
from firs t grade to high scho ol, and representing a wide arra y of abilities and disa bilities . For e xample , during
studies in volving y oung er students , when children in the s tudy e xhibite d appropria te behavior (not hit ting or
pinching ), the y rec eived a “ quiet hands” tok en. When the y hit or pinche d, the y los t a tok en. The children c ould

Behavior Modification in Childr en
Parents and t eachers o ften use beha vior modification t o chang e a child’ s beha vior. Beha vior modification uses
the principles o f oper ant c onditioning t o ac complish beha vior chang e so that undesir able beha viors ar e switched
for mor e social ly acceptable ones . Some t eachers and par ents cr eate a s ticker char t, in which se veral beha viors
are lis ted (Figure 6.11 ). Stick er char ts ar e a f orm o f token ec onomies , as described in the t ext. Each time childr en
perform the beha vior, the y get a s ticker, and aft er a c ertain number o f stickers, the y get a priz e, or r einforcer. The
goal is t o incr ease ac ceptable beha viors and decr ease misbeha vior. Remember , it is bes t to reinforce desir ed
beha viors , rather than t o use punishment. In the clas sroom, the t eacher can r einforce a wide r ange of beha viors ,
from s tudents r aising their hands , to walking quietl y in the hal l, to turning in their home work. A t home , par ents
might cr eate a beha vior char t that r ewards childr en for things such as put ting a way toys, brushing their t eeth,
and helping with dinner . In or der f or beha vior modification t o be eff ectiv e, the r einforcement needs t o be
connect ed with the beha vior; the r einforcement mus t mat ter to the child and be done c onsis tently.
FIGURE 6.11 Stick er char ts ar e a f orm o f positiv e reinforcement and a t ool f or beha vior modification. Onc e this
child earns a c ertain number o f stickers f or demons trating a desir ed beha vior, she wil l be r ewarded with a trip t o
the ic e cream parlor . (credit: Abig ail Bat chelder)
Time -out is another popular t echnique used in beha vior modification with childr en. It oper ates on the principle o f
negative punishment. When a child demons trates an undesir able beha vior, the y are remo ved fr om the desir able
activity at hand ( Figure 6.12 ). For example , say that Sophia and her br other Mario ar e pla ying with building
block s. Sophia thr ows some block s at her br other , so y ou giv e her a w arning that she wil l go to time -out if she
does it ag ain. A f ew minut es lat er, she thr ows mor e block s at Mario . You remo ve Sophia fr om the r oom f or a f ew
minut es. When she c omes back, she doesn ’t thr ow block s.
Ther e are se veral impor tant points that y ou should kno w if y ou plan t o implement time -out as a beha vior
modification t echnique . Firs t, mak e sur e the child is being r emo ved fr om a desir able activity and plac ed in a les s
desir able location. If the activity is something undesir able f or the child, this t echnique wil l backfir e because it is
mor e enjo yable f or the child t o be r emo ved fr om the activity . Sec ond, the length o f the time -out is impor tant. The
gener al rule o f thumb is one minut e for each y ear o f the child’ s ag e. Sophia is fiv e; ther efore, she sits in a time -
out f or fiv e minut es. Set ting a timer helps childr en kno w ho w long the y ha ve to sit in time -out. Final ly, as a
caregiv er, keep se veral guidelines in mind o ver the c ourse o f a time -out: r emain calm when dir ecting y our child t o
time -out; ignor e your child during time -out (because car egiv er at tention ma y reinforce misbeha vior); and giv e the
child a hug or a kind w ord when time -out is o ver.EVER YDAY CONNECTION6.3 • Oper ant Conditioning 197

Reinf orcement Schedules
Rememb er, the b est way to te ach a p erson or animal a b ehavior is to use p ositiv e reinf orcement . For e xample ,
Skinner use d positiv e reinf orcement to te ach ra ts to pres s a lev er in a Skinner b ox. At firs t, the ra t might
randomly hit the lev er while e xploring the b ox, and out w ould c ome a p ellet o f food. After e ating the p ellet ,
wha t do y ou think the hungr y ra t did ne xt? It hit the lev er a gain, and rec eived another p ellet o f food. Each time
the ra t hit the lev er, a p ellet o f food came out . When an org anism rec eives a reinf orcer e ach time it displa ys a
behavior , it is c alledcontinuous reinf orcement . This reinf orcement sche dule is the quick est way to te ach
someone a b ehavior , and it is esp ecially eff ectiv e in training a new b ehavior . Let ’s look b ack a t the dog tha t was
learning to sit e arlier in the chapter . Now, each time he sits , you giv e him a tre at. Timing is imp ortant here: y ou
will b e mos t suc cessful if y ou present the reinf orcer imme diately a fter he sits , so tha t he c an mak e an

Now let ’s combine these f our terms . Afixed inter val reinf orcement sche dule is when b ehavior is rew arde d

provide prompt and c ourteous ser vice. His pro ductivity reg arding prompt ser vice and k eeping a cle an
restaurant are s teady b ecause he w ants his crew to e arn the b onus .
With a fixed rat io reinf orcement sche dule , there are a set numb er o f resp onses tha t mus t occur b efore the

backup p air, so she c an incre ase her c ommis sion . She do es not c are if the p erson re ally nee ds the prescription
sunglas ses, Carla jus t wants her b onus . The quality o f wha t Carla sells do es not ma tter b ecause her
commis sion is not b ased on quality; it ’s only b ased on the numb er o f pairs sold . This dis tinction in the quality
of performanc e can help determine which reinf orcement metho d is mos t appropria te for a p articular
situa tion . Fixed ra tios are b etter suite d to optimiz e the quantity o f output , where as a fix ed inter val, in which

gambling . Ima gine tha t Sarah— generally a smar t, thrifty w oman— visits Las V egas for the firs t time . She is not a
gambler , but out o f curiosity she puts a quar ter into the slot machine , and then another , and another . Nothing
happ ens. Tw o dollars in quar ters la ter, her curiosity is fading , and she is jus t about to quit . But then , the
machine lights up , bells g o off, and Sarah g ets 50 quar ters b ack. Tha t’s more lik e it! Sarah g ets b ack to
inser ting quar ters with renew ed interes t, and a f ew minutes la ter she has use d up all her g ains and is $10 in
the hole . Now might b e a sensible time to quit . And y et, she k eeps put ting mone y into the slot machine b ecause
she nev er kno ws when the ne xt reinf orcement is c oming . She k eeps thinking tha t with the ne xt quar ter she
could win $50, or $100, or ev en more . Bec ause the reinf orcement sche dule in mos t typ es o f gambling has a
varia ble ra tio sche dule , people k eep tr ying and hoping tha t the ne xt time the y will win big . This is one o f the
reasons tha t gambling is so addictiv e—and so resis tant to e xtinction .
In op erant c onditioning , extinction o f a reinf orced behavior o ccurs a t some p oint a fter reinf orcement s tops ,
and the sp eed at which this happ ens dep ends on the reinf orcement sche dule . In a v aria ble ra tio sche dule , the
point o f extinction c omes v ery slo wly, as describ ed above. But in the other reinf orcement sche dules , extinction
may come quickly . For e xample , if J une pres ses the but ton f or the p ain relief me dication b efore the allot ted
time the do ctor has appro ved, no me dication is adminis tere d. The y are on a fix ed inter val reinf orcement
sche dule (dose d hourly ), so e xtinction o ccurs quickly when reinf orcement do esn’t come a t the e xpecte d time .
Among the reinf orcement sche dules , varia ble ra tio is the mos t pro ductiv e and the mos t resis tant to e xtinction .
Fixed inter val is the le ast pro ductiv e and the e asies t to e xtinguish ( Figure 6.13 ).

A fix ed ratio schedule is pr edictable and pr oduc es a high r esponse r ate, with a shor t pause aft er reinforcement (e .g.,

Gambling and the Br ain
Skinner (1953) s tated, “If the g ambling es tablishment cannot persuade a patr on to turn o ver mone y with no r eturn,
it ma y achie ve the same eff ect b y returning par t of the patr on's mone y on a v ariable -ratio schedule ” (p. 397).
Skinner uses g ambling as an e xample o f the po wer of the v ariable -ratio r einforcement schedule f or maintaining
beha vior e ven during long periods without an y reinforcement. In fact, Skinner w as so c onfident in his kno wledg e of
gambling addiction that he e ven claimed he c ould turn a pig eon int o a pathological g ambler (“ Skinner ’s Utopia ,”
1971). It is indeed true that v ariable -ratio schedules k eep beha vior quit e persis tent—jus t imagine the fr equency o f a
child’ s tantrums if a par ent giv es in e ven onc e to the beha vior. The oc casional r eward mak es it almos t impos sible t o

pathological g ambling (L askowski et al ., 2019). Ho wever, other r esear ch sug gests that g ambling does seem t o work
on the br ain in the same w ay as mos t addictiv e drugs , and so ther e ma y be some c ombination o f brain chemis try
and r einforcement schedule that c ould lead t o problem g ambling ( Figure 6.14 ). Specifical ly, modern r esear ch sho ws
the c onnection betw een g ambling and the activ ation o f the r eward centers o f the br ain that use the
neur otransmit ter (br ain chemical) dopamine (Mur ch & Clark, 2016). Int erestingl y, gamblers don ’t even ha ve to win
to experienc e the “ rush ” of dopamine in the br ain. “Near mis ses,” or almos t winning but not actual ly winning , also
have been sho wn t o incr ease activity in the v entr al striatum and other br ain r eward centers that use dopamine
(Chase & Clark, 2010). These br ain eff ects ar e almos t identical t o those pr oduc ed b y addictiv e drugs lik e cocaine
and her oin (Mur ch & Clark, 2016). Based on the neur oscientific e videnc e sho wing these similarities , the DSM-5 no w
considers g ambling an addiction, while earlier v ersions o f the DSM clas sified g ambling as an impulse c ontr ol
disor der.
FIGURE 6.14 Some r esear ch sug gests that pathological g amblers use g ambling t o compensat e for abnormal ly low
levels o f the hormone nor epinephrine , which is as sociat ed with s tress and is secr eted in moments o f arousal and
thril l. (credit: T ed Murph y)
In addition t o dopamine , gambling also appears t o involve other neur otransmit ters, including nor epinephrine and
serotonin (P otenza , 2013). Nor epinephrine is secr eted when a person f eels s tress, arousal , or thril l. It ma y be that
pathological g amblers use g ambling t o incr ease their le vels o f this neur otransmit ter. Deficiencies in ser otonin might
also c ontribut e to compulsiv e beha vior, including a g ambling addiction (P otenza , 2013).
It ma y be that pathological g amblers’ br ains ar e diff erent than those o f other people , and perhaps this diff erence
may someho w ha ve led t o their g ambling addiction, as these s tudies seem t o sug gest. Ho wever, it is v ery difficul t to
ascertain the cause because it is impos sible t o conduct a true e xperiment (it w ould be unethical t o try to turn
randoml y assigned par ticipants int o problem g amblers). Ther efore, it ma y be that causation actual ly mo ves in the
opposit e dir ection—perhaps the act o f gambling someho w chang es neur otransmit ter le vels in some g amblers’
brains . It also is pos sible that some o verlook ed fact or, or c onfounding v ariable , pla yed a r ole in both the g ambling
addiction and the diff erences in br ain chemis try.
Cognition and Latent Learning
Strict b ehavioris ts lik e Watson and Skinner f ocuse d exclusiv ely on s tudying b ehavior ra ther than c ognition
(such as thoughts and e xpecta tions). In fact , Skinner w as such a s taunch b eliev er tha t cognition didn 't ma tter
that his ide as w ere c onsidere dradic al b eha viorism . Skinner c onsidere d the mind a "black b ox"—something
completely unkno wable—and , theref ore, something not to b e studie d. Ho wever, another b ehavioris t, Edward C .
Tolman , had a diff erent opinion . Tolman ’s experiments with ra ts demons trated tha t org anisms c an le arn ev en
if the y do not rec eive imme diate reinf orcement ( Tolman & Honzik , 1930; T olman , Ritchie , & K alish , 1946). This
finding w as in c onflict with the prev ailing ide a at the time tha t reinf orcement mus t be imme diate in order f or
learning to o ccur, thus sugg esting a c ognitiv e asp ect to le arning .6.3 • Oper ant Conditioning 201
In the e xperiments , Tolman plac ed hungr y ra ts in a maz e with no rew ard f or finding their w ay through it . He
also s tudie d a c omp arison group tha t was rew arde d with f ood at the end o f the maz e. As the unreinf orced ra ts
explore d the maz e, the y dev elop ed acognit ive map : a mental picture o f the la yout o f the maz e (Figure 6.15 ).
After 10 ses sions in the maz e without reinf orcement , food was plac ed in a g oal box at the end o f the maz e. As
soon as the ra ts became a ware o f the f ood, the y were a ble to find their w ay through the maz e quickly , jus t as
quickly as the c omp arison group , which had b een rew arde d with f ood all along . This is kno wn as latent
learning : learning tha t occurs but is not obser vable in b ehavior until there is a re ason to demons trate it .

Latent le arning also o ccurs in humans . Children ma y learn b y watching the actions o f their p arents but only
demons trate it a t a la ter da te, when the le arne d ma terial is nee ded. For e xample , supp ose tha t Ra vi’s dad
driv es him to scho ol ev ery da y. In this w ay, Ravi le arns the route from his house to his scho ol, but he ’s nev er
driv en there himself, so he has not had a chanc e to demons trate tha t he ’s learne d the w ay. One morning Ra vi’s
dad has to le ave early f or a meeting , so he c an’t driv e Ra vi to scho ol. Ins tead, Ravi follows the same route on his
bike tha t his dad w ould ha ve tak en in the c ar. This demons trates la tent le arning . Ravi had le arne d the route to

Whene ver w e go someplac e ne w, we build a mental r epresentation— or cognitiv e map —of the location, as
Tolman ’s rats buil t a c ognitiv e map o f their maz e. Ho wever, some buildings ar e confusing because the y include
man y areas that look alik e or ha ve shor t lines o f sight. Because o f this , it’s often difficul t to predict what ’s around

suggests that what w e plac e in our c ognitiv e map can impact our suc cess in na vigating thr ough the en vironment.
She sug gests that pa ying at tention t o specific f eatur es upon ent ering a building , such as a pictur e on the w all, a

By the end o f this section, y ou wil l be able t o:
•Define obser vational learning
•Discus s the s teps in the modeling pr ocess
•Explain the pr osocial and antisocial eff ects o f obser vational learning
Previous sections o f this chapter f ocuse d on clas sical and op erant c onditioning , which are f orms o f associative
learning . Inobser vational le arning , we learn b y watching others and then imita ting , or mo deling , wha t the y
do or sa y. For ins tanc e, have you ev er g one to Y ouTube to find a video sho wing y ou ho w to do something? The
individuals p erforming the imita ted behavior are c alledmodels . Research sugg ests tha t this imita tive learning
involves a sp ecific typ e of neuron , called a mirror neuron (Hick ock, 2010; Rizz olatti, Fadig a, Fogassi, & G allese ,
2002; Rizz olatti, Fogassi, & G allese , 2006).
Humans and other animals are c apable o f obser vational le arning . For e xample , in a s tudy o f social le arning in
chimp anzees, rese archers g ave juic e boxes with s traws to tw o groups o f captiv e chimp anzees. The firs t group
dipp ed the s traw into the juic e box, and then suck ed on the small amount o f juic e at the end o f the s traw. The
second group suck ed through the s traw directly , getting much more juic e. When the firs t group , the “ dipp ers,”
obser ved the sec ond group , “the suck ers,” wha t do y ou think happ ened? A ll of the “ dipp ers” in the firs t group
switche d to sucking through the s traws directly . By simply obser ving the other chimps and mo deling their
behavior , the y learne d tha t this w as a more efficient metho d of getting juic e (Yamamoto , Humle , and T anaka,
2013).

Like Tolman , whose e xperiments with ra ts sugg ested a c ognitiv e comp onent to le arning , psychologis t Albert
Bandura ’s ide as a bout le arning w ere diff erent from those o f strict b ehavioris ts. Bandura and other rese archers
prop osed a brand o f behaviorism c alled so cial le arning theor y, which to ok c ognitiv e pro cesses into ac count .
According to Bandura , pure b ehaviorism c ould not e xplain wh y learning c an tak e plac e in the a bsenc e of
external reinf orcement . He f elt tha t internal mental s tates mus t also ha ve a role in le arning and tha t
obser vational le arning in volves much more than imita tion . In imita tion , a p erson simply c opies wha t the
model do es. Obser vational le arning is much more c omple x. According to Lefranç ois (2012) there are sev eral
ways tha t obser vational le arning c an o ccur:
1. You le arn a new resp onse . After w atching y our c oworker g et chew ed out b y your b oss for c oming in la te,
you s tart leaving home 10 minutes e arlier so tha t you w on’t be late.
2. You cho ose whether or not to imita te the mo del dep ending on wha t you sa w happ en to the mo del.

not to touch a hot s tove after w atching his fa ther g et burne d on a s tove.
3. You le arn a g eneral r ule tha t you c an apply to other situa tions .
Bandura identifie d three kinds o f mo dels: liv e, verbal, and s ymb olic. A liv e mo del demons trates a b ehavior in
person , as when Ben s tood up on his sur fboard so tha t Julian c ould see ho w he did it . A v erbal ins tructional
model do es not p erform the b ehavior , but ins tead e xplains or describ es the b ehavior , as when a so ccer coach
tells his y oung pla yers to kick the b all with the side o f the f oot, not with the to e. A s ymb olic mo del c an b e

Steps in the Modeling Pr ocess
Of c ourse , we don ’t learn a b ehavior simply b y obser ving a mo del. Bandura describ ed sp ecific s teps in the
process of mo deling tha t mus t be followed if le arning is to b e suc cessful: a ttention , retention , repro duction ,
and motiv ation . First, you mus t be focuse d on wha t the mo del is doing— you ha ve to p ay attention . Next, you
mus t be able to retain , or rememb er, wha t you obser ved; this is retention . Then , you mus t be able to p erform
the b ehavior tha t you obser ved and c ommit ted to memor y; this is repro duction . Finally , you mus t ha ve
motiv ation . You nee d to w ant to c opy the b ehavior , and whether or not y ou are motiv ated dep ends on wha t
happ ened to the mo del. If y ou sa w tha t the mo del w as reinf orced for their b ehavior , you will b e more motiv ated
to copy them . This is kno wn as vicarious reinf orcement . On the other hand , if y ou obser ved the mo del b eing
punishe d, you w ould b e les s motiv ated to c opy them . This is c alledvicarious punishment . For e xample ,
ima gine tha t four-year-old A llison w atche d her older sis ter K aitlyn pla ying in their mother ’s mak eup, and then
saw Kaitlyn g et a time out when their mother c ame in . After their mother left the ro om, Allison w as tempte d to

you actually demons trate the new b ehavior , the reinf orcement y ou rec eive pla ys a p art in whether or not y ou
will rep eat the b ehavior .
Bandura rese arche d mo deling b ehavior , particularly children ’s mo deling o f adults’ a ggres sive and violent

and tos s out the old ada ge “Do as I sa y, not as I do ,” because children tend to c opy wha t you do ins tead o f wha t

Summary
6.1 What Is Learning?
Instincts and refle xes are inna te behaviors —the y occur na turally and do not in volve learning . In c ontras t,
learning is a chang e in b ehavior or kno wledge tha t results from e xperienc e. There are three main typ es o f
learning: clas sical conditioning , operant c onditioning , and obser vational le arning . Both clas sical and op erant
conditioning are f orms o f associative learning where as sociations are made b etween ev ents tha t occur
together . Obser vational le arning is jus t as it sounds: le arning b y obser ving others .
6.2 Classical Conditioning
Pavlov’s pioneering w ork with dogs c ontribute d gre atly to wha t we kno w about le arning . His e xperiments
explore d the typ e of associative learning w e no w call clas sical conditioning . In clas sical conditioning ,
organisms le arn to as sociate ev ents tha t rep eatedly happ en tog ether , and rese archers s tudy ho w a refle xive
resp onse to a s timulus c an b e mapp ed to a diff erent s timulus —by training an as sociation b etween the tw o
stimuli . Pavlov’s experiments sho w ho w stimulus -resp onse b onds are f orme d. Watson , the f ounder o f
behaviorism , was gre atly influenc ed by Pavlov’s work. He tes ted humans b y conditioning f ear in an infant
kno wn as Lit tle A lbert. His findings sugg est tha t clas sical conditioning c an e xplain ho w some f ears dev elop .
6.3 Oper ant Conditioning
Operant c onditioning is b ased on the w ork o f B. F. Skinner . Op erant c onditioning is a f orm o f learning in which
the motiv ation f or a b ehavior happ ens after the b ehavior is demons trated. An animal or a human rec eives a
conse quenc e after p erforming a sp ecific b ehavior . The c onse quenc e is either a reinf orcer or a punisher . All
reinf orcement (p ositiv e or neg ative)incre ases the lik eliho od of a b ehavioral resp onse . All punishment
(positiv e or neg ative)decre ases the lik eliho od of a b ehavioral resp onse . Sev eral typ es o f reinf orcement
sche dules are use d to rew ard b ehavior dep ending on either a set or v aria ble p erio d of time .
6.4 Observ ational Learning (Modeling)
According to Bandura, le arning c an o ccur b y watching others and then mo deling wha t the y do or sa y. This is
kno wn as obser vational le arning . There are sp ecific s teps in the pro cess of mo deling tha t mus t be followed if
learning is to b e suc cessful. These s teps include a ttention , retention , repro duction , and motiv ation . Through
modeling , Bandura has sho wn tha t children le arn man y things b oth g ood and b ad simply b y watching their
parents , siblings , and others .

LEARNING OBJEC TIVES
By the end o f this section, y ou wil l be able t o:
•Describe c ognition
•Distinguish c oncepts and pr ototypes
•Explain the diff erence betw een natur al and ar tificial c oncepts
•Describe ho w schemata ar e organiz ed and c onstruct ed
Ima gine all o f your thoughts as if the y were ph ysical entities , swirling rapidly inside y our mind . Ho w is it
possible tha t the brain is a ble to mo ve from one thought to the ne xt in an org aniz ed, orderly fashion? The brain
is endles sly p erceiving , pro cessing , planning , org anizing , and rememb ering—it is alw ays activ e. Yet, you don ’t
notic e mos t of your brain ’s activity as y ou mo ve throughout y our daily routine . This is only one fac et of the
comple x pro cesses in volved in c ognition . Simply put ,cognit ion is thinking , and it enc omp asses the pro cesses
associated with p erception , kno wledge, problem solving , judgment , langua ge, and memor y. Scientis ts who
study c ognition are se arching f or w ays to unders tand ho w w e integra te, org aniz e, and utiliz e our c onscious
cognitiv e experienc es without b eing a ware o f all o f the unc onscious w ork tha t our brains are doing (f or
example , Kahneman , 2011).
Cognition
Upon w aking e ach morning , you b egin thinking— contempla ting the tasks tha t you mus t complete tha t day. In
wha t order should y ou r un y our errands? Should y ou g o to the b ank , the cle aners , or the gro cery store firs t?
Can y ou g et these things done b efore y ou he ad to clas s or will the y nee d to w ait until scho ol is done? These
thoughts are one e xample o f cognition a t work. Exceptionally c omple x, cognition is an es sential f eature o f
human c onsciousnes s, yet not all asp ects o f cognition are c onsciously e xperienc ed.
Cognit ive psy cholog yis the field o f psycholog y de dicated to e xamining ho w people think . It a ttempts to
explain ho w and wh y we think the w ay we do b y studying the interactions among human thinking , emotion ,
creativity , langua ge, and problem solving , in addition to other c ognitiv e pro cesses. Cognitiv e ps ychologis ts
strive to determine and me asure diff erent typ es o f intellig ence, wh y some p eople are b etter a t problem solving
than others , and ho w emotional intellig ence affects suc cess in the w orkplac e, among c ountles s other topics .
The y also sometimes f ocus on ho w w e org aniz e thoughts and inf orma tion g athere d from our en vironments
into me aningful c ategories o f thought , which will b e discus sed later.
Concepts and Pr ototypes
The human ner vous s ystem is c apable o f handling endles s streams o f inf orma tion . The senses ser ve as the
inter face between the mind and the e xternal en vironment , rec eiving s timuli and transla ting it into ner vous
impulses tha t are transmit ted to the brain . The brain then pro cesses this inf orma tion and uses the relev ant
piec es to cre ate thoughts , which c an then b e expres sed through langua ge or s tore d in memor y for future use .
To mak e this pro cess more c omple x, the brain do es not g ather inf orma tion from e xternal en vironments only .
When thoughts are f orme d, the mind s ynthesiz es inf orma tion from emotions and memories ( Figure 7.2 ).
Emotion and memor y are p owerful influenc es on b oth our thoughts and b ehaviors .214 7 • Thinking and Int elligence
Access for fr ee a t opens tax. org
FIGURE 7.2Sensations and inf ormation ar e received b y our br ains , filtered thr ough emotions and memories , and
processed t o bec ome thoughts .
In order to org aniz e this s taggering amount o f inf orma tion , the mind has dev elop ed a "file c abinet " of sor ts in
the mind . The diff erent files s tore d in the file c abinet are c alled concepts .Conc epts are c ategories or groupings
of linguis tic inf orma tion , ima ges, ide as, or memories , such as lif e experienc es. Concepts are , in man y ways, big
ideas tha t are g enera ted by obser ving details , and c ategorizing and c ombining these details into c ognitiv e
structures . You use c oncepts to see the rela tionships among the diff erent elements o f your e xperienc es and to
keep the inf orma tion in y our mind org aniz ed and ac cessible .
Concepts are inf orme d by our semantic memor y (you will le arn more a bout semantic memor y in a la ter
chapter) and are present in ev ery asp ect o f our liv es; ho wever, one o f the e asies t plac es to notic e concepts is
inside a clas sroom, where the y are discus sed explicitly . When y ou s tudy Unite d Sta tes his tory, for e xample , you
learn a bout more than jus t individual ev ents tha t ha ve happ ened in Americ a’s past. You a bsorb a larg e quantity
of inf orma tion b y lis tening to and p articip ating in discus sions , examining maps , and re ading firs t-hand
accounts o f people ’s liv es. Your brain analyz es these details and dev elops an o verall unders tanding o f
Americ an his tory. In the pro cess, your brain g athers details tha t inf orm and refine y our unders tanding o f
rela ted concepts lik e demo cracy , power, and free dom .
Concepts c an b e comple x and a bstract , like jus tice, or more c oncrete , like typ es o f birds . In ps ycholog y, for
example , Pia get’s stages o f dev elopment are a bstract c oncepts . Some c oncepts , like toleranc e, are a gree d up on
by man y people , because the y ha ve been use d in v arious w ays over man y years. Other c oncepts , like the
characteris tics o f your ide al friend or y our family ’s bir thda y traditions , are p ersonal and individualiz ed. In this
way, concepts touch ev ery asp ect o f our liv es, from our man y daily routines to the guiding principles b ehind
the w ay governments function .
Another technique use d by your brain to org aniz e inf orma tion is the identific ation o f prototyp es for the
concepts y ou ha ve dev elop ed. Aprotot ypeis the b est example or representa tion o f a c oncept. For e xample ,
wha t comes to y our mind when y ou think o f a dog? Mos t lik ely y our e arly e xperienc es with dogs will shap e
wha t you ima gine . If y our firs t pet w as a Golden R etriev er, there is a g ood chanc e tha t this w ould b e your
prototyp e for the c ategory of dogs .
Natur al and Artificial Concepts
In ps ycholog y, concepts c an b e divide d into tw o categories , natural and ar tificial .Natural c onc epts are cre ated
“naturally ” through y our e xperienc es and c an b e dev elop ed from either direct or indirect e xperienc es. For
example , if y ou liv e in Es sex Junction , Vermont , you ha ve prob ably had a lot o f direct e xperienc e with sno w.
You’ve watche d it fall from the sky , you’ve seen lightly falling sno w tha t barely c overs the windshield o f your
car, and y ou’ve sho veled out 18 inches o f fluff y white sno w as y ou’ve thought , “This is p erfect f or skiing .”7.1 • Wha t Is Cognition? 215
You’ve thro wn sno wballs a t your b est friend and g one sle dding do wn the s teep est hill in to wn. In shor t, you
kno w sno w. You kno w wha t it lo oks lik e, smells lik e, tas tes lik e, and f eels lik e. If, ho wever, you’ve liv ed your
whole lif e on the island o f Saint V incent in the C aribb ean, you ma y nev er ha ve actually seen sno w, much les s
tasted, smelle d, or touche d it. You kno w sno w from the indirect e xperienc e of seeing pictures o f falling
snow—or from w atching films tha t feature sno w as p art of the set ting . Either w ay, sno w is a na tural c oncept
because y ou c an c onstruct an unders tanding o f it through direct obser vations , experienc es with sno w, or
indirect kno wledge (such as from films or b ooks) ( Figure 7.3 ).
FIGURE 7.3(a) Our c oncept of sno w is an e xample o f a natur al concept—one that w e unders tand thr ough dir ect
obser vation and e xperienc e. (b) In c ontr ast, artificial c oncepts ar e ones that w e kno w by a specific set o f
char acteristics that the y always exhibit, such as what defines diff erent basic shapes . (credit a: modification o f work

Anartificial c onc ept, on the other hand , is a c oncept tha t is define d by a sp ecific set o f characteris tics. Various
prop erties o f geometric shap es, like squares and triangles , ser ve as useful e xamples o f artificial c oncepts . A
triangle alw ays has three angles and three sides . A square alw ays has f our e qual sides and f our right angles .
Mathema tical formulas , like the e qua tion f or are a (length × width) are ar tificial c oncepts define d by sp ecific
sets o f characteris tics tha t are alw ays the same . Artificial c oncepts c an enhanc e the unders tanding o f a topic
by building on one another . For e xample , before le arning the c oncept o f “area of a square ” (and the f ormula to
find it), y ou mus t unders tand wha t a square is . Onc e the c oncept o f “area of a square ” is unders tood, an
unders tanding o f are a for other g eometric shap es c an b e built up on the original unders tanding o f are a. The
use o f artificial c oncepts to define an ide a is cr ucial to c ommunic ating with others and eng aging in c omple x
thought . According to Golds tone and K ersten (2003), c oncepts act as building blo cks and c an b e connecte d in
countles s combina tions to cre ate comple x thoughts .
Schemata
Aschema is a mental c onstruct c onsis ting o f a clus ter or c ollection o f rela ted concepts (Bar tlett, 1932). There
are man y diff erent typ es o f schema ta, and the y all ha ve one thing in c ommon: schema ta are a metho d of
organizing inf orma tion tha t allo ws the brain to w ork more efficiently . When a schema is activ ated, the brain
mak es imme diate as sumptions a bout the p erson or object b eing obser ved.
There are sev eral typ es o f schema ta. A role schema mak es as sumptions a bout ho w individuals in c ertain roles
will b ehave (Callero , 1994). F or e xample , ima gine y ou meet someone who intro duces himself as a firefighter .
When this happ ens, your brain a utoma tically activ ates the “firefighter schema ” and b egins making
assumptions tha t this p erson is bra ve, selfles s, and c ommunity -oriente d. Despite not kno wing this p erson ,
alre ady y ou ha ve unkno wingly made judgments a bout them . Schema ta also help y ou fill in g aps in the
informa tion y ou rec eive from the w orld around y ou. While schema ta allo w for more efficient inf orma tion
processing , there c an b e problems with schema ta, reg ardles s of whether the y are ac cura te: P erhaps this
particular firefighter is not bra ve, the y jus t work as a firefighter to p ay the bills while s tudying to b ecome a
children ’s librarian .216 7 • Thinking and Int elligence

Anevent schema , also kno wn as a cognit ive script , is a set o f behaviors tha t can f eel lik e a routine . Think
about wha t you do when y ou w alk into an elev ator ( Figure 7.4 ). First, the do ors op en and y ou w ait to let e xiting
passeng ers le ave the elev ator c ar. Then , you s tep into the elev ator and turn around to fac e the do ors, looking
for the c orrect but ton to push . You nev er fac e the b ack o f the elev ator, do y ou? And when y ou’re riding in a
crowded elev ator and y ou c an’t fac e the front , it feels unc omf ortable, doesn’t it? Interes tingly , event schema ta
can v ary widely among diff erent cultures and c ountries . For e xample , while it is quite c ommon f or p eople to
greet one another with a handshak e in the Unite d Sta tes, in Tib et, you greet someone b y sticking y our tongue

Langua geis a c ommunic ation s ystem tha t involves using w ords and s ystema tic r ules to org aniz e those w ords
to transmit inf orma tion from one individual to another . While langua ge is a f orm o f communic ation , not all
communic ation is langua ge. Man y sp ecies c ommunic ate with one another through their p ostures , mo vements ,
odors , or v ocaliza tions . This c ommunic ation is cr ucial f or sp ecies tha t nee d to interact and dev elop so cial
rela tionships with their c onsp ecifics . Ho wever, man y people ha ve as serted tha t it is langua ge tha t mak es
humans unique among all o f the animal sp ecies (C orballis & Suddendor f, 2007; T omasello & Rak oczy, 2003).
This section will f ocus on wha t dis tinguishes langua ge as a sp ecial f orm o f communic ation , how the use o f
langua ge dev elops , and ho w langua ge affects the w ay we think .
Components of Language
Langua ge, be it sp oken, signe d, or writ ten, has sp ecific c omp onents: a le xicon and grammar .Lexiconrefers to
the w ords o f a giv en langua ge. Thus , lexicon is a langua ge’s vocabular y.Grammar refers to the set o f rules tha t
are use d to c onvey me aning through the use o f the le xicon (F ernánde z & C airns , 2011). F or ins tanc e, English
grammar dicta tes tha t mos t verbs rec eive an “-e d” at the end to indic ate p ast tense .
Words are f orme d by combining the v arious phonemes tha t mak e up the langua ge. Aphoneme (e.g., the
sounds “ ah” vs. “eh”) is a b asic sound unit o f a giv en langua ge, and diff erent langua ges ha ve diff erent sets o f
phonemes . Phonemes are c ombine d to f orm morphemes , which are the smalles t units o f langua ge tha t convey
some typ e of me aning (e .g., “I” is b oth a phoneme and a morpheme). W e use semantics and s yntax to c onstruct
langua ge. Semantics and s yntax are p art of a langua ge’s grammar .Semant icsrefers to the pro cess by which
we deriv e me aning from morphemes and w ords .Syntax refers to the w ay words are org aniz ed into sentenc es
(Chomsky , 1965; F ernánde z & C airns , 2011).
We apply the r ules o f grammar to org aniz e the le xicon in no vel and cre ative ways, which allo w us to
communic ate inf orma tion a bout b oth c oncrete and a bstract c oncepts . We can talk a bout our imme diate and
obser vable surroundings as w ell as the sur face of unseen planets . We can share our innermos t thoughts , our
plans f or the future , and deb ate the v alue o f a c olleg e educ ation . We can pro vide detaile d ins tructions f or
cooking a me al, fixing a c ar, or building a fire . Through our use o f words and langua ge, we are a ble to f orm ,
organiz e, and e xpres s ide as, schema, and ar tificial c oncepts .
Language Development
Given the remarka ble c omple xity o f a langua ge, one might e xpect tha t mas tering a langua ge would b e an
especially arduous task; indee d, for those o f us tr ying to le arn a sec ond langua ge as adults , this might seem to
be true. Ho wever, young children mas ter langua ge very quickly with rela tive ease. B. F.Skinner (1957)
prop osed tha t langua ge is le arne d through reinf orcement . NoamChomsky (1965) criticiz ed this b ehavioris t
appro ach, asserting ins tead tha t the mechanisms underlying langua ge ac quisition are biologic ally
determine d. The use o f langua ge dev elops in the a bsenc e of formal ins truction and app ears to f ollow a v ery
similar p attern in children from v astly diff erent cultures and b ackgrounds . It w ould seem , theref ore, tha t we
are b orn with a biologic al pre disp osition to ac quire a langua ge (Chomsky , 1965; F ernánde z & C airns , 2011).
Moreo ver, it app ears tha t there is a critic al perio d for langua ge ac quisition , such tha t this pro ficiency a t
acquiring langua ge is maximal e arly in lif e; generally , as p eople a ge, the e ase with which the y ac quire and
mas ter new langua ges diminishes (J ohnson & N ewp ort, 1989; Lenneb erg, 1967; Singleton , 1995).
Children b egin to le arn a bout langua ge from a v ery early a ge (Table 7.1 ). In fact , it app ears tha t this is218 7 • Thinking and Int elligence

The Case of Genie
In the fal l of 1970, a social w orker in the L os Ang eles ar ea found a 13- year-old girl who w as being r aised in
extremel y neglect ful and abusiv e conditions . The girl , who came t o be kno wn as Genie , had liv ed mos t of her lif e
tied t o a pot ty chair or c onfined t o a crib in a smal l room that w as kept closed with the cur tains dr awn. F or a lit tle
over a decade , Genie had vir tually no social int eraction and no ac cess to the outside w orld. As a r esul t of these
conditions , Genie w as unable t o stand up , che w solid f ood, or speak (F romkin, K rashen, Cur tiss, Rigler , & Rigler ,
1974; R ymer , 1993). The polic e took Genie int o protectiv e cus tody.
Genie ’s abilities impr oved dr amatical ly following her r emo val from her abusiv e en vironment, and earl y on, it
appear ed she w as ac quiring lang uage—much lat er than w ould be pr edict ed b y critical period h ypotheses that
had been posit ed at the time (F romkin et al ., 1974). Genie manag ed to amas s an impr essive vocabular y in a
relativ ely shor t amount o f time . Ho wever, she ne ver de veloped a mas tery of the gr ammatical aspects o f lang uage
(Cur tiss, 1981). P erhaps being depriv ed o f the oppor tunity t o learn lang uage during a critical period impeded
Genie ’s ability t o ful ly acquire and use lang uage.
You ma y rec all tha t each langua ge has its o wn set o f phonemes tha t are use d to g enera te morphemes , words ,
and so on . Babies c an discrimina te among the sounds tha t mak e up a langua ge (for e xample , the y can tell the
differenc e between the “ s” in vision and the “ ss” in fis sion); e arly on , the y can diff erentia te between the sounds
of all human langua ges, even those tha t do not o ccur in the langua ges tha t are use d in their en vironments .
However, by the time tha t the y are a bout 1 y ear old , the y can only discrimina te among those phonemes tha t are
used in the langua ge or langua ges in their en vironments (J ensen , 2011; W erker & Lalonde , 1988; W erker &
Tees, 1984).DIG DEEPER7.2 • L anguage219

Watch this video a bout ho w babies lose the a bility to discrimina te among all p ossible human phonemes as the y
age(http://openstax.org/l/langua ge)to le arn more .
After the firs t few months o f life, babies enter wha t is kno wn as the b abbling s tage, during which time the y tend
to pro duce single s yllables tha t are rep eated over and o ver. As time p asses, more v aria tions app ear in the
syllables tha t the y pro duce. During this time , it is unlik ely tha t the b abies are tr ying to c ommunic ate; the y are
just as lik ely to b abble when the y are alone as when the y are with their c aregiv ers (F ernánde z & C airns , 2011).
Interes tingly , babies who are raise d in en vironments in which sign langua ge is use d will also b egin to sho w
babbling in the g estures o f their hands during this s tage (Petitto, Holo wka, Sergio , Lev y, & Os try, 2004).
Generally , a child ’s firs t word is ut tere d sometime b etween the a ges o f 1 y ear to 18 months , and f or the ne xt few
months , the child will remain in the “ one w ord” stage of langua ge dev elopment . During this time , children
kno w a numb er o f words , but the y only pro duce one -word ut teranc es. The child ’s early v ocabular y is limite d to
familiar objects or ev ents , often nouns . Although children in this s tage only mak e one -word ut teranc es, these
words o ften c arry larg er me aning (F ernánde z & C airns , 2011). So , for e xample , a child sa ying “ cookie ” could b e
identif ying a c ookie or asking f or a c ookie .
As a child ’s lexicon gro ws, the y begin to ut ter simple sentenc es and to ac quire new v ocabular y at a v ery rapid
pace. In addition , children b egin to demons trate a cle ar unders tanding o f the sp ecific r ules tha t apply to their
langua ge(s). E ven the mis takes tha t children sometimes mak e pro vide evidenc e of jus t ho w much the y
unders tand a bout those r ules . This is sometimes seen in the f orm o fovergeneralizat ion. In this c onte xt,
overgeneraliza tion ref ers to an e xtension o f a langua ge rule to an e xception to the r ule. For e xample , in
English , it is usually the c ase tha t an “ s” is adde d to the end o f a w ord to indic ate plurality . For e xample , we
speak o f one dog v ersus tw o dogs . Young children will o vergeneraliz e this r ule to c ases tha t are e xceptions to
the “ add an s to the end o f the w ord” rule and sa y things lik e “those tw o gooses” or “ three mouses .” Cle arly , the
rules o f the langua ge are unders tood, even if the e xceptions to the r ules are s till b eing le arne d (Mosk owitz,
1978).
Language and Thought
When w e sp eak one langua ge, we agree tha t words are representa tions o f ide as, people , plac es, and ev ents . The
given langua ge tha t children le arn is c onnecte d to their culture and surroundings . But can w ords themselv es
shap e the w ay we think a bout things? P sychologis ts ha ve long in vestigated the ques tion o f whether langua ge
shap es thoughts and actions , or whether our thoughts and b eliefs shap e our langua ge. Tw o rese archers ,
Edward Sapir and Benjamin Lee Whor f, began this in vestigation in the 1940s . The y wante d to unders tand ho w
the langua ge ha bits o f a c ommunity enc oura ge memb ers o f tha t community to interpret langua ge in a
particular manner (Sapir , 1941/1964). Sapir and Whor f prop osed tha t langua ge determines thought . For
example , in some langua ges there are man y diff erent w ords f or lo ve. Ho wever, in English w e use the w ord lo ve
for all typ es o f love. Do es this a ffect ho w w e think a bout lo ve dep ending on the langua ge tha t we sp eak (Whor f,
1956)? R esearchers ha ve sinc e identifie d this view as to o absolute , pointing out a lack o f empiricism b ehind
wha t Sapir and Whor f prop osed (Abler , 2013; Boro ditsky , 2011; v an T royer, 1994). T oday, psychologis ts
continue to s tudy and deb ate the rela tionship b etween langua ge and thought .
The Meaning of Language
Think about what y ou kno w of other lang uages; perhaps y ou e ven speak mul tiple lang uages. Imagine f or a

from their original lang uage int o English. F or example , the P ortuguese w ordsaudade originat ed during the 15th
centur y, when P ortuguese sailors left home t o explor e the seas and tr avel to Africa or Asia . Those left behind
described the emp tines s and f ondnes s the y felt as saudade (Figure 7.6 ).The w ord came t o express man y
meanings , including los s, nos talgia , yearning , warm memories , and hope . Ther e is no single w ord in English that
includes al l of those emotions in a single descrip tion. Do w ords such as saudade indicat e that diff erent lang uages
produc e diff erent pat terns o f thought in people? What do y ou think??
FIGURE 7.6These tw o works of art depict saudade . (a) Saudade de Nápoles , which is tr anslat ed int o “missing
Naples ,” was paint ed b y Ber tha W orms in 1895. (b) Almeida Júnior paint edSaudade in 1899.
Langua ge ma y indee d influenc e the w ay tha t we think , an ide a kno wn as linguis tic determinism . One rec ent
demons tration o f this phenomenon in volved diff erenc es in the w ay tha t English and Mandarin Chinese
speakers talk and think a bout time . English sp eakers tend to talk a bout time using terms tha t describ e
chang es along a horiz ontal dimension , for e xample , saying something lik e “I’ m running b ehind sche dule ” or
“Don ’t get ahe ad o f yourself. ” While Mandarin Chinese sp eakers also describ e time in horiz ontal terms , it is not
unc ommon to also use terms as sociated with a v ertical arrang ement . For e xample , the p ast might b e describ ed
as b eing “up ” and the future as b eing “ down.” It turns out tha t these diff erenc es in langua ge transla te into
differenc es in p erformanc e on c ognitiv e tes ts designe d to me asure ho w quickly an individual c an rec ogniz e
temp oral rela tionships . Specific ally, when giv en a series o f tasks with v ertical priming , Mandarin Chinese
speakers w ere fas ter a t rec ognizing temp oral rela tionships b etween months . Indee d, Boro ditsky (2001) sees
these results as sugg esting tha t “ha bits in langua ge enc oura ge ha bits in thought ” (p. 12).
One group o f rese archers who w ante d to in vestigate ho w langua ge influenc es thought c omp ared ho w English

People fac e problems ev ery da y—usually , multiple problems throughout the da y. Sometimes these problems
are s traightf orward: T o double a recip e for pizza dough , for e xample , all tha t is re quire d is tha t each ingre dient
in the recip e be double d. Sometimes , however, the problems w e enc ounter are more c omple x. For e xample ,
say you ha ve a w ork de adline , and y ou mus t mail a printe d copy of a rep ort to y our sup ervisor b y the end o f the
busines s da y. The rep ort is time -sensitiv e and mus t be sent o vernight . You finishe d the rep ort las t night , but
your printer will not w ork to day. Wha t should y ou do? F irst, you nee d to identif y the problem and then apply a
strategy for solving the problem .
Problem-Solving Str ategies
When y ou are presente d with a problem—whether it is a c omple x ma thema tical problem or a brok en printer ,
how do y ou solv e it? Bef ore finding a solution to the problem , the problem mus t firs t be cle arly identifie d. After
that, one o f man y problem solving s trategies c an b e applie d, hop efully resulting in a solution .
Aproblem-solving s trateg yis a plan o f action use d to find a solution . Diff erent s trategies ha ve diff erent action
plans as sociated with them ( Table 7.2 ). For e xample , a w ell-kno wn s trategy is trial and error . The old ada ge,
“If a t firs t you don ’t suc ceed, try, try again” describ es trial and error . In terms o f your brok en printer , you c ould
try checking the ink lev els, and if tha t do esn’t work, you c ould check to mak e sure the p aper tra y isn ’t jamme d.
Or ma ybe the printer isn ’t actually c onnecte d to y our laptop . When using trial and error , you w ould c ontinue to
try diff erent solutions until y ou solv ed your problem . Although trial and error is not typic ally one o f the mos t
time -efficient s trategies , it is a c ommonly use d one .

Another typ e of strategy is an alg orithm . An algorithm is a problem-solving f ormula tha t pro vides y ou with
step-by-step ins tructions use d to achiev e a desire d outc ome (K ahneman , 2011). Y ou c an think o f an alg orithm
as a recip e with highly detaile d ins tructions tha t pro duce the same result ev ery time the y are p erforme d.
Algorithms are use d fre quently in our ev eryday liv es, esp ecially in c omputer scienc e. When y ou r un a se arch
on the Internet , search engines lik e Go ogle use alg orithms to decide which entries will app ear firs t in y our lis t

other situa tions in which alg orithms are use d?222 7 • Thinking and Int elligence
Access for fr ee a t opens tax. org
A heuris tic is another typ e of problem solving s trategy. While an alg orithm mus t be followed exactly to pro duce
a correct result , aheuris ticis a g eneral problem-solving framew ork ( Tversky & K ahneman , 1974). Y ou c an
think o f these as mental shor tcuts tha t are use d to solv e problems . A “r ule o f thumb ” is an e xample o f a
heuris tic. Such a r ule sa ves the p erson time and energ y when making a decision , but despite its time -saving
characteris tics, it is not alw ays the b est metho d for making a ra tional decision . Diff erent typ es o f heuris tics are
used in diff erent typ es o f situa tions , but the impulse to use a heuris tic o ccurs when one o f five conditions is
met (P ratkanis , 1989):
•When one is fac ed with to o much inf orma tion
•When the time to mak e a decision is limite d
•When the decision to b e made is unimp ortant
•When there is ac cess to v ery little inf orma tion to use in making the decision
•When an appropria te heuris tic happ ens to c ome to mind in the same moment
Working b ackw ards is a useful heuris tic in which y ou b egin solving the problem b y focusing on the end
result . Consider this e xample: Y ou liv e in W ashington , D.C. and ha ve been in vite d to a w edding a t 4 PM on
Saturda y in Philadelphia. K nowing tha t Inters tate 95 tends to b ack up an y da y of the w eek, you nee d to plan
your route and time y our dep arture ac cordingly . If y ou w ant to b e at the w edding ser vice by 3:30 PM, and it
takes 2.5 hours to g et to Philadelphia without tra ffic, wha t time should y ou le ave your house? Y ou use the
working b ackw ards heuris tic to plan the ev ents o f your da y on a regular b asis , prob ably without ev en thinking
about it .
Another useful heuris tic is the practic e of accomplishing a larg e goal or task b y bre aking it into a series o f
smaller s teps . Students o ften use this c ommon metho d to c omplete a larg e rese arch project or long es say for
scho ol. For e xample , students typic ally brains torm , dev elop a thesis or main topic , rese arch the chosen topic ,
organiz e their inf orma tion into an outline , write a rough dra ft, revise and e dit the rough dra ft, dev elop a final
draft, org aniz e the ref erenc es lis t, and pro ofread their w ork b efore turning in the project . The larg e task
becomes les s overwhelming when it is brok en do wn into a series o f small s teps .

Pitf alls to Pr oblem Solving
Not all problems are suc cessfully solv ed, however. Wha t challeng es stop us from suc cessfully solving a
problem? Ima gine a p erson in a ro om tha t has f our do orways. One do orway tha t has alw ays been op en in the
past is no w lo cked. The p erson , accustome d to e xiting the ro om b y tha t particular do orway, keeps tr ying to g et
out through the same do orway ev en though the other three do orways are op en. The p erson is s tuck —but the y
just nee d to g o to another do orway, ins tead o f trying to g et out through the lo cked do orway. Amental set is
where y ou p ersis t in appro aching a problem in a w ay tha t has w orked in the p ast but is cle arly not w orking

Researchers ha ve investigated whether functional fix ednes s is a ffecte d by culture . In one e xperiment ,
individuals from the Shuar group in E cuador w ere ask ed to use an object f or a purp ose other than tha t for
which the object w as originally intende d. For e xample , the p articip ants w ere told a s tory about a b ear and a

erasers , and so on , to help the animals . The sp oon w as the only object long enough to sp an the ima ginar y riv er,
but if the sp oon w as presente d in a w ay tha t reflecte d its normal usa ge, it to ok p articip ants long er to cho ose
the sp oon to solv e the problem . (German & Barret t, 2005). The rese archers w ante d to kno w if e xposure to

In order to mak e good decisions , we use our kno wledge and our re asoning . Often , this kno wledge and
reasoning is sound and solid . Sometimes , however, we are s wayed by biases or b y others manipula ting a
situa tion . For e xample , let’s sa y you and three friends w ante d to rent a house and had a c ombine d targ et
budg et of $1,600. The re altor sho ws you only v ery run-do wn houses f or $1,600 and then sho ws you a v ery nic e
house f or $2,000. Might y ou ask e ach p erson to p ay more in rent to g et the $2,000 home? Wh y would the
realtor sho w you the r un-do wn houses and the nic e house? The re altor ma y be challenging y our anchoring
bias . An anchoring bias occurs when y ou f ocus on one piec e of inf orma tion when making a decision or solving
a problem . In this c ase, you’re so f ocuse d on the amount o f mone y you are willing to sp end tha t you ma y not
recogniz e wha t kinds o f houses are a vailable a t tha t pric e point .
The confirmat ion bias is the tendency to f ocus on inf orma tion tha t confirms y our e xisting b eliefs . For

A four-and-a-half -year-old b oy sits a t the kitchen ta ble with his fa ther , who is re ading a new s tory aloud to him .
He turns the p age to c ontinue re ading , but b efore he c an b egin , the b oy sa ys, “Wait, Daddy!” He p oints to the

This fa ther w as not activ ely te aching his son to re ad, even though the child c onstantly ask ed ques tions a bout

intellig ence and ho w it c an b e me asure d.
Classifying Intelligence
Wha t exactly is intellig ence? The w ay tha t rese archers ha ve define d the c oncept o f intellig ence has b een
modifie d man y times sinc e the bir th o f psycholog y. British ps ychologis t Charles S pearman b eliev ed
intellig ence consis ted of one g eneral factor , calledg, which c ould b e me asure d and c omp ared among
individuals . Spearman f ocuse d on the c ommonalities among v arious intellectual a bilities and de -emphasiz ed
wha t made e ach unique . Long b efore mo dern ps ycholog y dev elop ed, however, ancient philosophers , such as
Aris totle , held a similar view (Cianciolo & Sternb erg, 2004).
Others ps ychologis ts believ e tha t ins tead o f a single factor , intellig ence is a c ollection o f dis tinct a bilities . In the
1940s , Raymond C attell prop osed a theor y of intellig ence tha t divide d general intellig ence into tw o
comp onents: cr ystalliz ed intellig ence and fluid intellig ence (Cattell, 1963). Crystalliz ed intellig enc eis
characteriz ed as ac quire d kno wledge and the a bility to retriev e it. When y ou le arn, rememb er, and rec all
informa tion , you are using cr ystalliz ed intellig ence. You use cr ystalliz ed intellig ence all the time in y our
coursew ork b y demons trating tha t you ha ve mas tere d the inf orma tion c overed in the c ourse .Fluid
intellig enc eencomp asses the a bility to see c omple x rela tionships and solv e problems . Navigating y our w ay
home a fter b eing detoure d onto an unfamiliar route b ecause o f road c onstruction w ould dra w up on y our fluid
intellig ence. Fluid intellig ence helps y ou tackle c omple x, abstract challeng es in y our daily lif e, where as
crystalliz ed intellig ence helps y ou o vercome c oncrete , straightf orward problems (C attell, 1963).
Other theoris ts and ps ychologis ts believ e tha t intellig ence should b e define d in more practic al terms . For
example , wha t typ es o f behaviors help y ou g et ahe ad in lif e? Which skills promote suc cess? Think a bout this
for a moment . Being a ble to recite all 45 presidents o f the Unite d Sta tes in order is an e xcellent p arty trick , but
will kno wing this mak e you a b etter p erson?
Robert Sternb erg dev elop ed another theor y of intellig ence, which he title d the triarchic theor y of intellig enc e
because it sees intellig ence as c omprise d of three p arts (Sternb erg, 1988): practic al, cre ative, and analytic al
intellig ence (Figure 7.12 ).228 7 • Thinking and Int elligence
Access for fr ee a t opens tax. org
FIGURE 7.12 Sternber g’s theor y identifies thr ee types o f intelligence: pr actical , creativ e, and anal ytical .
Pract ical intellig enc e, as prop osed by Sternb erg, is sometimes c omp ared to “ street smar ts.” Being practic al
means y ou find solutions tha t work in y our ev eryday life by applying kno wledge based on y our e xperienc es.
This typ e of intellig ence app ears to b e sep arate from traditional unders tanding o f IQ; individuals who sc ore
high in practic al intellig ence ma y or ma y not ha ve comp arable sc ores in cre ative and analytic al intellig ence
(Sternb erg, 1988).
Analyt ical intellig enc eis closely aligne d with ac ademic problem solving and c omputa tions . Sternb erg sa ys
that analytic al intellig ence is demons trated by an a bility to analyz e, evalua te, judg e, comp are, and c ontras t.
When re ading a clas sic no vel for litera ture clas s, for e xample , it is usually nec essary to c omp are the motiv es o f
the main characters o f the b ook or analyz e the his toric al conte xt of the s tory. In a scienc e course such as
anatom y, you mus t study the pro cesses b y which the b ody uses v arious minerals in diff erent human s ystems .
In dev eloping an unders tanding o f this topic , you are using analytic al intellig ence. When solving a challenging
math problem , you w ould apply analytic al intellig ence to analyz e diff erent asp ects o f the problem and then
solv e it section b y section .
Creative intellig enc eis mark ed by inventing or ima gining a solution to a problem or situa tion . Creativity in
this re alm c an include finding a no vel solution to an une xpecte d problem or pro ducing a b eautiful w ork o f art
or a w ell-dev elop ed shor t story. Ima gine f or a moment tha t you are c amping in the w oods with some friends

Mult iple Intellig enc es T heor ywas dev elop ed by Ho ward G ardner , a Har vard ps ychologis t and f ormer s tudent
of Erik Erikson . In G ardner ’s theor y, each p erson p ossesses a t least eight intellig ences. The eight intellig ences
are linguis tic intellig ence, logic al-ma thema tical intellig ence, music al intellig ence, bodily kines thetic
intellig ence, spatial intellig ence, interp ersonal intellig ence, intrap ersonal intellig ence, and na turalis tic
intellig ence. Among c ognitiv e ps ychologis ts, Gardner ’s theor y has b een he avily criticiz ed for lacking empiric al
evidenc e. Ho wever, educators c ontinue to s tudy and use G ardner ’s theor y, with some c olleg es ev en discus sing
how the y integra te G ardner ’s theor y into their clas srooms . Got tfredson describ es one p ossible re ason f or the
continue d use o f Gardner ’s theor y: “ . . . tha t there are multiple indep endent intellig ences, sugg esting tha t
everyone c an b e smar t in some w ay. This is , unders tanda bly, a v ery attractiv e ide a in demo cratic so cieties”
(2004).
Gardner ’s inter - and intrap ersonal intellig ences are o ften c ombine d into a single typ e: emotional intellig ence.
Emot ional intellig enc eencomp asses the a bility to unders tand the emotions o f yourself and others , sho w
emp athy, unders tand so cial rela tionships and cues , and regula te your o wn emotions and resp ond in culturally
appropria te w ays (Parker, Saklo fske, & Stough , 2009). P eople with high emotional intellig ence typic ally ha ve
well-dev elop ed so cial skills . Some rese archers , including Daniel Goleman , the a uthor o fEmotional
Intellig ence: Wh y It C an Ma tter More than IQ , argue tha t emotional intellig ence is a b etter pre dictor o f suc cess
than traditional intellig ence (Goleman , 1995). Ho wever, emotional intellig ence has b een widely deb ated, with7.4 • Wha t Are Int elligence and Cr eativity? 229
rese archers p ointing out inc onsis tencies in ho w it is define d and describ ed, as w ell as ques tioning results o f
studies on a subject tha t is difficult to me asure and s tudy empiric ally (Lo cke, 2005; Ma yer, Salo vey, & C aruso,
2004)
The mos t comprehensiv e theor y of intellig ence to da te is the C attell-Horn-C arroll (CHC) theor y of cognitiv e
abilities (Schneider & McGrew , 2018). In this theor y, abilities are rela ted and arrang ed in a hierarch y with
general a bilities a t the top , bro ad a bilities in the middle , and narro w (sp ecific) a bilities a t the b ottom . The
narro w abilities are the only ones tha t can b e directly me asure d; ho wever, the y are integra ted within the other
abilities . At the g eneral lev el is g eneral intellig ence. Next, the bro ad lev el consis ts of general a bilities such as
fluid re asoning , shor t-term memor y, and pro cessing sp eed. Finally , as the hierarch y continues , the narro w
level includes sp ecific f orms o f cognitiv e abilities . For e xample , shor t-term memor y would fur ther bre ak do wn
into memor y sp an and w orking memor y capacity .
Intellig ence can also ha ve diff erent me anings and v alues in diff erent cultures . If y ou liv e on a small island ,
where mos t people g et their f ood by fishing from b oats, it w ould b e imp ortant to kno w ho w to fish and ho w to
repair a b oat. If y ou w ere an e xceptional angler , your p eers w ould prob ably c onsider y ou intellig ent. If y ou w ere
also skille d at rep airing b oats, your intellig ence might b e kno wn acros s the whole island . Think a bout y our
own family ’s culture . Wha t values are imp ortant f or La tinx families? Italian families? In Irish families ,
hospitality and telling an enter taining s tory are marks o f the culture . If y ou are a skille d storyteller , other
memb ers o f Irish culture are lik ely to c onsider y ou intellig ent.
Some cultures plac e a high v alue on w orking tog ether as a c ollectiv e. In these cultures , the imp ortanc e of the
group sup erse des the imp ortanc e of individual achiev ement . When y ou visit such a culture , how w ell y ou

•Describe the purposes and benefits o f intelligence testing
While y ou’re lik ely familiar with the term “IQ ” and as sociate it with the ide a of intellig ence, wha t do es IQ re ally
mean? IQ s tands f orintellig enc e quot ient and describ es a sc ore e arne d on a tes t designe d to me asure
intellig ence. You’ve alre ady le arne d tha t there are man y ways ps ychologis ts describ e intellig ence (or more
aptly , intellig ences). Similarly , IQ tes ts—the to ols designe d to me asure intellig ence—ha ve been the subject o f
deb ate throughout their dev elopment and use .
When might an IQ tes t be use d? Wha t do w e learn from the results , and ho w might p eople use this
informa tion? While there are c ertainly man y benefits to intellig ence tes ting , it is imp ortant to also note the
limita tions and c ontro versies surrounding these tes ts. For e xample , IQ tes ts ha ve sometimes b een use d as
arguments in supp ort of insidious purp oses , such as the eug enics mo vement (Sev erson , 2011). The infamous
Supreme C ourt Case,Buck v . Bell , leg alized the f orced steriliza tion o f some p eople deeme d “feeble -minde d”
through this typ e of tes ting , resulting in a bout 65,000 s teriliza tions ( Buck v . Bell , 274 U .S. 200; K o, 2016).
Today, only pro fessionals traine d in ps ycholog y can adminis ter IQ tes ts, and the purchase o f mos t tes ts
requires an adv anced degree in ps ycholog y. Other pro fessionals in the field , such as so cial w orkers and
psychia trists, cannot adminis ter IQ tes ts. In this section , we will e xplore wha t intellig ence tes ts me asure , how
they are sc ored, and ho w the y were dev elop ed.
Measuring Intelligence
It seems tha t the human unders tanding o f intellig ence is somewha t limite d when w e focus on traditional or
academic -typ e intellig ence. Ho w then , can intellig ence be me asure d? And when w e me asure intellig ence, how
do w e ensure tha t we capture wha t we’re re ally tr ying to me asure (in other w ords , tha t IQ tes ts function as v alid
measures o f intellig ence)? In the f ollowing p aragraphs , we will e xplore ho w intellig ence tes ts w ere dev elop ed
and the his tory of their use .
The IQ tes t has b een s ynon ymous with intellig ence for o ver a c entur y. In the la te 1800s , Sir F rancis G alton
develop ed the firs t bro ad tes t of intellig ence (Flana gan & K aufman , 2004). A lthough he w as not a ps ychologis t,
his c ontributions to the c oncepts o f intellig ence tes ting are s till f elt to day (Gordon , 1995). R eliable intellig ence
testing ( you ma y rec all from e arlier chapters tha t relia bility ref ers to a tes t’s ability to pro duce consis tent
results) b egan in e arnes t during the e arly 1900s with a rese archer name d Alfred Binet ( Figure 7.13 ). Binet w as
asked by the F rench g overnment to dev elop an intellig ence tes t to use on children to determine which ones
might ha ve difficulty in scho ol; it include d man y verbally b ased tasks . Americ an rese archers so on re alized the
value o f such tes ting . Louis T erman , a Stanf ord pro fessor, mo difie d Binet ’s work b y standardizing the

scoring , and interpreta tion o f results is c onsis tent .Norming involves giving a tes t to a larg e popula tion so da ta
can b e collecte d comp aring groups , such as a ge groups . The resulting da ta pro vide norms , or ref erential
scores , by which to interpret future sc ores . Norms are not e xpecta tions o f wha t a giv en group should kno w but
a demons tration o f wha t tha t group doeskno w. Norming and s tandardizing the tes t ensures tha t new sc ores
are relia ble. This new v ersion o f the tes t was c alled the Stanf ord-Binet Intellig ence Sc ale ( Terman , 1916).
Remarka bly, an up dated version o f this tes t is s till widely use d to day.

In 1939, Da vid W echsler , a ps ychologis t who sp ent p art of his c areer w orking with W orld W ar I v eterans ,
develop ed a new IQ tes t in the Unite d Sta tes. Wechsler c ombine d sev eral subtes ts from other intellig ence tes ts
used between 1880 and W orld W ar I. These subtes ts tapp ed into a v ariety o f verbal and non verbal skills ,
because W echsler b eliev ed tha t intellig ence enc omp assed “the glob al capacity o f a p erson to act purp osefully ,
to think ra tionally , and to de al eff ectiv ely with his en vironment ” (Wechsler , 1958, p . 7). He name d the tes t the
Wechsler -Bellevue Intellig ence Sc ale ( Wechsler , 1981). This c ombina tion o f subtes ts became one o f the mos t
extensiv ely use d intellig ence tes ts in the his tory of psycholog y. Although its name w as la ter chang ed to the
Wechsler A dult Intellig ence Sc ale ( WAIS) and has b een revise d sev eral times , the aims o f the tes t remain
virtually unchang ed sinc e its inc eption (Bo ake, 2002). T oday, there are three intellig ence tes ts cre dite d to
Wechsler , the W echsler A dult Intellig ence Sc ale-fourth e dition ( WAIS-IV), the W echsler Intellig ence Sc ale f or
Children ( WISC -V), and the W echsler P rescho ol and P rimar y Sc ale o f Intellig ence—IV ( WPPSI-IV ) (Wechsler ,
2012). These tes ts are use d widely in scho ols and c ommunities throughout the Unite d Sta tes, and the y are
perio dically norme d and s tandardiz ed as a me ans o f rec alibra tion . As a p art of the rec alibra tion pro cess, the
WISC -V w as giv en to thousands o f children acros s the c ountr y, and children taking the tes t today are c omp ared
with their same -age peers ( Figure 7.13 ).
The WISC -V is c omp osed of 14 subtes ts, which c omprise fiv e indic es, which then render an IQ sc ore. The fiv e
indic es are V erbal Comprehension , Visual S patial, Fluid R easoning , Working Memor y, and P rocessing S peed.
When the tes t is c omplete , individuals rec eive a sc ore f or e ach o f the fiv e indic es and a F ull Sc ale IQ sc ore. The

Interes tingly , the p erio dic rec alibra tions ha ve led to an interes ting obser vation kno wn as the Flynn eff ect.
Name d after J ames Flynn , who w as among the firs t to describ e this trend , the Flynn eff ectrefers to the

that incre ased IQ sc ores do not nec essarily me an tha t young er g enera tions are more intellig ent p er se (Flynn ,

Ultima tely, we are s till left with the ques tion o f ho w valid intellig ence tes ts are . Certainly , the mos t mo dern

in IQ tes ting , the degree to which an y tes t can tr uly me asure an individual ’s intellig ence, and the use o f the
results o f IQ tes ts are s till is sues o f deb ate (Gresham & W itt, 1997; Flynn , Sha ughnes sy, & F ulgham , 2012;
Richardson , 2002; Schling er, 2003).
Capital Punishment and P eople with Intellectual Disabilities
The case o fAtkins v . Virginia was a landmark case in the Unit ed Stat es Supr eme Cour t. On Aug ust 16, 1996, tw o
men, Dar yl Atkins and Wil liam Jones , robbed, kidnapped, and then shot and kil led Eric Nesbit t, a local airman
from the U .S. Air F orce. A clinical ps ychologis t evaluat ed A tkins and t estified at the trial that A tkins had an IQ o f
59. The mean IQ sc ore is 100. The ps ychologis t concluded that A tkins had an int ellectual disability .
The jur y found A tkins g uilty, and he w as sent enced to death. A tkins and his at torne ys appealed t o the Supr eme
Cour t. In June 2002, the Supr eme Cour t reversed a pr evious decision and ruled that e xecutions o f people with
intellectual disabilities ar e ‘cruel and unusual punishments’ pr ohibit ed b y the Eighth Amendment. Using the
accepted lang uage of the time , the c ourt wrote in their decision:
Clinical definitions o f mental r etar dation r equir e not onl y suba verage int ellectual functioning , but also
significant limitations in adap tive skil ls. Mental ly retar ded persons fr equentl y kno w the diff erence
betw een right and wr ong and ar e compet ent t o stand trial . Because o f their impairments , however, by
definition the y ha ve diminished capacities t o unders tand and pr ocess inf ormation, t o communicat e, to
abstract fr om mis takes and learn fr om e xperienc e, to eng age in logical r easoning , to contr ol impulses ,
and t o unders tand others’ r eactions . Their deficiencies do not w arrant an e xemp tion fr om criminal
sanctions , but diminish their personal culpability ( Atkins v . Virginia , 2002, par . 5).
The c ourt also decided that ther e was a s tate legislatur e consensus ag ains t the e xecution o f people with
intellectual disabilities and that this c onsensus should s tand f or al l of the s tates. The Supr eme Cour t ruling left it
up to the s tates to det ermine their o wn definitions o f intellectual disability . The definitions v ary among s tates as
to who can be e xecut ed. In the A tkins case , a jur y decided that because he had man y contacts with his la wyers
and thus w as pr ovided with int ellectual s timulation, his IQ had r epor tedly incr eased t o a le vel wher e the s tate
could e xecut e him. He w as giv en an e xecution dat e and then r eceived a s tay of execution aft er it w as revealed
that la wyers f or co-def endant, Wil liam Jones , coached Jones t o “produc e a t estimon y ag ains t Mr. Atkins that did
match the e videnc e” (Lip tak, 2008). Aft er the r evelation o f this misc onduct, A tkins w as re-sent enced to life
imprisonment.
Atkins v . Virginia (2002) highlights se veral is sues r egarding society ’s beliefs ar ound int elligence. In the A tkins
case , the Supr eme Cour t decided that int ellectual disability does affect decision making and ther efore should
affect the natur e of the punishment such criminals r eceive. Wher e, however, should the lines o f intellectual
disability be dr awn? In Ma y 2014, the Supr eme Cour t ruled in a r elated case ( Hall v. Florida ) that IQ sc ores
cannot be used as a final det ermination o f a prisoner ’s eligibility f or the death penal ty (R ober ts, 2014).
The Bell Curve
The results o f intellig ence tes ts follow the b ell cur ve, a graph in the g eneral shap e of a b ell. When the b ell cur veWHA T DO Y OU THINK?7.5 • Measur es o f Int elligence233
is use d in ps ychologic al tes ting , the graph demons trates a normal dis tribution o f a trait , in this c ase,
intellig ence, in the human p opula tion . Man y human traits na turally f ollow the b ell cur ve. For e xample , if y ou
line d up all y our f emale scho olma tes ac cording to height , it is lik ely tha t a larg e clus ter o f them w ould b e the
average height f or an Americ an w oman: 5’4” –5’6” . This clus ter w ould fall in the c enter o f the b ell cur ve,
representing the a verage height f or Americ an w omen ( Figure 7.14 ). There w ould b e fewer w omen who s tand
closer to 4’11” . The same w ould b e true for w omen o f above-average height: those who s tand closer to 5’11” .
The trick to finding a b ell cur ve in na ture is to use a larg e sample siz e. Without a larg e sample siz e, it is les s
likely tha t the b ell cur ve will represent the wider p opula tion . Arepresentat ive sample is a subset o f the
popula tion tha t accura tely represents the g eneral p opula tion . If, f or e xample , you me asure d the height o f the
women in y our clas sroom only , you might not actually ha ve a representa tive sample . Perhaps the w omen ’s
basketball te am w ante d to tak e this c ourse tog ether , and the y are all in y our clas s. Bec ause b asketball pla yers
tend to b e taller than a verage, the w omen in y our clas s ma y not b e a g ood representa tive sample o f the
popula tion o f Americ an w omen . But if y our sample include d all the w omen a t your scho ol, it is lik ely tha t their
heights w ould f orm a na tural b ell cur ve.
FIGURE 7.14 Are you o f belo w-average, average, or abo ve-average height?
The same principles apply to intellig ence tes ts sc ores . Individuals e arn a sc ore c alled an intellig ence quotient
(IQ). O ver the y ears, diff erent typ es o f IQ tes ts ha ve ev olved, but the w ay sc ores are interprete d remains the
same . On mos t IQ tes ts, the a verage (or me an) IQ sc ore is 100. Standard de viat ions describ e ho w da ta are
disp erse d in a p opula tion and giv e conte xt to larg e da ta sets . The b ell cur ve uses the s tandard devia tion to
show ho w all sc ores are disp erse d from the a verage sc ore ( Figure 7.15 ). In mo dern IQ tes ting , one s tandard
devia tion is 15 p oints . So a sc ore o f 85 w ould b e describ ed as “ one s tandard devia tion b elow the me an.” Ho w
would y ou describ e a sc ore o f 115 and a sc ore o f 70? An y IQ sc ore tha t falls within one s tandard devia tion
above and b elow the me an ( between 85 and 115) is c onsidere d average, and 68% o f the p opula tion has IQ
scores in this rang e. An IQ sc ore o f 130 or a bove is c onsidere d a sup erior lev el.234 7 • Thinking and Int elligence

FIGURE 7.15 The majority o f people ha ve an IQ sc ore betw een 85 and 115.
Only 2.2% o f the p opula tion has an IQ sc ore b elow 70 (Americ an P sychia tric As sociation [AP A], 2013). If a
person e arns a sc ore appro xima tely tw o standard devia tions b elow the me an on an intellig ence tes t, (about 70

On the other end o f the intellig ence sp ectr um are those individuals whose IQs fall into the highes t rang es.
Consis tent with the b ell cur ve, about 2% o f the p opula tion falls into this c ategory. People are c onsidere d to

an IQ sc ore o f 130 or higher , or sup erior intellig ence in a p articular are a. Long a go, popular b elief sugg ested
that people o f high intellig ence were maladjus ted. This ide a was dispro ven through a groundbre aking s tudy o f
these children . In 1921, Lewis T erman b egan a longitudinal s tudy o f over 1500 children with IQs o ver 135
(Terman , 1925). His findings sho wed tha t these children b ecame w ell-e duc ated, suc cessful adults who w ere, in7.5 • Measur es o f Int elligence235

average in ph ysical build and a ttractiv enes s, disp elling an e arlier p opular notion tha t highly intellig ent p eople
were “ weaklings .” Some p eople with v ery high IQs elect to join Mensa, an org aniza tion de dicated to identif ying ,
rese arching , and f ostering intellig ence. Memb ers mus t ha ve an IQ sc ore in the top 2% o f the p opula tion , and
they ma y be re quire d to p ass other e xams in their applic ation to join the group .
What’ s in a Name? Intellectual Disabilities
In the pas t, individuals with IQ sc ores belo w 70 and significant adap tive and social functioning dela ys were
diagnosed with mental r etar dation. When this diagnosis w as firs t named, it w as replacing mor e neg ative and
insensitiv e terms , and the title held no social s tigma; se veral pr ominent r esear ch and suppor t organizations e ven
used the w ord in their names and mis sion s tatements . Ho wever, members o f those populations as w ell as their
families and suppor ting pr ofessionals f ound that the t erm w as not onl y inac curate, but demeaning and insul ting.
As such, the DSM-5 no w labels this diagnosis as “int ellectual disability .” Man y states onc e had a Depar tment o f
Mental R etar dation t o ser ve those diagnosed with such c ognitiv e dela ys, but mos t have chang ed their name t o
Depar tment o f De velopmental Disabilities or something similar in lang uage. Due t o the pas sage of "Rosa's Law"
in 2010 and t o the gr owing suppor t for changing the t erminolog y, mos t U.S. feder al ag encies f ormal ly adop ted
the w ords "int ellectual disability ." While the chang e was widel y suppor ted, y ou can vie w in the F eder al Regis ter
several count erpoints fr om par ents o f people with int ellectual disabilities , who f elt that the ne w term w as

terminolog y is lik ely to chang e ag ain? Wh y or wh y not?
Why Measur e Intelligence?
The v alue o f IQ tes ting is mos t evident in e duc ational or clinic al set tings . Children who seem to b e
experiencing le arning difficulties or sev ere b ehavioral problems c an b e tes ted to asc ertain whether the child ’s
difficulties c an b e partly a ttribute d to an IQ sc ore tha t is signific antly diff erent from the me an f or their a ge
group . Without IQ tes ting— or another me asure o f intellig ence—children and adults nee ding e xtra supp ort
might not b e identifie d eff ectiv ely. In addition , IQ tes ting is use d in c ourts to determine whether a def endant
has sp ecial or e xtenua ting circums tanc es tha t preclude them from p articip ating in some w ay in a trial . People
also use IQ tes ting results to seek disa bility b enefits from the So cial Security A dminis tration .
The f ollowing c ase s tudy demons trates the usefulnes s and b enefits o f IQ tes ting . Candac e, a 14- year-old girl
experiencing problems a t scho ol in C onnecticut , was ref erre d for a c ourt-ordere d ps ychologic al ev alua tion .
She w as in regular e ducation clas ses in ninth grade and w as failing ev ery subject . Candac e had nev er b een a
stellar s tudent but had alw ays been p assed to the ne xt grade . Frequently , she w ould curse a t an y of her
teachers who c alled on her in clas s. She also g ot into fights with other s tudents and o ccasionally shoplifte d.
When she arriv ed for the ev alua tion , Candac e imme diately said tha t she ha ted ev erything a bout scho ol,
including the te achers , the res t of the s taff, the building , and the homew ork. Her p arents s tated tha t the y felt

High Intelligence: Natur e or Nurtur e?
Where do es high intellig ence come from? Some rese archers b eliev e tha t intellig ence is a trait inherite d from a
person ’s parents . Scientis ts who rese arch this topic typic ally use twin s tudies to determine the herita bility of
intellig ence. The Minnesota Study o f Twins R eared Apart is one o f the mos t well-kno wn twin s tudies . In this
investigation , rese archers f ound tha t identic al twins raise d tog ether and identic al twins raise d ap art exhibit a
higher c orrela tion b etween their IQ sc ores than siblings or fra ternal twins raise d tog ether (Bouchard , Lykken,
McGue , Seg al, & T elleg en, 1990). The findings from this s tudy rev eal a g enetic c omp onent to intellig ence
(Figure 7.16 ). At the same time , other ps ychologis ts believ e tha t intellig ence is shap ed by a child ’s
developmental en vironment . If p arents w ere to pro vide their children with intellectual s timuli from b efore
they are b orn, it is lik ely tha t the y would a bsorb the b enefits o f tha t stimula tion , and it w ould b e reflecte d in
intellig ence lev els.
FIGURE 7.16 The correlations of IQs o f unr elated v ersus r elated persons r eared apar t or t ogether sug gest a g enetic7.6 • The Sour ce of Int elligence237
component t o int elligence.
The re ality is tha t asp ects o f each ide a are prob ably c orrect . In fact , one s tudy sugg ests tha t although g enetics
seem to b e in c ontrol o f the lev el of intellig ence, the en vironmental influenc es pro vide b oth s tability and
chang e to trigg er manif estation o f cognitiv e abilities (Bar tels, Rietv eld, Van Baal , & Bo omsma, 2002). C ertainly ,
there are b ehaviors tha t supp ort the dev elopment o f intellig ence, but the g enetic c omp onent o f high
intellig ence should not b e ignore d. As with all herita ble traits , however, it is not alw ays possible to isola te ho w
and when high intellig ence is p assed on to the ne xt genera tion .
Rang e of R eaction is the theor y tha t each p erson resp onds to the en vironment in a unique w ay based on their
genetic mak eup. According to this ide a, your g enetic p otential is a fix ed quantity , but whether y ou re ach y our
full intellectual p otential is dep endent up on the en vironmental s timula tion y ou e xperienc e, esp ecially in
childho od. Think a bout this sc enario: A c ouple adopts a child who has a verage genetic intellectual p otential .
The y raise her in an e xtremely s timula ting en vironment . Wha t will happ en to the c ouple ’s new da ughter? It is
likely tha t the s timula ting en vironment will impro ve her intellectual outc omes o ver the c ourse o f her lif e. But
wha t happ ens if this e xperiment is rev erse d? If a child with an e xtremely s trong g enetic b ackground is plac ed
in an en vironment tha t do es not s timula te him: Wha t happ ens? Interes tingly , according to a longitudinal s tudy
of highly gifte d individuals , it w as found tha t “the tw o extremes o f optimal and p athologic al experienc e are
both represente d disprop ortiona tely in the b ackgrounds o f cre ative individuals” ; however, those who
experienc ed supp ortive family en vironments w ere more lik ely to rep ort being happ y (Csiks zentmihalyi &
Csiks zentmihalyi , 1993, p . 187).
Another challeng e to determining origins o f high intellig ence is the c onfounding na ture o f our human so cial
structures . It is troubling to note tha t some ethnic groups p erform b etter on IQ tes ts than others —and it is
likely tha t the results do not ha ve much to do with the quality o f each ethnic group ’s intellect . The same is tr ue
for so cioeconomic s tatus. Children who liv e in p overty experienc e more p ervasiv e, daily s tres s than children
who do not w orry about the b asic nee ds o f safety, shelter , and f ood. These w orries c an neg atively a ffect ho w the
brain functions and dev elops , causing a dip in IQ sc ores . Mark Kishiy ama and his c olleagues determine d tha t
children living in p overty demons trated re duced prefrontal brain functioning c omp arable to children with
dama ge to the la teral prefrontal c ortex (Kishiy ama, Bo yce, Jimene z, Perry, & K night , 2009).
The deb ate around the f ounda tions and influenc es on intellig ence explo ded in 1969, when an e duc ational
psychologis t name d Ar thur J ensen publishe d the ar ticle “Ho w Much C an W e Bo ost I.Q. and A chiev ement ” in
the Har vard E ducational R eview . Jensen had adminis tere d IQ tes ts to div erse groups o f students , and his
results le d him to the c onclusion tha t IQ is determine d by genetics . He also p osite d tha t intellig ence was made
up o f two typ es o f abilities: Lev el I and Lev el II. In his theor y, Lev el I is resp onsible f or rote memoriza tion ,
where as Lev el II is resp onsible f or c onceptual and analytic al abilities . According to his findings , Lev el I
remaine d consis tent among the human rac e. Lev el II, ho wever, exhibite d diff erenc es among ethnic groups
(Mo dgil & R outle dge, 1987). J ensen ’s mos t contro versial c onclusion w as tha t Lev el II intellig ence is prev alent
among Asian p eople , then White p eople , then Black p eople . Robert Williams w as among those who c alled out
racial bias in J ensen ’s results ( Williams , 1970).
Obviously , Jensen ’s interpreta tion o f his o wn da ta caused an intense resp onse in a na tion tha t continue d to
grapple with the eff ects o f racism (F ox, 2012). While ev en some who to ok is sue with J ensen 's findings
indic ated tha t the y did not detect o vert racism in his w ork, Jensen himself made a numb er o f racis t statements
during an inter view with a White na tionalis t public ation ,Americ an R enais sanc e. He indic ated his b elief tha t
man y Black p eople w ere not " educable up to a lev el for which there ’s an y ec onomic demand ," while also ha ving
a higher bir th ra te than other groups , which w ould le ad to a shift in p opula tion and a deteriora tion o f the
nation ( Taylor , 1992). Ho wever, Jensen ’s ide as w ere not solitar y or unique; ra ther , the y represente d one o f
man y examples o f psychologis ts as serting racial diff erenc es in IQ and c ognitiv e ability . In fact , Rushton and
Jensen (2005) review ed three dec ades w orth o f rese arch on the rela tionship b etween rac e and c ognitiv e ability .

intellig ence are a t the c ore o f his c onclusions .
In a rela ted story, parents o f Afric an Americ an s tudents file d a c ase a gains t the Sta te of California in 1979,
because the y believ ed tha t the tes ting metho d use d to identif y students with le arning disa bilities w as

metho d use d by the s tate disprop ortiona tely identifie d Afric an Americ an children as “mentally retarde d,"
which resulte d in man y students b eing inc orrectly clas sifie d. According to a summar y of the c ase,Larr y P. v.
Riles :
In viola tion o f Title VI o f the Civil Rights A ct of 1964, the R ehabilita tion A ct of 1973, and the E duc ation

Black children in the sp ecial E.M.R . clas ses. (Larr y P. v. Riles , par. 6)
Onc e again, the limita tions o f intellig ence tes ting w ere rev ealed.
What ar e Learning Disabilities?
Learning disa bilities are c ognitiv e disorders tha t affect diff erent are as o f cognition , particularly langua ge or
reading . It should b e pointe d out tha t learning disa bilities are not the same thing as intellectual disa bilities .
Learning disa bilities are c onsidere d sp ecific neurologic al imp airments ra ther than glob al intellectual or
developmental disa bilities . A p erson with a langua ge disa bility has difficulty unders tanding or using sp oken
langua ge, where as someone with a re ading disa bility , such as dy slexia, has difficulty pro cessing wha t the y are
reading .
Often , learning disa bilities are not rec ogniz ed until a child re aches scho ol age. One c onfounding asp ect o f
learning disa bilities is tha t the y mos t often a ffect children with a verage to a bove-average intellig ence. In other
words , the disa bility is sp ecific to a p articular are a and not a me asure o f overall intellectual a bility . At the same
time , learning disa bilities tend to e xhibit c omorbidity with other disorders , like attention-deficit h yperactivity
disorder (ADHD). An ywhere b etween 30–70% o f individuals with dia gnose d cases o f ADHD also ha ve some sor t
of learning disa bility (Ric cio, Gonzales , & Hynd , 1994). Let ’s tak e a lo ok a t three e xamples o f common le arning
disa bilities: dy sgraphia, dy slexia, and dy scalculia.
Dysgr aphia
Children with dysgraphia have a le arning disa bility tha t results in a s truggle to write legibly . The ph ysical task
of writing with a p en and p aper is e xtremely challenging f or the p erson . These children o ften ha ve extreme
difficulty put ting their thoughts do wn on p aper (Smits -Eng elsman & V an G alen , 1997). This difficulty is
inconsis tent with a p erson ’s IQ . Tha t is, based on the child ’s IQ and/or a bilities in other are as, a child with
dysgraphia should b e able to write , but c an’t. Children with dy sgraphia ma y also ha ve problems with sp atial
abilities .
Students with dy sgraphia nee d ac ademic ac commo dations to help them suc ceed in scho ol. These
accommo dations c an pro vide s tudents with alterna tive as sessment opp ortunities to demons trate wha t the y
kno w (Bar ton, 2003). F or e xample , a s tudent with dy sgraphia might b e permit ted to tak e an oral e xam ra ther
than a traditional p aper-and-p encil tes t. Treatment is usually pro vide d by an o ccup ational therapis t, although
there is some ques tion as to ho w eff ectiv e such tre atment is (Z wick er, 2005).
Dysle xia
Dyslexia is the mos t common le arning disa bility in children . An individual with dyslexiaexhibits an ina bility

Summary
7.1What Is Cognition?
In this section , you w ere intro duced to c ognitiv e ps ycholog y, which is the s tudy o f cognition , or the brain ’s
ability to think , perceive, plan , analyz e, and rememb er. Concepts and their c orresp onding prototyp es help us
quickly org aniz e our thinking b y cre ating c ategories into which w e can sor t new inf orma tion . We also dev elop
schema ta, which are clus ters o f rela ted concepts . Some schema ta in volve routines o f thought and b ehavior ,
and these help us function prop erly in v arious situa tions without ha ving to “ think twic e” about them .
Schema ta sho w up in so cial situa tions and routines o f daily b ehavior .
7.2Language
Langua ge is a c ommunic ation s ystem tha t has b oth a le xicon and a s ystem o f grammar . Langua ge ac quisition
occurs na turally and eff ortlessly during the e arly s tages o f life, and this ac quisition o ccurs in a pre dicta ble
sequenc e for individuals around the w orld . Langua ge has a s trong influenc e on thought , and the c oncept o f
how langua ge ma y influenc e cognition remains an are a of study and deb ate in ps ycholog y.
7.3Problem Solving
Man y diff erent s trategies e xist for solving problems . Typic al strategies include trial and error , applying
algorithms , and using heuris tics. To solv e a larg e, complic ated problem , it o ften helps to bre ak the problem
into smaller s teps tha t can b e ac complishe d individually , leading to an o verall solution . Roadblo cks to problem
solving include a mental set , functional fix ednes s, and v arious biases tha t can cloud decision making skills .
7.4What Ar e Intelligence and Cr eativity?
Intellig ence is a c omple x characteris tic o f cognition . Man y theories ha ve been dev elop ed to e xplain wha t
intellig ence is and ho w it w orks . Sternb erg g enera ted his triarchic theor y of intellig ence, where as G ardner

intellig ence. Finally , cre ativity seems to b e a fac et of intellig ence, but it is e xtremely difficult to me asure
objectiv ely.
7.5Measur es of Intelligence
In this section , we learne d about the his tory of intellig ence tes ting and some o f the challeng es reg arding
intellig ence tes ting . Intellig ence tes ts began in e arnes t with Binet; W echsler la ter dev elop ed intellig ence tes ts

8.1 How Memory Functions
LEARNING OBJEC TIVES
By the end o f this section, y ou wil l be able t o:
•Discus s the thr ee basic functions o f memor y
•Describe the thr ee s tages o f memor y storage
•Describe and dis tinguish betw een pr ocedur al and declar ative memor y and semantic and episodic memor y
Memor y is an inf orma tion pro cessing s ystem; theref ore, we often c omp are it to a c omputer .Memor yis the set
of pro cesses use d to enc ode, store , and retriev e inf orma tion o ver diff erent p erio ds o f time ( Figure 8.2 ).
FIGURE 8.2 Encoding in volves the input o f information int o the memor y system. St orage is the r etention o f the
encoded inf ormation. R etrie val, or g etting the inf ormation out o f memor y and back int o awarenes s, is the thir d
function.
LINK T O LEARNING
Watch this video a bout the neuroscienc e of memor y(http://openstax.org/l/une xpectfact) to le arn more .
Encoding
We get inf orma tion into our brains through a pro cess calledenc oding , which is the input o f inf orma tion into
the memor y system . Onc e we rec eive sensor y inf orma tion from the en vironment , our brains la bel or c ode it .
We org aniz e the inf orma tion with other similar inf orma tion and c onnect new c oncepts to e xisting c oncepts .
Enc oding inf orma tion o ccurs through a utoma tic pro cessing and eff ortful pro cessing .
If someone asks y ou wha t you a te for lunch to day, more than lik ely y ou c ould rec all this inf orma tion quite
easily . This is kno wn as automat ic pro cessing , or the enc oding o f details lik e time , space, fre quency , and the
meaning o f words . Automa tic pro cessing is usually done without an y conscious a warenes s. Recalling the las t
time y ou s tudie d for a tes t is another e xample o f automa tic pro cessing . But wha t about the actual tes t ma terial
you s tudie d? It prob ably re quire d a lot o f work and a ttention on y our p art in order to enc ode tha t inf orma tion .
This is kno wn as effortful pro cessing (Figure 8.3 ).
FIGURE 8.3 When y ou firs t learn ne w skil ls such as driving a car , you ha ve to put f orth eff ort and at tention t o
encode inf ormation about ho w to start a car , how to brake, how to handle a turn, and so on. Onc e you kno w ho w to
drive, you can enc ode additional inf ormation about this skil l aut omatical ly. (credit: R ober t Couse -Bak er)
Wha t are the mos t eff ectiv e ways to ensure tha t imp ortant memories are w ell enc oded? E ven a simple
sentenc e is e asier to rec all when it is me aningful (Anderson , 1984). R ead the f ollowing sentenc es (Brans ford &
248 8 • Memor y
Access for fr ee a t opens tax. org
McC arrell , 1974), then lo ok a way and c ount b ackw ards from 30 b y threes to z ero, and then tr y to write do wn
the sentenc es (no p eeking b ack a t this p age!).
1. The notes w ere sour b ecause the se ams split .
2. The v oyage wasn't dela yed because the b ottle sha ttere d.
3. The ha ystack w as imp ortant b ecause the cloth ripp ed.
How w ell did y ou do? B y themselv es, the s tatements tha t you wrote do wn w ere mos t lik ely c onfusing and
difficult f or y ou to rec all. Now, try writing them a gain, using the f ollowing prompts: b agpip e, ship chris tening ,
and p arachutis t. Next count b ackw ards from 40 b y fours , then check y ourself to see ho w w ell y ou rec alled the
sentenc es this time . You c an see tha t the sentenc es are no w much more memora ble b ecause e ach o f the
sentenc es w as plac ed in c onte xt. Ma terial is far b etter enc oded when y ou mak e it me aningful .
There are three typ es o f enc oding . The enc oding o f words and their me aning is kno wn as semant ic enc oding .
It was firs t demons trated by William Bous field (1935) in an e xperiment in which he ask ed people to memoriz e
words . The 60 w ords w ere actually divide d into 4 c ategories o f me aning , although the p articip ants did not
kno w this b ecause the w ords w ere randomly presente d. When the y were ask ed to rememb er the w ords , the y
tende d to rec all them in c ategories , sho wing tha t the y paid a ttention to the me anings o f the w ords as the y
learne d them .
Visual enc oding is the enc oding o f ima ges, and acoustic enc oding is the enc oding o f sounds , words in
particular . To see ho w visual enc oding w orks , read o ver this lis t of words: car, lev el, dog , truth, book, value . If
you w ere ask ed later to rec all the w ords from this lis t, which ones do y ou think y ou’d mos t lik ely rememb er?
You w ould prob ably ha ve an e asier time rec alling the w ords car, dog ,and book, and a more difficult time
recalling the w ords level, truth,and value . Wh y is this? Bec ause y ou c an rec all ima ges (mental pictures) more
easily than w ords alone . When y ou re ad the w ords car, dog ,and bookyou cre ated ima ges o f these things in
your mind . These are c oncrete , high-ima gery words . On the other hand , abstract w ords lik elevel, truth,and
value are lo w-ima gery words . High-ima gery words are enc oded both visually and semantic ally (P aivio , 1986),
thus building a s trong er memor y.
Now let ’s turn our a ttention to ac oustic enc oding . You are driving in y our c ar and a song c omes on the radio
that you ha ven’t he ard in a t least 10 y ears, but y ou sing along , rec alling ev ery word. In the Unite d Sta tes,
children o ften le arn the alpha bet through song , and the y learn the numb er o f days in e ach month through
rhyme: “Thir ty da ys ha th Septemb er, / A pril, June , and N ovemb er; / A ll the res t ha ve thir ty-one , / Sa ve
February, with tw enty -eight da ys cle ar, / And tw enty -nine e ach le ap y ear.” These les sons are e asy to rememb er
because o f acoustic enc oding . We enc ode the sounds the w ords mak e. This is one o f the re asons wh y much o f
wha t we teach y oung children is done through song , rhyme , and rh ythm .
Which o f the three typ es o f enc oding do y ou think w ould giv e you the b est memor y of verbal inf orma tion?
Some y ears a go, psychologis ts Fergus C raik and Endel T ulving (1975) c onducte d a series o f experiments to
find out . Particip ants w ere giv en w ords along with ques tions a bout them . The ques tions re quire d the
particip ants to pro cess the w ords a t one o f the three lev els. The visual pro cessing ques tions include d such
things as asking the p articip ants a bout the f ont o f the let ters . The ac oustic pro cessing ques tions ask ed the
particip ants a bout the sound or rh yming o f the w ords , and the semantic pro cessing ques tions ask ed the
particip ants a bout the me aning o f the w ords . After p articip ants w ere presente d with the w ords and ques tions ,
they were giv en an une xpecte d rec all or rec ognition task .
Words tha t had b een enc oded semantic ally w ere b etter rememb ered than those enc oded visually or
acoustically. Semantic enc oding in volves a deep er lev el of pro cessing than the shallo wer visual or ac oustic
encoding . Craik and T ulving c onclude d tha t we pro cess verbal inf orma tion b est through semantic enc oding ,
especially if w e apply wha t is c alled the self -referenc e eff ect. The self -ref erenc e eff ectis the tendency f or an
individual to ha ve better memor y for inf orma tion tha t rela tes to oneself in c omp arison to ma terial tha t has les s
personal relev ance (R ogers, Kuiper, & Kirk er, 1977). C ould semantic enc oding b e beneficial to y ou as y ou8.1 • Ho w Memor y Functions 249

In order f or a memor y to g o into s tora ge (i.e., long-term memor y), it has to p ass through three dis tinct s tages:

Atkinson and Shiffrin 's mo del is not the only mo del o f memor y. Baddele y and Hitch (1974) prop osed a w orking
memor y mo del in which shor t-term memor y has diff erent f orms . In their mo del, storing memories in shor t-
term memor y is lik e op ening diff erent files on a c omputer and adding inf orma tion . The w orking memor y files
hold a limite d amount o f inf orma tion . The typ e of shor t-term memor y (or c omputer file) dep ends on the typ e
of inf orma tion rec eived. There are memories in visual-sp atial f orm , as w ell as memories o f spoken or writ ten
material , and the y are s tore d in three shor t-term s ystems: a visuosp atial sk etchp ad, an episo dic buff er
(Baddele y, 2000), and a phonologic al lo op. According to Baddele y and Hitch , a c entral e xecutiv e part of
memor y sup ervises or c ontrols the flo w of inf orma tion to and from the three shor t-term s ystems , and the
central e xecutiv e is resp onsible f or mo ving inf orma tion into long-term memor y.
Sensory Memory
In the A tkinson-Shiffrin mo del, stimuli from the en vironment are pro cessed firs t in sensor y memor y: stora ge
of brief sensor y ev ents , such as sights , sounds , and tas tes. It is v ery brief s tora ge—up to a c ouple o f sec onds . We
are c onstantly b omb arde d with sensor y inf orma tion . We cannot a bsorb all o f it, or ev en mos t of it. And mos t of
it has no imp act on our liv es. For e xample , wha t was y our pro fessor w earing the las t clas s perio d? As long as
the pro fessor w as dres sed appropria tely, it do es not re ally ma tter wha t she w as w earing . Sensor y inf orma tion
about sights , sounds , smells , and ev en te xtures , which w e do not view as v alua ble inf orma tion , we disc ard. If
we view something as v alua ble, the inf orma tion will mo ve into our shor t-term memor y system .
Short-T erm Memory
Shor t-term memor y (S TM) is a temp orar y stora ge system tha t pro cesses inc oming sensor y memor y. The
terms shor t-term and w orking memor y are sometimes use d interchang eably, but the y are not e xactly the
same . Shor t-term memor y is more ac cura tely describ ed as a c omp onent o f working memor y. Shor t-term
memor y tak es inf orma tion from sensor y memor y and sometimes c onnects tha t memor y to something alre ady250 8 • Memor y

in long-term memor y. Shor t-term memor y stora ge las ts 15 to 30 sec onds . Think o f it as the inf orma tion y ou
have displa yed on y our c omputer screen , such as a do cument , spre adsheet , or w ebsite . Then , inf orma tion in
STM g oes to long-term memor y (you sa ve it to y our hard driv e), or it is disc arde d (you delete a do cument or
close a w eb bro wser).
Rehe arsal moves inf orma tion from shor t-term memor y to long-term memor y. Active rehe arsal is a w ay of
attending to inf orma tion to mo ve it from shor t-term to long-term memor y. During activ e rehe arsal , you rep eat
(practic e) the inf orma tion to b e rememb ered. If y ou rep eat it enough , it ma y be mo ved into long-term memor y.
For e xample , this typ e of activ e rehe arsal is the w ay man y children le arn their ABCs b y singing the alpha bet
song . Alterna tively, ela borative rehe arsal is the act o f linking new inf orma tion y ou are tr ying to le arn to
existing inf orma tion tha t you alre ady kno w. For e xample , if y ou meet someone a t a p arty and y our phone is
dead but y ou w ant to rememb er his phone numb er, which s tarts with are a code 203, y ou might rememb er tha t
your uncle Ab dul liv es in C onnecticut and has a 203 are a code. This w ay, when y ou tr y to rememb er the phone
numb er o f your new prosp ectiv e friend , you will e asily rememb er the are a code. Craik and Lo ckhar t (1972)
prop osed the lev els o f pro cessing h ypothesis tha t states the deep er you think a bout something , the b etter y ou
rememb er it .
You ma y find y ourself asking , “Ho w much inf orma tion c an our memor y handle a t onc e?” To explore the
capacity and dura tion o f your shor t-term memor y, have a p artner re ad the s trings o f random numb ers ( Figure

point y ou should tr y to write do wn the s tring o f numb ers from memor y.
FIGURE 8.5 Work thr ough this series o f numbers using the r ecal l exercise e xplained abo ve to det ermine the long est
string o f digits that y ou can s tore.
Note the long est string a t which y ou g ot the series c orrect . For mos t people , the c apacity will prob ably b e close
to 7 plus or minus 2. In 1956, Georg e Miller review ed mos t of the rese arch on the c apacity o f shor t-term
memor y and f ound tha t people c an retain b etween 5 and 9 items , so he rep orted the c apacity o f shor t-term
memor y was the "ma gic numb er" 7 plus or minus 2. Ho wever, more c ontemp orar y rese arch has f ound
working memor y capacity is 4 plus or minus 1 (C owan, 2010). Generally , rec all is somewha t better f or random

encoding ) rather than inf orma tion w e see ( visual enc oding ) (Anderson , 1969).
Memor y trac e dec ay and inter ferenc e are tw o factors tha t affect shor t-term memor y retention . Peterson and
Peterson (1959) in vestigated shor t-term memor y using the three let ter se quenc es c alled trigrams (e .g., CLS )
that had to b e rec alled after v arious time inter vals b etween 3 and 18 sec onds . Particip ants rememb ered about
80% o f the trigrams a fter a 3-sec ond dela y, but only 10% a fter a dela y of 18 sec onds , which c aused them to
conclude tha t shor t-term memor y dec ayed in 18 sec onds . During dec ay, the memor y trac e becomes les s
activ ated over time , and the inf orma tion is f orgotten. Ho wever, Kepp el and Under wood (1962) e xamine d only
the firs t trials o f the trigram task and f ound tha t pro activ e inter ferenc e also a ffecte d shor t-term memor y
retention . During pro activ e inter ferenc e, previously le arne d inf orma tion inter feres with the a bility to le arn
new inf orma tion . Both memor y trac e dec ay and pro activ e inter ferenc e affect shor t-term memor y. Onc e the
informa tion re aches long-term memor y, it has to b e consolida ted at both the s ynaptic lev el, which tak es a f ew

Long-term Memory
Long -term memor y (LTM) is the c ontinuous s tora ge of inf orma tion . Unlik e shor t-term memor y, long-term
memor y stora ge capacity is b eliev ed to b e unlimite d. It enc omp asses all the things y ou c an rememb er tha t

butter”? Did y ou think o f jelly? If y ou did , you prob ably ha ve as sociated peanut but ter and jelly in y our mind . It
is generally ac cepte d tha t memories are org aniz ed in semantic (or as sociative) netw orks (C ollins & Lo ftus ,
1975). A semantic netw ork c onsis ts of concepts , and as y ou ma y rec all from wha t you’ve learne d about
memor y, concepts are c ategories or groupings o f linguis tic inf orma tion , ima ges, ide as, or memories , such as
life experienc es. Although individual e xperienc es and e xpertise c an a ffect c oncept arrang ement , concepts are
believ ed to b e arrang ed hierarchic ally in the mind (Anderson & R eder, 1999; J ohnson & Mer vis, 1997, 1998;
Palmer , Jones , Hennes sy, Unz e, & Pick , 1989; R osch , Mer vis, Gra y, Johnson , & Bo yes-Braem , 1976; T anaka &
Taylor , 1991). R elated concepts are link ed, and the s trength o f the link dep ends on ho w often tw o concepts
have been as sociated.
Semantic netw orks diff er dep ending on p ersonal e xperienc es. Imp ortantly f or memor y, activ ating an y part of a
semantic netw ork also activ ates the c oncepts link ed to tha t part to a les ser degree . The pro cess is kno wn as
spre ading activ ation (C ollins & Lo ftus , 1975). If one p art of a netw ork is activ ated, it is e asier to ac cess the
associated concepts b ecause the y are alre ady p artially activ ated. When y ou rememb er or rec all something ,
you activ ate a c oncept, and the rela ted concepts are more e asily rememb ered because the y are p artially
activ ated. Ho wever, the activ ations do not spre ad in jus t one direction . When y ou rememb er something , you
usually ha ve sev eral routes to g et the inf orma tion y ou are tr ying to ac cess, and the more links y ou ha ve to a
concept, the b etter y our chanc es o f rememb ering .
There are tw o typ es o f long-term memor y:explicit and implicit (Figure 8.6 ). Unders tanding the diff erenc e
between e xplicit memor y and implicit memor y is imp ortant b ecause a ging , particular typ es o f brain tra uma,
and c ertain disorders c an imp act e xplicit and implicit memor y in diff erent w ays.Explicit memories are those
we consciously tr y to rememb er, rec all, and rep ort. For e xample , if y ou are s tudying f or y our chemis try exam ,
the ma terial y ou are le arning will b e part of your e xplicit memor y. In k eeping with the c omputer analog y, some
informa tion in y our long-term memor y would b e lik e the inf orma tion y ou ha ve sa ved on the hard driv e. It is
not there on y our desk top ( your shor t-term memor y), but mos t of the time y ou c an pull up this inf orma tion
when y ou w ant it . Not all long-term memories are s trong memories , and some memories c an only b e rec alled
using prompts . For e xample , you might e asily rec all a fact , such as the c apital o f the Unite d Sta tes, but y ou
might s truggle to rec all the name o f the res taurant a t which y ou had dinner when y ou visite d a ne arby city las t
summer . A prompt , such as tha t the res taurant w as name d after its o wner , might help y ou rec all the name o f
the res taurant . Explicit memor y is sometimes ref erre d to as declara tive memor y, because it c an b e put into
words . Explicit memor y is divide d into episo dic memor y and semantic memor y.

about ho w memories are s tore d and retriev ed.
Episo dic memor yis inf orma tion a bout ev ents w e ha ve personally e xperienc ed (i.e., an episo de). F or ins tanc e,
the memor y of your las t bir thda y is an episo dic memor y. Usually , episo dic memor y is rep orted as a s tory. The
concept o f episo dic memor y was firs t prop osed about in the 1970s ( Tulving , 1972). Sinc e then , Tulving and
others ha ve ref ormula ted the theor y, and currently scientis ts believ e tha t episo dic memor y is memor y about
happ enings in p articular plac es a t particular times —the wha t, where , and when o f an ev ent ( Tulving , 2002). It
involves rec ollection o f visual ima gery as w ell as the f eeling o f familiarity (Has sabis & Ma guire , 2007).
Semant ic memor yis kno wledge about w ords , concepts , and langua ge-based kno wledge and facts . Semantic
memor y is typic ally rep orted as facts . Semantic me ans ha ving to do with langua ge and kno wledge about
langua ge. For e xample , ans wers to the f ollowing ques tions lik e “wha t is the definition o f psycholog y” and “ who
was the firs t Afric an Americ an president o f the Unite d Sta tes” are s tore d in y our semantic memor y.
Implicit memories are long-term memories tha t are not p art of our c onsciousnes s. Although implicit
memories are le arne d outside o f our a warenes s and c annot b e consciously rec alled, implicit memor y is
demons trated in the p erformanc e of some task (R oediger, 1990; Schacter , 1987). Implicit memor y has b een

studie d with c ognitiv e demand tasks , such as p erformanc e on ar tificial grammars (R eber, 1976), w ord memor y
(Jacoby, 1983; J acoby & W ithersp oon, 1982), and le arning unsp oken and un writ ten c onting encies and r ules
(Greensp oon, 1955; Giddan & Eriksen , 1959; K rieckha us & Eriksen , 1960). R eturning to the c omputer
metaphor , implicit memories are lik e a program r unning in the b ackground , and y ou are not a ware o f their
influenc e. Implicit memories c an influenc e obser vable b ehaviors as w ell as c ognitiv e tasks . In either c ase, you
usually c annot put the memor y into w ords tha t ade qua tely describ e the task . There are sev eral typ es o f
implicit memories , including pro cedural , priming , and emotional c onditioning .
FIGURE 8.6 Ther e are tw o components o f long-t erm memor y: explicit and implicit. Explicit memor y includes
episodic and semantic memor y. Implicit memor y includes pr ocedur al memor y and things learned thr ough
conditioning .
Implicit procedural memor yis often s tudie d using obser vable b ehaviors (A dams , 1957; Lac ey & Smith , 1954;
Lazar us & McCle ary, 1951). Implicit pro cedural memor y stores inf orma tion a bout the w ay to do something ,
and it is the memor y for skille d actions , such as br ushing y our teeth , riding a bicy cle, or driving a c ar. You w ere
prob ably not tha t good at riding a bicy cle or driving a c ar the firs t time y ou trie d, but y ou w ere much b etter
after doing those things f or a y ear. Your impro ved bicy cle riding w as due to le arning b alancing a bilities . You
likelythought about s taying upright in the b eginning , but no w you jus tdoit. Moreo ver, you prob ably are g ood
at staying b alanc ed, but c annot tell someone the e xact w ay you do it . Similarly , when y ou firs t learne d to driv e,
you prob ably thought a bout a lot o f things tha t you jus t do no w without much thought . When y ou firs t learne d
to do these tasks , someone ma y ha ve told y ou ho w to do them , but ev erything y ou le arne d sinc e those
instructions tha t you c annot re adily e xplain to someone else as the w ay to do it is implicit memor y.
Implicit priming is another typ e of implicit memor y (Schacter , 1992). During priming e xposure to a s timulus
affects the resp onse to a la ter s timulus . Stimuli c an v ary and ma y include w ords , pictures , and other s timuli to
elicit a resp onse or incre ase rec ognition . For ins tanc e, some p eople re ally enjo y picnics . The y love going into
nature , spre ading a blank et on the ground , and e ating a delicious me al. Now, unscramble the f ollowing let ters
to mak e a w ord.
Wha t word did y ou c ome up with? Chanc es are g ood tha t it w as "pla te."
Had y ou re ad, “Some p eople re ally enjo y gro wing flo wers. The y love going outside to their g arden , fertilizing
their plants , and w atering their flo wers,” you prob ably w ould ha ve come up with the w ord "p etal" ins tead o f8.1 • Ho w Memor y Functions 253
plate.
Do y ou rec all the e arlier discus sion o f semantic netw orks? The re ason p eople are more lik ely to c ome up with
“pla te” after re ading a bout a picnic is tha t pla te is as sociated (link ed) with picnic . Pla te w as prime d by
activ ating the semantic netw ork. Similarly , “petal” is link ed to flo wer and is prime d by flo wer. Priming is also
the re ason y ou prob ably said jelly in resp onse to p eanut but ter.
Implicit emotional c onditioning is the typ e of memor y involved in clas sically c onditione d emotion resp onses
(Olson & F azio , 2001). These emotional rela tionships c annot b e rep orted or rec alled but c an b e as sociated with
different s timuli . For e xample , specific smells c an c ause sp ecific emotional resp onses f or some p eople . If there
is a smell tha t mak es y ou f eel p ositiv e and nos talgic , and y ou don 't kno w where tha t resp onse c omes from , it is
an implicit emotional resp onse . Similarly , mos t people ha ve a song tha t causes a sp ecific emotional resp onse .
Tha t song 's eff ect c ould b e an implicit emotional memor y (Yang , Xu, Du , Shi , & F ang , 2011).

Episodic memories ar e also cal led aut obiogr aphical memories . Let’s quickl y test your aut obiogr aphical memor y.

Recognit ion happ ens when y ou identif y inf orma tion tha t you ha ve previously le arne d after enc ountering it

LEARNING OBJEC TIVES
By the end o f this section, y ou wil l be able t o:
•Explain the br ain functions in volved in memor y
•Recogniz e the r oles o f the hippocampus , am ygdala , and c erebel lum
Are memories s tore d in jus t one p art of the brain , or are the y store d in man y diff erent p arts of the brain? K arl
Lashle y began e xploring this problem , about 100 y ears a go, by making lesions in the brains o f animals such as
rats and monk eys. He w as se arching f or evidenc e of the engram : the group o f neurons tha t ser ve as the
“physical representa tion o f memor y” (Josselyn , 2010). F irst, Lashle y (1950) traine d ra ts to find their w ay
through a maz e. Then , he use d the to ols a vailable a t the time —in this c ase a soldering iron—to cre ate lesions in
the ra ts’ brains , specific ally in the c erebral c ortex. He did this b ecause he w as tr ying to erase the engram , or
the original memor y trac e tha t the ra ts had o f the maz e.
Lashle y did not find evidenc e of the engram , and the ra ts w ere s till a ble to find their w ay through the maz e,
regardles s of the siz e or lo cation o f the lesion . Base d on his cre ation o f lesions and the animals’ re action , he
formula ted the equip otent ialit y hypothesis : if p art of one are a of the brain in volved in memor y is dama ged,
another p art of the same are a can tak e over tha t memor y function (Lashle y, 1950). A lthough Lashle y’s early
work did not c onfirm the e xistenc e of the engram , mo dern ps ychologis ts are making progres s locating it . For
example , Eric K andel has sp ent dec ades s tudying the s ynapse and its role in c ontrolling the flo w of inf orma tion
through neural circuits nee ded to s tore memories (Ma yford, Sieg elbaum, & K andel , 2012).
Man y scientis ts believ e tha t the entire brain is in volved with memor y. Ho wever, sinc e Lashle y’s rese arch , other
scientis ts ha ve been a ble to lo ok more closely a t the brain and memor y. The y ha ve argue d tha t memor y is
located in sp ecific p arts of the brain , and sp ecific neurons c an b e rec ogniz ed for their in volvement in f orming
memories . The main p arts of the brain in volved with memor y are the am ygdala, the hipp ocampus , the
cereb ellum , and the prefrontal c ortex (Figure 8.8 ).8.2 • P arts of the Br ain In volved with Memor y255
FIGURE 8.8 The am ygdala is in volved in f ear and f ear memories . The hippocampus is as sociat ed with declar ative
and episodic memor y as w ell as r ecognition memor y. The c erebel lum pla ys a r ole in pr ocessing pr ocedur al
memories , such as ho w to pla y the piano . The pr efrontal c ortex appears t o be in volved in r emembering semantic
task s.
The Amygdala
First, let’s look a t the role o f the amygdala in memor y forma tion . The main job o f the am ygdala is to regula te
emotions , such as f ear and a ggres sion ( Figure 8.8 ). The am ygdala pla ys a p art in ho w memories are s tore d
because s tora ge is influenc ed by stres s hormones . For e xample , one rese archer e xperimente d with ra ts and
the f ear resp onse (J osselyn , 2010). U sing P avlovian c onditioning , a neutral tone w as p aire d with a f oot sho ck to
the ra ts. This pro duced a f ear memor y in the ra ts. After b eing c onditione d, each time the y he ard the tone , the y
would free ze (a def ense resp onse in ra ts), indic ating a memor y for the imp ending sho ck. Then the rese archers
induc ed cell de ath in neurons in the la teral am ygdala, which is the sp ecific are a of the brain resp onsible f or
fear memories . The y found the f ear memor y fade d (became e xtinct). Bec ause o f its role in pro cessing
emotional inf orma tion , the am ygdala is also in volved in memor y consolida tion: the pro cess of trans ferring
new le arning into long-term memor y. The am ygdala seems to facilita te enc oding memories a t a deep er lev el
when the ev ent is emotionally arousing .

lost the a bility to f orm new memories , yet he c ould s till rememb er inf orma tion and ev ents tha t had o ccurre d
prior to the surg ery.
The Cer ebellum and Pr efrontal Corte x
Although the hipp ocampus seems to b e more o f a pro cessing are a for e xplicit memories , you c ould s till lose it
and b e able to cre ate implicit memories (pro cedural memor y, motor le arning , and clas sical conditioning ),
thanks to y our cereb ellum (Figure 8.8 ). For e xample , one clas sical conditioning e xperiment is to ac custom
subjects to blink when the y are giv en a puff o f air to the e yes. When rese archers dama ged the c ereb ellums o f
rabbits , the y disc overed tha t the ra bbits w ere not a ble to le arn the c onditione d eye-blink resp onse (Steinmetz,
1999; Green & W oodruff-Pak, 2000).
Other rese archers ha ve use d brain sc ans, including p ositron emis sion tomograph y (PET ) scans, to le arn ho w
people pro cess and retain inf orma tion . From these s tudies , it seems the prefrontal c ortex is in volved. In one
study , particip ants had to c omplete tw o diff erent tasks: either lo oking f or the let terain w ords (c onsidere d a
perceptual task) or c ategorizing a noun as either living or non-living (c onsidere d a semantic task) (K apur et al .,
1994). P articip ants w ere then ask ed which w ords the y had previously seen . Recall w as much b etter f or the
semantic task than f or the p erceptual task . According to PET sc ans, there w as much more activ ation in the left
inferior prefrontal c ortex in the semantic task . In another s tudy , enc oding w as as sociated with left frontal
activity , while retriev al of inf orma tion w as as sociated with the right frontal region (C raik et al ., 1999).
Neur otransmitters
There also app ear to b e sp ecific neurotransmit ters in volved with the pro cess of memor y, such as epinephrine ,
dop amine , serotonin , glutama te, and ac etylcholine (Myhrer , 2003). There c ontinues to b e discus sion and
deb ate among rese archers as to which neurotransmit terplays which sp ecific role (Blo ckland , 1996). A lthough
we don ’t yet kno w which role e ach neurotransmit ter pla ys in memor y, we do kno w tha t communic ation among
neurons via neurotransmit ters is critic al for dev eloping new memories . Repeated activity b y neurons le ads to
incre ased neurotransmit ters in the s ynapses and more efficient and more s ynaptic c onnections . This is ho w
memor y consolida tion o ccurs .
It is also b eliev ed tha t strong emotions trigg er the f orma tion o f strong memories , and w eaker emotional
experienc es form w eaker memories; this is c alledarousal theor y(Chris tianson , 1992). F or e xample , strong
emotional e xperienc es c an trigg er the rele ase o f neurotransmit ters , as w ell as hormones , which s trengthen
memor y; theref ore, our memor y for an emotional ev ent is usually b etter than our memor y for a non-emotional
event. When humans and animals are s tres sed, the brain secretes more o f the neurotransmit ter glutama te,
which helps them rememb er the s tres sful ev ent (McG augh , 2003). This is cle arly evidenc ed by wha t is kno wn
as the flashbulb memor y phenomenon .
Aflashbulb memor yis an e xceptionally cle ar rec ollection o f an imp ortant ev ent ( Figure 8.9 ). Man y people
who ha ve liv ed through his toric and momentous ev ents c an rec all e xactly where the y were and ho w the y he ard
about them . For e xample , a P ew R esearch C enter (2011) sur vey found tha t for those Americ ans who w ere a ge 8
or older a t the time o f 9/11 terroris t attacks , 97% c an rec all the moment the y learne d of this ev ent, even a

work b y more rec ent rese archers , such a widely share d ev ent is not re quire d (Hirs t & Phelps , 2016). F amily
memb ers might alw ays rememb er ho w the y he ard a bout an imp ortant ev ent in their liv es, or p eople in a
scho ol ma y rec all ne arly ev erything a bout the w ay the y experienc ed a major ev ent in tha t set ting . And
although mos t studies (and man y conversa tions) in volve neg ative memories , positiv e ev ents c an also elicit
flashbulb memories .8.2 • P arts of the Br ain In volved with Memor y257

Inaccur ate and F alse Memories
Even flashbulb memories f or impor tant e vents can ha ve decr eased ac curacy with the pas sage of time . For
example , on at leas t thr ee oc casions , when ask ed ho w he hear d about the t errorist attack s of 9/11, P resident
Geor ge W. Bush r esponded inac curately. In Januar y 2002, les s than 4 months aft er the at tack s, the then sit ting
President Bush w as ask ed ho w he hear d about the at tack s. He r esponded:
I was sit ting ther e, and m y Chief o f Staff— well, firs t of all, when w e walked int o the clas sroom, I had
seen this plane fl y int o the firs t building . Ther e was a T V set on. And y ou kno w, I thought it w as pilot
error and I w as amaz ed that an ybody c ould mak e such a t errible mis take. (Gr eenber g, 2004, p . 2)
Contr ary to what P resident Bush s tated, no one sa w the firs t plane hit, e xcept people on the gr ound near the twin
towers. Video f ootag e of the firs t plane w as not r ecorded because it w as a normal T uesda y morning , until the firs t
plane hit.
Memor y is not lik e a video r ecording . Human memor y, even flashbulb memories , can be fr ail. Diff erent par ts of
them, such as the time , visual elements , and smel ls, are stored in diff erent plac es. When something is
remember ed, these c omponents ha ve to be put back t ogether f or the c omplet e memor y, which is kno wn as
memor y reconstruction. Each c omponent cr eates a chanc e for an err or to oc cur. False memor y is r emembering
something that did not happen. R esear ch par ticipants ha ve recal led hearing a w ord, even though the y ne ver

However, all o f us ha ve at times f elt fr ustrated, and ev en emb arras sed, when our memories ha ve faile d us .
There are sev eral re asons wh y this happ ens.
Amnesia
Amnesia is the los s of long-term memor y tha t occurs as the result o f dise ase, physical tra uma, or
psychologic al tra uma. Endel T ulving (2002) and his c olleagues a t the Univ ersity o f Toronto s tudie d K. C. for
years. K. C. suff ered a tra uma tic he ad injur y in a motorcy cle ac cident and then had sev ere amnesia. T ulving
writes ,
the outs tanding fact a bout K .C.'s mental mak e-up is his ut ter ina bility to rememb er an y ev ents ,
circums tanc es, or situa tions from his o wn lif e. His episo dic amnesia c overs his whole lif e, from bir th
to the present . The only e xception is the e xperienc es tha t, at an y time , he has had in the las t minute or
two. (Tulving , 2002, p . 14)
Anter ogr ade Amnesia
There are tw o common typ es o f amnesia: anterograde amnesia and retrograde amnesia ( Figure 8.10 ).
Anterograde amnesia is c ommonly c aused by brain tra uma, such as a blo w to the he ad. Withanterograde
amnesia , you c annot rememb er new inf orma tion , although y ou c an rememb er inf orma tion and ev ents tha t
happ ened prior to y our injur y. The hipp ocampus is usually a ffecte d (McLeo d, 2011). This sugg ests tha t
dama ge to the brain has resulte d in the ina bility to trans fer inf orma tion from shor t-term to long-term
memor y; tha t is, the ina bility to c onsolida te memories .
Man y people with this f orm o f amnesia are una ble to f orm new episo dic or semantic memories , but are s till
able to f orm new pro cedural memories (Ba yley & Squire , 2002). This w as tr ue o f H. M., which w as discus sed
earlier . The brain dama ge caused by his surg ery resulte d in anterograde amnesia. H. M. w ould re ad the same
magazine o ver and o ver, having no memor y of ever re ading it —it w as alw ays new to him . He also c ould not
rememb er p eople he had met a fter his surg ery. If y ou w ere intro duced to H. M. and then y ou left the ro om f or a
few minutes , he w ould not kno w you up on y our return and w ould intro duce himself to y ou a gain. Ho wever,
when presente d the same puzzle sev eral da ys in a ro w, although he did not rememb er ha ving seen the puzzle
before, his sp eed at solving it b ecame fas ter e ach da y (because o f rele arning ) (Corkin , 1965, 1968).
FIGURE 8.10 This diagr am il lustrates the timeline o f retrograde and ant erograde amnesia . Memor y problems that
extend back in time bef ore the injur y and pr event r etrie val of information pr eviousl y stored in long-t erm memor y are
known as r etrograde amnesia . Con versel y, memor y problems that e xtend f orward in time fr om the point o f injur y
and pr event the f ormation o f new memories ar e cal led ant erograde amnesia .8.3 • P roblems with Memor y259
Retrogr ade Amnesia
Retrograde amnesia is los s of memor y for ev ents tha t occurre d prior to the tra uma. P eople with retrograde
amnesia c annot rememb er some or ev en all o f their p ast. The y ha ve difficulty rememb ering episo dic
memories . Wha t if y ou w oke up in the hospital one da y and there w ere p eople surrounding y our b ed claiming
to b e your sp ouse , your children , and y our p arents? The trouble is y ou don ’t rec ogniz e an y of them . You w ere in
a car ac cident , suff ered a he ad injur y, and no w ha ve retrograde amnesia. Y ou don ’t rememb er an ything a bout
your lif e prior to w aking up in the hospital . This ma y sound lik e the s tuff o f Holly wood mo vies , and Holly wood
has b een fascina ted with the amnesia plot f or ne arly a c entur y, going all the w ay back to the film Garden o f Lies
from 1915 to more rec ent mo vies such as the J ason Bourne sp y thrillers . Ho wever, for re al-lif e suff erers o f
retrograde amnesia, lik e former NFL f ootball pla yer Sc ott Bolzan , the s tory is not a Holly wood mo vie. Bolzan
fell, hit his he ad, and delete d 46 y ears o f his lif e in an ins tant . He is no w living with one o f the mos t extreme

Memory Construction and R econstruction
The f ormula tion o f new memories is sometimes c alledcons truction, and the pro cess of bringing up old
memories is c alledrecons truction. Yet as w e retriev e our memories , we also tend to alter and mo dify them . A
memor y pulle d from long-term s tora ge into shor t-term memor y is fle xible . New ev ents c an b e adde d and w e
can chang e wha t we think w e rememb er a bout p ast events , resulting in inac curacies and dis tortions . People
may not intend to dis tort facts , but it c an happ en in the pro cess of retrieving old memories and c ombining
them with new memories (R oediger & De Soto , 2015).
Suggestibility
When someone witnes ses a crime , tha t person ’s memor y of the details o f the crime is v ery imp ortant in
catching the susp ect. Bec ause memor y is so fra gile, witnes ses c an b e easily (and o ften ac cidentally ) misle d due
to the problem o f sugg estibility .Sugg estibilit ydescrib es the eff ects o f misinf orma tion from e xternal sourc es
that leads to the cre ation o f false memories . In the fall o f 2002, a snip er in the D C are a shot p eople a t a g as
station , leaving Home Dep ot, and w alking do wn the s treet . These a ttacks w ent on in a v ariety o f plac es for o ver
three w eeks and resulte d in the de aths o f ten p eople . During this time , as y ou c an ima gine , people w ere
terrifie d to le ave their homes , go shopping , or ev en w alk through their neighb orho ods. Police officers and the
FBI w orked frantic ally to solv e the crimes , and a tip hotline w as set up . Law enf orcement rec eived over 140,000
tips , which resulte d in appro xima tely 35,000 p ossible susp ects (N ewseum , n.d.).
Mos t of the tips w ere de ad ends , until a white v an w as sp otted at the site o f one o f the sho otings . The p olice
chief w ent on na tional television with a picture o f the white v an. After the new s conferenc e, sev eral other
eyewitnes ses c alled to sa y tha t the y too had seen a white v an fleeing from the sc ene o f the sho oting . At the
time , there w ere more than 70,000 white v ans in the are a. Police officers, as w ell as the g eneral public , focuse d
almos t exclusiv ely on white v ans b ecause the y believ ed the e yewitnes ses. Other tips w ere ignore d. When the
susp ects w ere finally c aught , the y were driving a blue se dan .
As illus trated by this e xample , we are vulnera ble to the p ower o f sugg estion , simply b ased on something w e see
on the new s. Or w e can claim to rememb er something tha t in fact is only a sugg estion someone made . It is the
sugg estion tha t is the c ause o f the false memor y.
Eyewitness Misidentification
Even though memor y and the pro cess of rec onstruction c an b e fra gile, police officers, prosecutors , and the
260 8 • Memor y
Access for fr ee a t opens tax. org
courts often rely on e yewitnes s identific ation and tes timon y in the prosecution o f criminals . Ho wever, faulty
eyewitnes s identific ation and tes timon y can le ad to wrongful c onvictions ( Figure 8.11 ).
FIGURE 8.11 In studying cases wher e DNA e videnc e has e xoner ated people fr om crimes , the Innoc ence Project
disc overed that e yewitnes s misidentification is the leading cause o f wrongful c onvictions (Benjamin N. Car dozo
School o f Law, Yeshiv a Univ ersity , 2009).
How do es this happ en? In 1984, J ennif er Thompson , then a 22- year-old c olleg e student in N orth C arolina, w as
brutally rap ed at knif epoint . As she w as b eing rap ed, she trie d to memoriz e ev ery detail o f her rapis t’s fac e and
physical characteris tics, vowing tha t if she sur vived, she w ould help g et him c onvicte d. After the p olice were
contacte d, a c omp osite sk etch w as made o f the susp ect, and J ennif er w as sho wn six photos . She chose tw o, one
of which w as o f Ronald C otton. After lo oking a t the photos f or 4–5 minutes , she said , “Yeah. This is the one ,”
and then she adde d, “I think this is the guy .” When ques tione d about this b y the detectiv e who ask ed, “You’re
sure? P ositiv e?” She said tha t it w as him . Then she ask ed the detectiv e if she did OK , and he reinf orced her
choic e by telling her she did gre at. These kinds o f unintende d cues and sugg estions b y police officers c an le ad
witnes ses to identif y the wrong susp ect. The dis trict a ttorne y was c oncerne d about her lack o f certainty the
first time , so she view ed a lineup o f sev en men . She said she w as tr ying to decide b etween numb ers 4 and 5,
finally deciding tha t Cotton, numb er 5, “Lo oks mos t lik e him .” He w as 22 y ears old .
By the time the trial b egan, Jennif er Thompson had a bsolutely no doubt tha t she w as rap ed by Ronald C otton.
She tes tifie d at the c ourt he aring , and her tes timon y was c omp elling enough tha t it help ed convict him . Ho w
did she g o from , “I think it ’s the guy ” and it “Lo oks mos t lik e him ,” to such c ertainty? G ary Wells and De ah
Quinliv an (2009) as sert it’s sugg estive police identific ation pro cedures , such as s tacking lineups to mak e the
defendant s tand out , telling the witnes s which p erson to identif y, and c onfirming witnes ses choic es b y telling
them “ Good choic e,” or “ You pick ed the guy .”
After C otton w as c onvicte d of the rap e, he w as sent to prison f or lif e plus 50 y ears. After 4 y ears in prison , he
was a ble to g et a new trial . Jennif er Thompson onc e again tes tifie d agains t him . This time R onald C otton w as
given tw o lif e sentenc es. After ser ving 11 y ears in prison , DN A evidenc e finally demons trated tha t Ronald
Cotton did not c ommit the rap e, was inno cent, and had ser ved over a dec ade in prison f or a crime he did not

Preserving Ey ewitness Memory : The Eliz abeth Smart Case
Contr ast the Cot ton case with what happened in the Elizabeth Smar tcase . When Elizabeth w as 14 y ears old and
fast asleep in her bed at home , she w as abduct ed at knif epoint. Her nine -year-old sis ter, Mar y Katherine , was
sleeping in the same bed and w atched, t errified, as her belo ved older sis ter w as abduct ed. Mar y Katherine w as
the sole e yewitnes s to this crime and w as very fearful. In the f ollowing w eeks, the Sal t Lake City polic e and the
FBI pr oceeded with caution with Mar y Katherine . The y did not w ant t o implant an y false memories or mislead her
in an y way. The y did not sho w her polic e line -ups or push her t o do a c omposit e sk etch o f the abduct or. The y
knew if the y corrup ted her memor y, Elizabeth might ne ver be f ound. F or se veral months , ther e was lit tle or no

home) and then she w as able t o name the person whose v oice it w as. The famil y contact ed the pr ess and others
recogniz ed him—aft er a t otal o f nine months , the suspect w as caught and Elizabeth Smar t was returned t o her

The Misinf ormation Eff ect
Cognitiv e ps ychologis t Eliza beth Lo ftus has c onducte d extensiv e rese arch on memor y. She has s tudie d false
memories as w ell as rec overed memories o f childho od se xual a buse . Loftus also dev elop ed the
misinf ormat ion eff ect p aradigm , which holds tha t after e xposure to additional and p ossibly inac cura te
informa tion , a p erson ma y misrememb er the original ev ent.
According to Lo ftus , an e yewitnes s’s memor y of an ev ent is v ery fle xible due to the misinf orma tion eff ect. To
test this theor y, Loftus and J ohn P almer (1974) ask ed 45 U .S. c olleg e students to es tima te the sp eed of cars
using diff erent f orms o f ques tions ( Figure 8.12 ). The p articip ants w ere sho wn films o f car ac cidents and w ere

Contr oversies over R epr essed and R ecover ed Memories
Other rese archers ha ve describ ed ho w whole ev ents , not jus t words , can b e falsely rec alled, even when the y did
not happ en. The ide a tha t memories o f tra uma tic ev ents c ould b e repres sed has b een a theme in the field o f
psycholog y, beginning with Sigmund F reud , and the c ontro versy surrounding the ide a continues to day.
Recall o f false a utobiographic al memories is c alledfalse memor y syndrome . This s yndrome has rec eived a lot
of publicity , particularly as it rela tes to memories o f events tha t do not ha ve indep endent witnes ses—often the
only witnes ses to the a buse are the p erpetra tor and the victim (e .g., se xual a buse).
On one side o f the deb ate are those who ha ve rec overed memories o f childho od abuse y ears a fter it o ccurre d.
These rese archers argue tha t some children ’s experienc es ha ve been so tra uma tizing and dis tres sing tha t the y
mus t lock those memories a way in order to le ad some semblanc e of a normal lif e. The y believ e tha t repres sed
memories c an b e locked away for dec ades and la ter rec alled intact through h ypnosis and guide d ima gery
techniques (Devilly , 2007).
Research sugg ests tha t ha ving no memor y of childho od se xual a buse is quite c ommon in adults . For ins tanc e,
one larg e-scale s tudy c onducte d by John Briere and J on C onte (1993) rev ealed tha t 59% o f 450 men and
women who w ere rec eiving tre atment f or se xual a buse tha t had o ccurre d before a ge 18 had f orgotten their
experienc es. Ross Cheit (2007) sugg ested tha t repres sing these memories cre ated ps ychologic al dis tres s in
adultho od. The R ecovered Memor y Project w as cre ated so tha t victims o f childho od se xual a buse c an rec all
these memories and allo w the he aling pro cess to b egin (Cheit , 2007; Devilly , 2007).
On the other side , Loftus has challeng ed the ide a tha t individuals c an repres s memories o f tra uma tic ev ents
from childho od, including se xual a buse , and then rec over those memories y ears la ter through therap eutic
techniques such as h ypnosis , guide d visualiza tion , and a ge regres sion .
Loftus is not sa ying tha t childho od se xual a buse do esn’t happ en, but she do es ques tion whether or not those
memories are ac cura te, and she is sk eptic al of the ques tioning pro cess use d to ac cess these memories , giv en
that even the slightes t sugg estion from the therapis t can le ad to misinf orma tion eff ects . For e xample ,
rese archers Stephen C eci and Ma ggie Br ucks (1993, 1995) ask ed three -year-old children to use an
anatomic ally c orrect doll to sho w where their p ediatricians had touche d them during an e xam . Fifty-five
percent o f the children p ointe d to the g enital/anal are a on the dolls , even when the y had not rec eived an y form
of genital e xam .8.3 • P roblems with Memor y263
Ever sinc e Lo ftus publishe d her firs t studies on the sugg estibility o f eyewitnes s tes timon y in the 1970s , social
scientis ts, police officers, therapis ts, and leg al practitioners ha ve been a ware o f the fla ws in inter view
practic es. Conse quently , steps ha ve been tak en to decre ase sugg estibility o f witnes ses. One w ay is to mo dify
how witnes ses are ques tione d. When inter view ers use neutral and les s leading langua ge, children more
accura tely rec all wha t happ ened and who w as in volved (Go odman , 2006; Pip e, 1996; Pip e, Lamb , Orb ach, &
Esplin , 2004). Another chang e is in ho w police lineups are c onducte d. It’s rec ommende d tha t a blind photo
lineup b e use d. This w ay the p erson adminis tering the lineup do esn’t kno w which photo b elongs to the
susp ect, minimizing the p ossibility o f giving le ading cues . Additionally , judg es in some s tates no w inf orm
jurors a bout the p ossibility o f misidentific ation . Judg es c an also suppres s eyewitnes s tes timon y if the y deem it
unrelia ble.
Forgetting
“I’ve a grand memor y for forgetting ,” quipp ed Robert Louis Stev enson .Forgetting refers to los s of inf orma tion
from long-term memor y. We all f orget things , like a lo ved one ’s bir thda y, someone ’s name , or where w e put our
car k eys. As y ou’ve come to see , memor y is fra gile, and f orgetting c an b e frustrating and ev en emb arras sing .

Encoding F ailur e
Sometimes memor y los s happ ens b efore the actual memor y pro cess begins , which is enc oding failure . We
can’t rememb er something if w e nev er store d it in our memor y in the firs t plac e. This w ould b e lik e trying to
find a b ook on y our e -reader tha t you nev er actually purchase d and do wnlo aded. Often , in order to rememb er
something , we mus t pay attention to the details and activ ely w ork to pro cess the inf orma tion (eff ortful
encoding ). Lots o f times w e don ’t do this . For ins tanc e, think o f ho w man y times in y our lif e you’ve seen a
penn y. Can y ou ac cura tely rec all wha t the front o f a U .S. p enn y looks lik e? When rese archers Ra ymond
Nick erson and Marilyn A dams (1979) ask ed this ques tion , the y found tha t mos t Americ ans don ’t kno w which
one it is . The re ason is mos t lik ely enc oding failure . Mos t of us nev er enc ode the details o f the p enn y. We only
encode enough inf orma tion to b e able to dis tinguish it from other c oins . If w e don ’t enc ode the inf orma tion ,
then it ’s not in our long-term memor y, so w e will not b e able to rememb er it .

TABLE 8.1
Let’s look a t the firs t sin o f the f orgetting errors: transienc e, which me ans tha t memories c an fade o ver time .
Here ’s an e xample o f ho w this happ ens. Nathan ’s English te acher has as signe d his s tudents to re ad the no vel
To Kill a Mo ckingbird . Nathan c omes home from scho ol and tells his mom he has to re ad this b ook for clas s.
“Oh, I lo ved tha t book!” she sa ys. Nathan asks her wha t the b ook is a bout, and a fter some hesita tion she sa ys,
“Well . . . I kno w I re ad the b ook in high scho ol, and I rememb er tha t one o f the main characters is name d
Scout, and her fa ther is an a ttorne y, but I hones tly don ’t rememb er an ything else .” Nathan w onders if his
mother actually re ad the b ook, and his mother is surprise d she c an’t rec all the plot . Wha t is g oing on here is
stora ge dec ay: unuse d inf orma tion tends to fade with the p assage of time .
In 1885, German ps ychologis t Hermann Ebbingha usanalyz ed the pro cess of memoriza tion . First, he
memoriz ed lis ts of nonsense s yllables . Then he me asure d ho w much he le arne d (retaine d) when he a ttempte d
to rele arn e ach lis t. He tes ted himself o ver diff erent p erio ds o f time from 20 minutes la ter to 30 da ys later. The
result is his famous f orgetting cur ve (Figure 8.14 ). Due to s tora ge dec ay, an a verage person will lose 50% o f the
memoriz ed inf orma tion a fter 20 minutes and 70% o f the inf orma tion a fter 24 hours (Ebbingha us, 1885/1964).
Your memor y for new inf orma tion dec ays quickly and then ev entually lev els out .8.3 • P roblems with Memor y265

to at least one , if not all , of these e xamples —but don ’t worry, you are not alone . We are all prone to c ommit ting
the memor y error kno wn as absentminde dnes s, which describ es lapses in memor y caused by bre aks in
attention or our f ocus b eing somewhere else .
Cynthia, a ps ychologis t, rec alls a time when she rec ently c ommit ted the memor y error o f absentminde dnes s.
When I w as c ompleting c ourt-ordere d ps ychologic al ev alua tions , each time I w ent to the c ourt, I w as

wante d it to b e los t or b e pick ed up b y a criminal . At the end o f the da y, I w ould hand in m y temp orar y
identific ation . One da y, when I w as almos t done with an ev alua tion , my da ughter ’s da y care c alled and
said she w as sick and nee ded to b e pick ed up . It w as flu se ason , I didn ’t kno w ho w sick she w as, and I
was c oncerne d. I finishe d up the ev alua tion in the ne xt ten minutes , packed up m y brief case, and
rushe d to driv e to m y da ughter ’s da y care. After I pick ed up m y da ughter , I could not rememb er if I had

Now let ’s tak e a lo ok a t the three errors o f dis tortion: misa ttribution , sugg estibility , and bias .Misattribut ion
happ ens when y ou c onfuse the sourc e of your inf orma tion . Let ’s sa y Alejandra w as da ting L ucia and the y sa w
the firs t Hobbit mo vie tog ether . Then the y brok e up and A lejandra sa w the sec ond Hobbit mo vie with someone
else . Later tha t year, Alejandra and L ucia g et back tog ether . One da y, the y are discus sing ho w the Hobbit b ooks
and mo vies are diff erent and A lejandra sa ys to L ucia, “I lo ved watching the sec ond mo vie with y ou and seeing
you jump out o f your se at during tha t sup er sc ary part.” When L ucia resp onde d with a puzzle d and then angr y
look, Alejandra re alized she ’d commit ted the error o f misa ttribution .
Wha t if someone is a victim o f rap e shor tly a fter w atching a television program? Is it p ossible tha t the victim
could actually blame the rap e on the p erson she sa w on television b ecause o f misa ttribution? This is e xactly
wha t happ ened to Donald Thomson .
Australian e yewitnes s expert Donald Thomson app eared on a liv e TV discus sion a bout the
unrelia bility o f eyewitnes s memor y. He w as la ter arres ted, plac ed in a lineup and identifie d by a victim
as the man who had rap ed her . The p olice charg ed Thomson although the rap e had o ccurre d at the
time he w as on T V. The y dismis sed his alibi tha t he w as in plain view o f a T V audienc e and in the
comp any of the other discus sants , including an as sistant c ommis sioner o f police. . . . E ventually , the
investigators disc overed tha t the rapis t had a ttack ed the w oman as she w as w atching T V—the v ery
program on which Thomson had app eared. Authorities ev entually cle ared Thomson . The w oman had
confuse d the rapis t's fac e with the fac e tha t she had seen on T V. (Baddele y, 2004, p . 133)
The sec ond dis tortion error is sugg estibility . Sugg estibility is similar to misa ttribution , sinc e it also in volves
false memories , but it ’s diff erent . With misa ttribution y ou cre ate the false memor y entirely on y our o wn, which
is wha t the victim did in the Donald Thomson c ase a bove. With sugg estibility , it c omes from someone else ,
such as a therapis t or p olice inter view er asking le ading ques tions o f a witnes s during an inter view .
Memories c an also b e affecte d bybias , which is the final dis tortion error . Schacter (2001) sa ys tha t your
feelings and view o f the w orld c an actually dis tort your memor y of past events . There are sev eral typ es o f bias:8.3 • P roblems with Memor y267
•Stereotypic al bias in volves racial and g ender biases . For e xample , when Asian Americ an and Europ ean
Americ an rese arch p articip ants w ere presente d with a lis t of names , the y more fre quently inc orrectly
rememb ered typic al Afric an Americ an names such as J amal and T yrone to b e as sociated with the
occup ation b asketball pla yer, and the y more fre quently inc orrectly rememb ered typic al White names such
as Greg and Ho ward to b e as sociated with the o ccup ation o f politician (P ayne, Jacoby, & Lamb ert, 2004).
•Egocentric bias in volves enhancing our memories o f the p ast (Payne et al ., 2004). Did y ou re ally sc ore the
winning g oal in tha t big so ccer ma tch, or did y ou jus t assist?
•Hindsight bias happ ens when w e think an outc ome w as inevita ble a fter the fact . This is the “I knew it all
along ” phenomenon . The rec onstructiv e na ture o f memor y contributes to hindsight bias (C arli, 1999). W e
rememb er untr ue ev ents tha t seem to c onfirm tha t we knew the outc ome all along .
Have you ev er had a song pla y over and o ver in y our he ad? Ho w about a memor y of a tra uma tic ev ent,
something y ou re ally do not w ant to think a bout? When y ou k eep rememb ering something , to the p oint where
you c an’t “get it out o f your he ad” and it inter feres with y our a bility to c oncentra te on other things , it is c alled
persis tenc e. It’s Schacter ’s sev enth and las t memor y error . It’s actually a failure o f our memor y system
because w e involuntarily rec all un wante d memories , particularly unple asant ones ( Figure 8.16 ). For ins tanc e,
you witnes s a horrific c ar ac cident on the w ay to w ork one morning , and y ou c an’t concentra te on w ork

Interf erence
Sometimes inf orma tion is s tore d in our memor y, but f or some re ason it is inac cessible . This is kno wn as
inter ferenc e, and there are tw o typ es: pro activ e inter ferenc e and retro activ e inter ferenc e (Figure 8.17 ). Ha ve
you ev er g otten a new phone numb er or mo ved to a new addres s, but right a fter y ou tell p eople the old (and
wrong ) phone numb er or addres s? When the new y ear starts, do y ou find y ou ac cidentally write the previous

informa tion .Retro active inter ferenc ehapp ens when inf orma tion le arne d more rec ently hinders the rec all o f
older inf orma tion . For e xample , this w eek y ou are s tudying a bout memor y and le arn a bout the Ebbingha us

8.4 Ways to Enhance Memory
LEARNING OBJEC TIVES
By the end o f this section, y ou wil l be able t o:
•Recogniz e and appl y memor y-enhancing s trategies
•Recogniz e and appl y eff ectiv e study t echniques
Mos t of us suff er from memor y failures o f one kind or another , and mos t of us w ould lik e to impro ve our
memories so tha t we don ’t forget where w e put the c ar k eys or, more imp ortantly , the ma terial w e nee d to kno w
for an e xam . In this section , we’ll lo ok a t some w ays to help y ou rememb er b etter, and a t some s trategies f or
more eff ectiv e studying .
Memory-Enhancing Str ategies
Wha t are some ev eryday ways we can impro ve our memor y, including rec all? T o help mak e sure inf orma tion
goes from shor t-term memor y to long-term memor y, you c an use memor y-enhancing s trategies . One
strategy is rehe arsal , or the c onscious rep etition o f inf orma tion to b e rememb ered (C raik & W atkins , 1973).
Think a bout ho w you le arne d your multiplic ation ta bles as a child . You ma y rec all tha t 6 x 6 = 36, 6 x 7 = 42,
and 6 x 8 = 48. Memorizing these facts is rehe arsal .
Another s trategy is chunking : you org aniz e inf orma tion into mana geable bits or chunks (Bo die, Powers, &
Fitch-Ha user , 2006). Chunking is useful when tr ying to rememb er inf orma tion lik e da tes and phone numb ers.
Instead o f trying to rememb er 5205550467, y ou rememb er the numb er as 520-555-0467. So , if y ou met an
interes ting p erson a t a p arty and y ou w ante d to rememb er his phone numb er, you w ould na turally chunk it ,
and y ou c ould rep eat the numb er o ver and o ver, which is the rehe arsal s trategy.

You c ould also enhanc e memor y by using elab orat ive rehe arsal : a technique in which y ou think a bout the
meaning o f new inf orma tion and its rela tion to kno wledge alre ady s tore d in y our memor y (Tigner , 1999).
Elaborative rehe arsal in volves b oth linking the inf orma tion to kno wledge alre ady s tore d and rep eating the
informa tion . For e xample , in this c ase, you c ould rememb er tha t 520 is an are a code for Ariz ona and the
person y ou met is from Ariz ona. This w ould help y ou b etter rememb er the 520 prefix . If the inf orma tion is
8.4 • W ays to Enhanc e Memor y269
retaine d, it g oes into long-term memor y.
Mnemonic de vicesare memor y aids tha t help us org aniz e inf orma tion f or enc oding ( Figure 8.18 ). The y are
especially useful when w e want to rec all larg er bits o f inf orma tion such as s teps , stages, phases , and p arts of a
system (Belle zza, 1981). Brian nee ds to le arn the order o f the planets in the solar s ystem , but he ’s ha ving a
hard time rememb ering the c orrect order . His friend K elly sugg ests a mnemonic devic e tha t can help him
rememb er. Kelly tells Brian to simply rememb er the name Mr . VEM J . SUN , and he c an e asily rec all the c orrect
order o f the planets: Mercur y,Venus ,Earth,Mars,Jupiter ,Saturn ,Uranus , and Neptune . You might use a
mnemonic devic e to help y ou rememb er someone ’s name , a ma thema tical formula, or the order o f
mathema tical op erations .

If you ha ve ev er w atche d the television sho wModern F amily , you might ha ve seen Phil Dunph y explain ho w he

Dead t-shir t. Wha t’s a b and lik e the Gra teful De ad? Phish . Where do fish liv e? The o cean. Wha t else
lives in the o cean? C oral . Hello , Co-arl. (Wrubel & S piller , 2010)
It seems the more vivid or unusual the mnemonic , the e asier it is to rememb er. The k ey to using an y
mnemonic suc cessfully is to find a s trategy tha t works f or y ou.

Some other s trategies tha t are use d to impro ve memor y include e xpres sive writing and sa ying w ords aloud .
Expres sive writing helps b oost your shor t-term memor y, particularly if y ou write a bout a tra uma tic e xperienc e
in your lif e. Masao Y ogo and Shuji F ujihara (2008) had p articip ants write f or 20-minute inter vals sev eral times
per month . The p articip ants w ere ins tructe d to write a bout a tra uma tic e xperienc e, their b est possible future

Wha t if y ou w ant to rememb er items y ou nee d to pick up a t the s tore? Simply sa y them out loud to y ourself. A
series o f studies (MacLeo d, Gopie , Hourihan , Neary, & Ozubk o, 2010) f ound tha t saying a w ord out loud

How to Study Eff ectively
Base d on the inf orma tion presente d in this chapter , here are some s trategies and sugg estions to help y ou hone
your s tudy techniques ( Figure 8.19 ). The k ey with an y of these s trategies is to figure out wha t works b est for
you.
FIGURE 8.19 Memor y techniques can be useful when s tudying f or clas s. (credit: Barr y Pousman)
•Use elab orat ive rehe arsal : In a famous ar ticle , Fergus C raik and R obert Lo ckhar t (1972) discus sed their
belief tha t inf orma tion w e pro cess more deeply g oes into long-term memor y. Their theor y is c alledlevels
of pro cessing . If w e want to rememb er a piec e of inf orma tion , we should think a bout it more deeply and
link it to other inf orma tion and memories to mak e it more me aningful . For e xample , if w e are tr ying to
rememb er tha t the hipp ocampus is in volved with memor y pro cessing , we might en vision a hipp opotamus
with e xcellent memor y and then w e could b etter rememb er the hipp ocampus .
•Apply the self -ref erenc e eff ect: As y ou g o through the pro cess of ela borative rehe arsal , it w ould b e ev en
more b eneficial to mak e the ma terial y ou are tr ying to memoriz e personally me aningful to y ou. In other
words , mak e use o f the self -referenc e eff ect. Write notes in y our o wn w ords . Write definitions from the
text, and then rewrite them in y our o wn w ords . Relate the ma terial to something y ou ha ve alre ady le arne d
for another clas s, or think ho w you c an apply the c oncepts to y our o wn lif e. When y ou do this , you are
building a w eb o f retriev al cues tha t will help y ou ac cess the ma terial when y ou w ant to rememb er it .
•Use dis tribute d pract ice: Study acros s time in shor t dura tions ra ther than tr ying to cram it all in a t onc e.
Memor y consolida tion tak es time , and s tudying acros s time allo ws time f or memories to c onsolida te. In
addition , cramming c an c ause the links b etween c oncepts to b ecome so activ e tha t you g et stuck in a link ,
and it prev ents y ou from ac cessing the res t of the inf orma tion tha t you le arne d.
•Rehe arse , rehe arse , rehe arse : Review the ma terial o ver time , in sp aced and org aniz ed study ses sions .
Organiz e and s tudy y our notes , and tak e practic e quizz es/exams . Link the new inf orma tion to other
informa tion y ou alre ady kno w w ell.
•Study efficiently : Students are gre at highlighters , but highlighting is not v ery efficient b ecause s tudents
spend to o much time s tudying the things the y alre ady le arne d. Ins tead o f highlighting , use inde x cards .
Write the ques tion on one side and the ans wer on the other side . When y ou s tudy , sep arate your c ards into8.4 • W ays to Enhanc e Memor y271
those y ou g ot right and those y ou g ot wrong . Study the ones y ou g ot wrong and k eep sor ting . Eventually , all
your c ards will b e in the pile y ou ans wered correctly .
•Be a ware of inter ferenc e: To re duce the lik eliho od of inter ferenc e, study during a quiet time without
interr uptions or dis tractions ( like television or music).
•Keep mo ving : Of c ourse y ou alre ady kno w tha t exercise is g ood for y our b ody, but did y ou also kno w it’s
also g ood for y our mind? R esearch sugg ests tha t regular aerobic e xercise (an ything tha t gets y our he art
rate elev ated) is b eneficial f or memor y (van P raag, 2008). A erobic e xercise promotes neurog enesis: the
growth o f new brain c ells in the hipp ocampus , an are a of the brain kno wn to pla y a role in memor y and
learning .
•Get enough sleep : While y ou are sleeping , your brain is s till a t work. During sleep the brain org aniz es and
consolida tes inf orma tion to b e store d in long-term memor y (Ab el & Bä uml , 2013).
•Mak e use of mnemonic de vices: As y ou le arne d earlier in this chapter , mnemonic devic es o ften help us to
rememb er and rec all inf orma tion . There are diff erent typ es o f mnemonic devic es, such as the acron ym.
An acron ym is a w ord f orme d by the firs t let ter o f each o f the w ords y ou w ant to rememb er. For e xample ,
even if y ou liv e ne ar one , you might ha ve difficulty rec alling the names o f all fiv e Gre at Lak es. Wha t if I told
you to think o f the w ord Homes? HOMES is an acron ym tha t represents Huron , Ontario , Michig an, Erie ,
and Sup erior: the fiv e Gre at Lak es. Another typ e of mnemonic devic e is an acros tic: y ou mak e a phrase o f
all the firs t let ters o f the w ords . For e xample , if y ou are taking a ma th tes t and y ou are ha ving difficulty
rememb ering the order o f op erations , rec alling the f ollowing sentenc e will help y ou: “Ple ase Ex cuse My
Dear A unt Sally ,” because the order o f ma thema tical op erations is P arentheses , Exp onents , Multiplic ation ,
Division , Addition , Subtraction . There also are jingles , which are rh yming tunes tha t contain k ey words

Summary
8.1 How Memory Functions
Memor y is a s ystem or pro cess tha t stores wha t we learn f or future use .
Our memor y has three b asic functions: enc oding , storing , and retrieving inf orma tion . Enc oding is the act o f
getting inf orma tion into our memor y system through a utoma tic or eff ortful pro cessing . Stora ge is retention o f
the inf orma tion , and retriev al is the act o f getting inf orma tion out o f stora ge and into c onscious a warenes s
through rec all, rec ognition , and rele arning . The ide a tha t inf orma tion is pro cessed through three memor y
systems is c alled the A tkinson-Shiffrin mo del o f memor y. First, environmental s timuli enter our sensor y
memor y for a p erio d of les s than a sec ond to a f ew sec onds . Those s timuli tha t we notic e and p ay attention to
then mo ve into shor t-term memor y. According to the A tkinson-Shiffrin mo del, if w e rehe arse this inf orma tion ,
then it mo ves into long-term memor y for p ermanent s tora ge. Other mo dels lik e tha t of Baddele y and Hitch
sugg est there is more o f a feedback lo op b etween shor t-term memor y and long-term memor y. Long-term
memor y has a practic ally limitles s stora ge capacity and is divide d into implicit and e xplicit memor y.
8.2 Parts of the Br ain Involved with Memory
Beginning with K arl Lashle y, rese archers and ps ychologis ts ha ve been se arching f or the engram , which is the
physical trac e of memor y. Lashle y did not find the engram , but he did sugg est tha t memories are dis tribute d
throughout the entire brain ra ther than s tore d in one sp ecific are a. N ow w e kno w tha t three brain are as do pla y
signific ant roles in the pro cessing and s tora ge of diff erent typ es o f memories: c ereb ellum , hipp ocampus , and
amygdala. The c ereb ellum ’s job is to pro cess pro cedural memories; the hipp ocampus is where new memories
are enc oded; the am ygdala helps determine wha t memories to s tore , and it pla ys a p art in determining where
the memories are s tore d based on whether w e ha ve a s trong or w eak emotional resp onse to the ev ent. Strong
emotional e xperienc es c an trigg er the rele ase o f neurotransmit ters , as w ell as hormones , which s trengthen
memor y, so tha t memor y for an emotional ev ent is usually s trong er than memor y for a non-emotional ev ent.
This is sho wn b y wha t is kno wn as the flashbulb memor y phenomenon: our a bility to rememb er signific ant lif e
events . Ho wever, our memor y for lif e ev ents (a utobiographic al memor y) is not alw ays ac cura te.274 8 • Summar y

8.3 Problems with Memory
All of us a t times ha ve felt disma yed, frustrated, and ev en emb arras sed when our memories ha ve faile d us . Our
memor y is fle xible and prone to man y errors , which is wh y eyewitnes s tes timon y has b een f ound to b e larg ely
unrelia ble. There are sev eral re asons wh y forgetting o ccurs . In c ases o f brain tra uma or dise ase, forgetting ma y
be due to amnesia. Another re ason w e forget is due to enc oding failure . We can’t rememb er something if w e
never store d it in our memor y in the firs t plac e. Schacter presents sev en memor y errors tha t also c ontribute to
forgetting . Sometimes , inf orma tion is actually s tore d in our memor y, but w e cannot ac cess it due to
inter ferenc e. Proactiv e inter ferenc e happ ens when old inf orma tion hinders the rec all o f newly le arne d
informa tion . Retro activ e inter ferenc e happ ens when inf orma tion le arne d more rec ently hinders the rec all o f
older inf orma tion .
8.4 Ways to Enhance Memory
There are man y ways to c omb at the inevita ble failures o f our memor y system . Some c ommon s trategies tha t
can b e use d in ev eryday situa tions include mnemonic devic es, rehe arsal , self -referencing , and ade qua te sleep .
These same s trategies also c an help y ou to s tudy more eff ectiv ely.

A rainb ow in the sky:

Or let me die!
The Child is fa ther o f the Man;

Bound e ach to e ach b y na tural piety . (Words worth, 1802)
In this p oem, William W ords worth writes , “the child is fa ther o f the man .” Wha t do es this seemingly
incongr uous s tatement me an, and wha t do es it ha ve to do with lif espan dev elopment? W ords worth might b e
sugg esting tha t the p erson he is as an adult dep ends larg ely on the e xperienc es he had in childho od. Consider
the f ollowing ques tions: T o wha t extent is the adult y ou are to day influenc ed by the child y ou onc e were? T o
wha t extent is a child fundamentally diff erent from the adult he gro ws up to b e?
These are the typ es o f ques tions dev elopmental ps ychologis ts tr y to ans wer, by studying ho w humans chang e
and gro w from c onception through childho od, adolesc ence, adultho od, and de ath. The y view dev elopment as a
lifelong pro cess tha t can b e studie d scientific ally acros s three dev elopmental domains —ph ysical, cognitiv e,
and ps ychoso cial dev elopment .Physical de velopment involves gro wth and chang es in the b ody and brain , the
senses , motor skills , and he alth and w ellnes s.Cognit ive de velopment involves le arning , attention , memor y,
langua ge, thinking , reasoning , and cre ativity .Psychoso cial de velopment involves emotions , personality , and
social rela tionships . We ref er to these domains throughout the chapter .
Resear ch Methods in Dev elopmental Psy chology
You’ve learned about a v ariety o f resear ch methods used b y ps ychologis ts. Developmental ps ychologis ts use man y
of these appr oaches in or der t o bet ter unders tand ho w individuals chang e mental ly and ph ysical ly over time . These
methods include natur alistic obser vations , case s tudies , sur veys, and e xperiments , among others .
Natur alistic obser vations in volve obser ving beha vior in its natur al context. A de velopmental ps ychologis t might
obser ve ho w childr en beha ve on a pla yground, at a da ycare center, or in the child’ s own home . While this r esear ch
appr oach pr ovides a glimpse int o ho w childr en beha ve in their natur al set tings , resear chers ha ve very little c ontr ol
over the types and/or fr equencies o f displa yed beha vior.
In a case s tudy , developmental ps ychologis ts collect a gr eat deal o f information fr om one individual in or der t o
better unders tand ph ysical and ps ychological chang es o ver the lif espan. This par ticular appr oach is an e xcellent w ay
to bet ter unders tand individuals , who ar e exceptional in some w ay, but it is especial ly prone t o resear cher bias in
interpr etation, and it is difficul t to gener alize conclusions t o the lar ger population.
In one clas sic e xample o f this r esear ch method being applied t o a s tudy o f lifespan de velopment Sigmund F reud
anal yzed the de velopment o f a child kno wn as “Lit tle Hans” (F reud, 1909/1949). F reud’ s findings helped inf orm his
theories o f psychose xual de velopment in childr en, which y ou wil l learn about lat er in this chap ter. Little Genie , the
CONNECT THE CONCEPTS280 9 • Lif espan De velopment
Access for fr ee a t opens tax. org
subject o f a case s tudy discus sed in the chap ter on thinking and int elligence, provides another e xample o f how
psychologis ts examine de velopmental miles tones thr ough detailed r esear ch on a single individual . In Genie ’s case ,
her neglect ful and abusiv e upbringing led t o her being unable t o speak until , at ag e 13, she w as remo ved fr om that
harmful en vironment. As she learned t o use lang uage, psychologis ts w ere able t o compar e ho w her lang uage
acquisition abilities diff ered when oc curring in her lat e-stage de velopment c ompar ed to the typical ac quisition o f
those skil ls during the ag es o f infancy thr ough earl y childhood (F romkin, K rashen, Cur tiss, Rigler , & Rigler , 1974;
Curtiss, 1981).
The sur vey method ask s individuals t o self-r epor t impor tant inf ormation about their thoughts , experienc es, and
beliefs . This par ticular method can pr ovide lar ge amounts o f information in r elativ ely shor t amounts o f time;
however, validity o f data c ollected in this w ay relies on hones t self-r epor ting, and the data is r elativ ely shal low when
compar ed to the dep th of information c ollected in a case s tudy . An e xample o f compr ehensiv e sur vey was the
resear ch done b y Ruth W . Ho ward. In 1934, she ob tained her doct orate by sur veying 229 sets o f triplets , the mos t
compr ehensiv e resear ch o f triplets c omplet ed at the time . This pioneering w oman w as also the firs t African-
American w oman t o earn a PhD in ps ycholog y (American P sychological As sociation, 2019).
Experiments in volve significant c ontr ol over extraneous v ariables and manipulation o f the independent v ariable . As
such, e xperimental r esear ch al lows de velopmental ps ychologis ts to mak e causal s tatements about c ertain v ariables
that ar e impor tant f or the de velopmental pr ocess. Because e xperimental r esear ch mus t occur in a c ontr olled
environment, r esear chers mus t be cautious about whether beha viors obser ved in the labor atory translat e to an
individual ’s natur al en vironment.
Later in this chap ter, you wil l learn about se veral experiments in which t oddlers and y oung childr en obser ve scenes
or actions so that r esear chers can det ermine at what ag e specific c ognitiv e abilities de velop . For example , childr en
may obser ve a quantity o f liquid pour ed fr om a shor t, fat glas s int o a tal l, skinn y glas s. As the e xperiment ers
ques tion the childr en about what oc curr ed, the subjects’ ans wers help ps ychologis ts unders tand at what ag e a child
begins t o compr ehend that the v olume o f liquid r emained the same al though the shapes o f the c ontainers diff ers.
Acros s these three domains —ph ysical, cognitiv e, and ps ychoso cial—the normat ive appro ach to dev elopment
is also discus sed. This appro ach asks , “Wha t is normal dev elopment? ” In the e arly dec ades o f the 20th c entur y,
norma tive ps ychologis ts studie d larg e numb ers o f children a t various a ges to determine norms (i .e., average
ages) o f when mos t children re ach sp ecific dev elopmental miles tones in e ach o f the three domains (Gesell ,
1933, 1939, 1940; Gesell & Ilg , 1946; Hall , 1904). A lthough children dev elop a t slightly diff erent ra tes, we can
use these a ge-rela ted averages as g eneral guidelines to c omp are children with same -age peers to determine
the appro xima te ages the y should re ach sp ecific norma tive ev ents c alleddevelopmental miles tones (e.g.,
crawling , walking , writing , dres sing , naming c olors , speaking in sentenc es, and s tarting pub erty).
Not all norma tive ev ents are univ ersal , me aning the y are not e xperienc ed by all individuals acros s all cultures .
Biologic al miles tones , such as pub erty, tend to b e univ ersal , but so cial miles tones , such as the a ge when
children b egin f ormal scho oling , are not nec essarily univ ersal; ins tead, the y affect mos t individuals in a
particular culture (Gesell & Ilg , 1946). F or e xample , in dev elop ed countries children b egin scho ol around 5 or 6
years old , but in dev eloping c ountries , like Nig eria, children o ften enter scho ol at an adv anced age, if a t all
(Huebler , 2005; Unite d Nations E ducational , Scientific , and Cultural Org aniza tion [UNESC O], 2013).
To better unders tand the norma tive appro ach, ima gine tw o new mothers , Louisa and Kimb erly , who are close
friends and ha ve children around the same a ge. Louisa ’s da ughter is 14 months old , and Kimb erly ’s son is 12
months old . According to the norma tive appro ach, the a verage age a child s tarts to w alk is 12 months .
However, at 14 months Louisa ’s da ughter s till isn ’t walking . She tells Kimb erly she is w orrie d tha t something
might b e wrong with her b aby. Kimb erly is surprise d because her son s tarted walking when he w as only 10
months old . Should Louisa b e worrie d? Should she b e concerne d if her da ughter is not w alking b y 15 months
or 18 months?9.1 • Wha t Is Lif espan De velopment? 281

chapter , rec all tha t dev elopmental ps ycholog y focuses on ho w people chang e, and k eep in mind tha t all the
appro aches tha t we present in this chapter addres s ques tions o f chang e: Is the chang e smo oth or unev en

different p atterns o f chang e (one c ourse o f dev elopment v ersus man y courses)? Ho w do g enetics and
environment interact to influenc e dev elopment (na ture v ersus nur ture)?
Is Development Continuous or Discontinuous?
Continuous de velopment view s dev elopment as a cumula tive pro cess, gradually impro ving on e xisting skills
(Figure 9.2 ). W ith this typ e of dev elopment , there is gradual chang e. Consider , for e xample , a child ’s ph ysical
growth: adding inches to height y ear b y year. In c ontras t, theoris ts who view dev elopment as disc ontinuous
believ e tha t dev elopment tak es plac e in unique s tages: It o ccurs a t specific times or a ges. With this typ e of
development , the chang e is more sudden , such as an infant ’s ability to c onceive object p ermanenc e.
FIGURE 9.2 The c oncept of continuous de velopment can be visualiz ed as a smooth slope o f progression, wher eas
disc ontinuous de velopment sees gr owth in mor e discr ete stages.
Is Ther e One Course of Development or Many?
Is dev elopment es sentially the same , or univ ersal , for all children (i .e., there is one c ourse o f dev elopment) or
does dev elopment f ollow a diff erent c ourse f or e ach child , dep ending on the child ’s sp ecific g enetics and
environment (i .e., there are man y courses o f dev elopment)? Do p eople acros s the w orld share more similarities
or more diff erenc es in their dev elopment? Ho w much do culture and g enetics influenc e a child ’s behavior?
Stage theories hold tha t the se quenc e of dev elopment is univ ersal . For e xample , in cros s-cultural s tudies o f
langua ge dev elopment , children from around the w orld re ach langua ge miles tones in a similar se quenc e
(Gleitman & N ewp ort, 1995). Infants in all cultures c oo before the y babble . The y begin b abbling a t about the
same a ge and ut ter their firs t word around 12 months old . Yet w e liv e in div erse c onte xts tha t ha ve a unique
effect on e ach o f us. For e xample , rese archers onc e believ ed tha t motor dev elopment f ollows one c ourse f or all
children reg ardles s of culture . Ho wever, child c are practic es v ary by culture , and diff erent practic es ha ve been

Are w e who w e are b ecause o fnature (biolog y and g enetics), or are w e who w e are b ecause o fnur ture (our
environment and culture)? This longs tanding ques tion is kno wn in ps ycholog y as the na ture v ersus nur ture
deb ate. It seeks to unders tand ho w our p ersonalities and traits are the pro duct o f our g enetic mak eup and
biologic al factors , and ho w the y are shap ed by our en vironment , including our guardians , peers , and culture .
For ins tanc e, wh y do biologic al children sometimes act lik e their p arents —is it b ecause o f genetics or b ecause
of early childho od en vironment and wha t the child has le arne d from the p arents? Wha t about children who are
adopte d—are the y more lik e their biologic al families or more lik e their adoptiv e families? And ho w can siblings
from the same family b e so diff erent?
We are all b orn with sp ecific g enetic traits inherite d from our p arents , such as e ye color , height , and c ertain
personality traits . Beyond our b asic g enotyp e, however, there is a deep interaction b etween our g enes and our
environment: Our unique e xperienc es in our en vironment influenc e whether and ho w particular traits are
expres sed, and a t the same time , our g enes influenc e ho w w e interact with our en vironment (Diamond , 2009;
Lob o, 2008). This chapter will sho w tha t there is a recipro cal interaction b etween na ture and nur ture as the y
both shap e who w e become , but the deb ate continues as to the rela tive contributions o f each.
The Achiev ement Gap: Ho w Does Socioeconomic Status Aff ect Dev elopment?
The achie vement g ap refers t o the persis tent diff erence in gr ades , test scores, and gr aduation r ates that e xist
among s tudents o f diff erent ethnicities , races, and—in c ertain subjects —genders ( Winerman, 2011). R esear ch

socioec onomic discr epancies w ould lik ely aid in equalizing the ap titude and per formanc e of childr en fr om

it is r ecommended that pr ograms aimed at f ostering ap titude and achie vement among disadv antag ed childr en

There are man y theories reg arding ho w babies and children gro w and dev elop into happ y, health y adults . We
explore sev eral o f these theories in this section .
Psychose xual Theory of Development
Sigmund Freud (1856–1939) b eliev ed tha t personality dev elops during e arly childho od. For F reud , childho od
experienc es shap e our p ersonalities and b ehavior as adults . Freud view ed dev elopment as disc ontinuous; he
believ ed tha t each o f us mus t pass through a series o f stages during childho od, and tha t if w e lack prop er
nurturanc e and p arenting during a s tage, we ma y become s tuck , or fixa ted, in tha t stage. Freud ’s stages are
called the s tages o fpsychose xual de velopment . According to F reud , children ’s ple asure -seeking urg es are
focuse d on a diff erent are a of the b ody, called an erog enous z one, at each o f the fiv e stages o f dev elopment:
oral , anal , phallic , latency , and g enital .
While mos t of Freud ’s ide as ha ve not f ound supp ort in mo dern rese arch , we cannot disc ount the c ontributions
that Freud has made to the field o f psycholog y. Psychologis ts to day dispute F reud's ps ychose xual s tages as a
legitima te explana tion f or ho w one 's personality dev elops , but wha t we can tak e away from F reud ’s theor y is284 9 • Lif espan De velopment
Access for fr ee a t opens tax. org
that personality is shap ed, in some p art, by experienc es w e ha ve in childho od. These s tages are discus sed in
detail in the chapter on p ersonality .
Psychosocial Theory of Development
Erik Erikson (1902–1994) ( Figure 9.4 ), another s tage theoris t, took F reud ’s theor y and mo difie d it as
psychoso cial theor y. Erikson ’spsychoso cial de velopment theor y emphasiz es the so cial na ture o f our
development ra ther than its se xual na ture . While F reud b eliev ed tha t personality is shap ed only in childho od,
Erikson prop osed tha t personality dev elopment tak es plac e all through the lif espan. Erikson sugg ested tha t
how w e interact with others is wha t affects our sense o f self, or wha t he c alled the eg o identity .
FIGURE 9.4 Erik Erik son pr oposed the ps ychosocial theor y of development. In each s tage of Erik son’s theor y, ther e
is a ps ychosocial task that w e mus t mas ter in or der t o feel a sense o f compet ence.
Erikson prop osed tha t we are motiv ated by a nee d to achiev e comp etenc e in c ertain are as o f our liv es.
According to ps ychoso cial theor y, we experienc e eight s tages o f dev elopment o ver our lif espan, from infancy
through la te adultho od. At each s tage there is a c onflict , or task , tha t we nee d to resolv e. Suc cessful c ompletion
of each dev elopmental task results in a sense o f comp etenc e and a he alth y personality . Failure to mas ter these
tasks le ads to f eelings o f inade quacy .
According to Erikson (1963), tr ust is the b asis o f our dev elopment during infancy ( birth to 12 months).
Theref ore, the primar y task o f this s tage is tr ust versus mis trust. Infants are dep endent up on their c aregiv ers,
so c aregiv ers who are resp onsiv e and sensitiv e to their infant ’s nee ds help their b aby to dev elop a sense o f
trust; their b aby will see the w orld as a sa fe, pre dicta ble plac e. Unresp onsiv e caregiv ers who do not meet their
baby’s nee ds c an eng ender f eelings o f anxiety , fear, and mis trust; their b aby ma y see the w orld as
unpre dicta ble.
As to ddlers (a ges 1–3 y ears) b egin to e xplore their w orld , the y learn tha t the y can c ontrol their actions and act
on the en vironment to g et results . The y begin to sho w cle ar pref erenc es for c ertain elements o f the
environment , such as f ood, toys, and clothing . A to ddler ’s main task is to resolv e the is sue o f autonom y versus
shame and doubt , by working to es tablish indep endenc e. This is the “me do it ” stage. For e xample , we might
obser ve a budding sense o f autonom y in a 2- year-old child who w ants to cho ose her clothes and dres s herself.
Although her outfits might not b e appropria te for the situa tion , her input in such b asic decisions has an eff ect
on her sense o f indep endenc e. If denie d the opp ortunity to act on her en vironment , she ma y begin to doubt her
abilities , which c ould le ad to lo w self -esteem and f eelings o f shame .
Onc e children re ach the prescho ol stage (ages 3–6 y ears), the y are c apable o f initia ting activities and as serting
control o ver their w orld through so cial interactions and pla y. According to Erikson , prescho ol children mus t
resolv e the task o f initia tive versus guilt . By learning to plan and achiev e goals while interacting with others ,
prescho ol children c an mas ter this task . Those who do will dev elop self -confidenc e and f eel a sense o f purp ose.
Those who are unsuc cessful a t this s tage—with their initia tive mis firing or s tifle d—ma y dev elop f eelings o f
guilt . Ho w might o ver-controlling p arents s tifle a child ’s initia tive?9.2 • Lif espan Theories 285
During the elementar y scho ol stage (ages 7–11), children fac e the task o f indus try versus inf eriority . Children
begin to c omp are themselv es to their p eers to see ho w the y me asure up . The y either dev elop a sense o f pride
and ac complishment in their scho olwork, sports, social activities , and family lif e, or the y feel inf erior and
inade qua te when the y don ’t me asure up . Wha t are some things p arents and te achers c an do to help children
develop a sense o f comp etenc e and a b elief in themselv es and their a bilities?
In adolesc ence (ages 12–18), children fac e the task o f identity v ersus role c onfusion . According to Erikson , an
adolesc ent’s main task is dev eloping a sense o f self. A dolesc ents s truggle with ques tions such as “ Who am I? ”
and “ Wha t do I w ant to do with m y life?” Along the w ay, mos t adolesc ents tr y on man y diff erent selv es to see
which ones fit . Adolesc ents who are suc cessful a t this s tage ha ve a s trong sense o f identity and are a ble to
remain tr ue to their b eliefs and v alues in the fac e of problems and other p eople ’s persp ectiv es. Wha t happ ens
to ap athetic adolesc ents , who do not mak e a c onscious se arch f or identity , or those who are pres sure d to
conform to their p arents’ ide as for the future? These teens will ha ve a w eak sense o f self and e xperienc e role
confusion . The y are unsure o f their identity and c onfuse d about the future .
People in e arly adultho od (i.e., 20s through e arly 40s) are c oncerne d with intimacy v ersus isola tion . After w e
have dev elop ed a sense o f self in adolesc ence, we are re ady to share our lif e with others . Erikson said tha t we
mus t ha ve a s trong sense o f self b efore dev eloping intima te rela tionships with others . Adults who do not
develop a p ositiv e self -concept in adolesc ence ma y experienc e feelings o f lonelines s and emotional isola tion .
When p eople re ach their 40s , the y enter the time kno wn as middle adultho od, which e xtends to the mid-60s .
The so cial task o f middle adultho od is g enera tivity v ersus s tagnation . Genera tivity in volves finding y our lif e’s
work and c ontributing to the dev elopment o f others , through activities such as v olunteering , mentoring , and
raising children . Those who do not mas ter this task ma y experienc e stagnation , having lit tle c onnection with
others and lit tle interes t in pro ductivity and self -impro vement .
From the mid-60s to the end o f life, we are in the p erio d of dev elopment kno wn as la te adultho od. Erikson ’s
task a t this s tage is c alled integrity v ersus desp air. He said tha t people in la te adultho od reflect on their liv es
and f eel either a sense o f satisfaction or a sense o f failure . People who f eel proud o f their ac complishments f eel
a sense o f integrity , and the y can lo ok b ack on their liv es with f ew regrets . Ho wever, people who are not
successful a t this s tage ma y feel as if their lif e has b een w asted. The y focus on wha t “would ha ve,” “should
have,” and “ could ha ve” been. The y fac e the end o f their liv es with f eelings o f bit ternes s, depres sion , and

Cognitive Theory of Development
JeanPiaget(1896–1980) is another s tage theoris t who s tudie d childho od dev elopment ( Figure 9.5 ). Ins tead o f
appro aching dev elopment from a ps ychoanalytic al or ps ychoso cial p ersp ectiv e, Pia get focuse d on children ’s
cognitiv e gro wth . He b eliev ed tha t thinking is a c entral asp ect o f dev elopment and tha t children are na turally
inquisitiv e. Ho wever, he said tha t children do not think and re ason lik e adults (Pia get, 1930, 1932). His theor y
of cognitiv e dev elopment holds tha t our c ognitiv e abilities dev elop through sp ecific s tages, which e xemplifies
the disc ontinuity appro ach to dev elopment . As w e progres s to a new s tage, there is a dis tinct shift in ho w w e
think and re ason .
FIGURE 9.5 Jean Piag et spent o ver 50 y ears s tudying childr en and ho w their minds de velop .
Piaget said tha t children dev elop schema ta to help them unders tand the w orld .Schemata are c oncepts
(mental mo dels) tha t are use d to help us c ategoriz e and interpret inf orma tion . By the time children ha ve
reache d adultho od, the y ha ve cre ated schema ta for almos t everything . When children le arn new inf orma tion ,
they adjus t their schema ta through tw o pro cesses: as simila tion and ac commo dation . First, the y as simila te new
informa tion or e xperienc es in terms o f their current schema ta:assimilat ion is when the y tak e in inf orma tion
that is c omp arable to wha t the y alre ady kno w.Accommo dation describ es when the y chang e their schema ta
based on new inf orma tion . This pro cess continues as children interact with their en vironment .
For e xample , 2-year-old Ab dul le arne d the schema f or dogs b ecause his family has a La brador retriev er. When
Abdul sees other dogs in his picture b ooks, he sa ys, “Lo ok momm y, dog!” Thus , he has as simila ted them into9.2 • Lif espan Theories 287
his schema f or dogs . One da y, Ab dul sees a sheep f or the firs t time and sa ys, “Lo ok momm y, dog!” Ha ving a
basic schema tha t a dog is an animal with f our legs and fur , Ab dul thinks all furr y, four-legg ed cre atures are
dogs . When Ab dul’s mom tells him tha t the animal he sees is a sheep , not a dog , Ab dul mus t accommo date his
schema f or dogs to include more inf orma tion b ased on his new e xperienc es. Ab dul’s schema f or dog w as to o
broad, sinc e not all furr y, four-legg ed cre atures are dogs . He no w mo difies his schema f or dogs and f orms a
new one f or sheep .
Like Freud and Erikson , Pia get thought dev elopment unf olds in a series o f stages appro xima tely as sociated
with a ge rang es. He prop osed a theor y of cognitiv e dev elopment tha t unf olds in f our s tages: sensorimotor ,
preop erational , concrete op erational , and f ormal op erational ( Table 9.2 ).

The firs t stage is the sensorimotor stage, which las ts from bir th to a bout 2 y ears old . During this s tage,
children le arn a bout the w orld through their senses and motor b ehavior . Young children put objects in their
mouths to see if the items are e dible , and onc e the y can grasp objects , the y ma y shak e or b ang them to see if
they mak e sounds . Betw een 5 and 8 months old , the child dev elops object p ermanenc e, which is the
unders tanding tha t even if something is out o f sight , it s till e xists (Bog artz, Shinsk ey, & Schilling , 2000).
According to Pia get, young infants do not rememb er an object a fter it has b een remo ved from sight . Pia get
studie d infants’ re actions when a to y was firs t sho wn to an infant and then hidden under a blank et. Infants
who had alre ady dev elop ed object p ermanenc e would re ach f or the hidden to y, indic ating tha t the y knew it s till
existed, where as infants who had not dev elop ed object p ermanenc e would app ear confuse d.

In Pia get’s view , around the same time children dev elop object p ermanenc e, the y also b egin to e xhibit s trang er
anxiety , which is a f ear o f unfamiliar p eople . Babies ma y demons trate this b y cr ying and turning a way from a
strang er, by clinging to a c aregiv er, or b y attempting to re ach their arms to ward familiar fac es such as p arents .

she c an’t pre dict wha t her e xperienc e with tha t strang er will b e lik e, which results in a f ear resp onse .
Piaget’s sec ond s tage is the preop erat ional s tage, which is from appro xima tely 2 to 7 y ears old . In this s tage,
children c an use s ymb ols to represent w ords , ima ges, and ide as, which is wh y children in this s tage eng age in
pretend pla y. A child ’s arms might b ecome airplane wings as the y zoom around the ro om, or a child with a
stick might b ecome a bra ve knight with a s word. Children also b egin to use langua ge in the preop erational
stage, but the y cannot unders tand adult logic or mentally manipula te inf orma tion (the term operational refers
to logic al manipula tion o f inf orma tion , so children a t this s tage are c onsidere d to b epre-operational).
Children ’s logic is b ased on their o wn p ersonal kno wledge of the w orld so far , rather than on c onventional
kno wledge. For e xample , dad g ave a slic e of pizza to 10- year-old K eiko and another slic e to her 3- year-old
brother , Kenn y. Kenn y’s pizza slic e was cut into fiv e piec es, so K enn y told his sis ter tha t he g ot more pizza than
she did . Children in this s tage cannot p erform mental op erations b ecause the y ha ve not dev elop ed an
unders tanding o fconser vation, which is the ide a tha t even if y ou chang e the app earanc e of something , it is
still e qual in siz e as long as nothing has b een remo ved or adde d.

During this s tage, we also e xpect children to displa yegocentrism , which me ans tha t the child is not a ble to
take the p ersp ectiv e of others . A child a t this s tage thinks tha t everyone sees , thinks , and f eels jus t as the y do .
Let’s look a t Kenn y and K eiko again. Keiko’s bir thda y is c oming up , so their mom tak es K enn y to the to y store to
choose a present f or his sis ter. He selects an Iron Man action figure f or her , thinking tha t if he lik es the to y, his
sister will to o. An eg ocentric child is not a ble to inf er the p ersp ectiv e of other p eople and ins tead a ttributes his
own p ersp ectiv e.

Piaget dev elop ed the Three -Mountain T ask to determine the lev el of egocentrism displa yed by children .
Children view a 3- dimensional mountain sc ene from one viewp oint , and are ask ed wha t another p erson a t a
different viewp oint w ould see in the same sc ene. Watch this shor t video o f the Three Mountain T ask in action
(http://openstax.org/l/W onder Years) from the Univ ersity o f Minnesota and the Scienc e Museum o f Minnesota.
Piaget’s third s tage is the concrete op erat ional s tage, which o ccurs from a bout 7 to 11 y ears old . In this s tage,
children c an think logic ally a bout re al (c oncrete) ev ents; the y ha ve a firm grasp on the use o f numb ers and
start to emplo y memor y strategies . The y can p erform ma thema tical op erations and unders tand
trans forma tions , such as addition is the opp osite o f subtraction , and multiplic ation is the opp osite o f division .
In this s tage, children also mas ter the c oncept o f conser vation: E ven if something chang es shap e, its mas s,
volume , and numb er stay the same . For e xample , if y ou p our w ater from a tall , thin glas s to a shor t, fat glas s,
you s till ha ve the same amount o f water. Rememb er K eiko and K enn y and the pizza? Ho w did K eiko kno w tha t
Kenn y was wrong when he said tha t he had more pizza?
Children in the c oncrete op erational s tage also unders tand the principle o freversibilit y, which me ans tha t
objects c an b e chang ed and then returne d back to their original f orm or c ondition . Take, for e xample , water
that you p oure d into the shor t, fat glas s: You c an p our w ater from the fa t glas s back to the thin glas s and s till
have the same amount (minus a c ouple o f drops).
The f ourth, and las t, stage in Pia get’s theor y is the formal op erat ional s tage, which is from a bout a ge 11 to
adultho od. Where as children in the c oncrete op erational s tage are a ble to think logic ally only a bout c oncrete
events , children in the f ormal op erational s tage can also de al with a bstract ide as and h ypothetic al situa tions .
Children in this s tage can use a bstract thinking to problem solv e, look a t alterna tive solutions , and tes t these

solutions . In adolesc ence, a renew ed eg ocentrism o ccurs . For e xample , a 15- year-old with a v ery small pimple
on her fac e might think it is hug e and incre dibly visible , under the mis taken impres sion tha t others mus t share
her p erceptions .
Beyond F ormal Oper ational Thought
As with other major c ontributors o f theories o f dev elopment , sev eral o f Pia get’s ide as ha ve come under
criticism b ased on the results o f fur ther rese arch . For e xample , sev eral c ontemp orar y studies supp ort a mo del
of dev elopment tha t is more c ontinuous than Pia get’s discrete s tages (C oura ge & Ho we, 2002; Siegler , 2005,
2006). Man y others sugg est tha t children re ach c ognitiv e miles tones e arlier than Pia get describ es (Baillarg eon ,
2004; de Hevia & S pelke, 2010).
According to Pia get, the highes t lev el of cognitiv e dev elopment is f ormal op erational thought , which dev elops
between 11 and 20 y ears old . Ho wever, man y dev elopmental ps ychologis ts disa gree with Pia get, sugg esting a
fifth s tage of cognitiv e dev elopment , kno wn as the p ostformal s tage (Bas seches , 1984; C ommons & Breset te,
2006; Sinnot t, 1998). In p ostformal thinking , decisions are made b ased on situa tions and circums tanc es, and
logic is integra ted with emotion as adults dev elop principles tha t dep end on c onte xts. One w ay tha t we can see
the diff erenc e between an adult in p ostformal thought and an adolesc ent in f ormal op erations is in terms o f
how the y handle emotionally charg ed issues .
It seems tha t onc e we re ach adultho od our problem solving a bilities chang e: As w e attempt to solv e problems ,
we tend to think more deeply a bout man y are as o f our liv es, such as rela tionships , work, and p olitics
(Labouvie -Vief & Diehl , 1999). Bec ause o f this , postformal think ers are a ble to dra w on p ast experienc es to help
them solv e new problems . Problem-solving s trategies using p ostformal thought v ary, dep ending on the

Neur oconstructivism
The g enetic en vironmental c orrelation y ou’ve learned about c oncerning the bidir ectional influenc e of genes and the
environment has been e xplor ed in mor e recent theories (Ne wcombe , 2011). One such theor y, neur oconstructivism,
suggests that neur al br ain de velopment influenc es cognitiv e de velopment. Experienc es that a child enc ount ers can
impact or chang e the w ay that neur al path ways de velop in r esponse t o the en vironment. An individual ’s beha vior is
based on ho w one unders tands the w orld. Ther e is int eraction betw een neur al and c ognitiv e netw orks at and
betw een each le vel, consis ting o f these:
•genes
•neur ons
•brain
•body
•social en vironment
These int eractions shape mental r epresentations in the br ain and ar e dependent on c ontext that individuals activ ely
explor e thr oughout their lif etimes ( Westermann, Mar eschal , Johnson, Sir ois, Spr atling , & Thomas , 2007).
An e xample o f this w ould be a child who ma y be g enetical ly predisposed t o a difficul t temper ament. The y ma y ha ve
parents who pr ovide a social en vironment in which the y are enc ouraged to express themsel ves in an op timal
manner . The child's br ain w ould f orm neur al connections enhanc ed b y that en vironment, thus influencing the br ain.
The br ain giv es inf ormation t o the body about ho w it wil l experienc e the en vironment. Thus , neur al and c ognitiv e
netw orks work t ogether t o influenc e genes (i. e., attenuating t emper ament), body (i. e., ma y be les s prone t o high
blood pr essure), and social en vironment (i. e., ma y seek people who ar e similar t o them).

SOCIOCUL TURAL THEOR Y OF DEVEL OPMENT
Lev V ygotsky w as a R ussian ps ychologis t who prop osed a so ciocultural theor y of dev elopment . He sugg ested
that human dev elopment is ro oted in one ’s culture . A child ’s so cial w orld , for e xample , forms the b asis f or the
forma tion o f langua ge and thought . The langua ge one sp eaks and the w ays a p erson thinks a bout things is
dep endent on one ’s cultural b ackground . Vygotsky also c onsidere d his toric al influenc es as k ey to one ’s
development . He w as interes ted in the pro cess of dev elopment and the individual ’s interactions with their
environment (J ohn-Steiner & Mahn , 1996).
Mor al Theory Of Development
A major task b eginning in childho od and c ontinuing into adolesc ence is disc erning right from wrong .
Psychologis t Lawrenc eKohlb erg (1927–1987) e xtende d up on the f ounda tion tha t Pia get built reg arding
cognitiv e dev elopment . Kohlb erg b eliev ed tha t moral dev elopment , like cognitiv e dev elopment , follows a
series o f stages. To dev elop this theor y, Kohlb erg p osed moral dilemmas to p eople o f all a ges, and then he
analyz ed their ans wers to find evidenc e of their p articular s tage of moral dev elopment . Bef ore re ading a bout
the s tages, tak e a minute to c onsider ho w you w ould ans wer one o f Kohlb erg's best-kno wn moral dilemmas ,
commonly kno wn as the Heinz dilemma:
In Europ e, a w oman w as ne ar de ath from a sp ecial kind o f cancer. There w as one dr ug tha t the do ctors
thought might sa ve her . It w as a f orm o f radium tha t a dr uggis t in the same to wn had rec ently
disc overed. The dr ug w as e xpensiv e to mak e, but the dr uggis t was charging ten times wha t the dr ug
cost him to mak e. He p aid $200 f or the radium and charg ed $2,000 f or a small dose o f the dr ug. The
sick w oman 's husb and , Heinz, w ent to ev eryone he knew to b orro w the mone y, but he c ould only g et
together a bout $1,000, which is half o f wha t it c ost. He told the dr uggis t tha t his wif e was dying and
asked him to sell it che aper or let him p ay later. But the dr uggis t said: “N o, I disc overed the dr ug and
I'm g oing to mak e mone y from it .” So Heinz g ot desp erate and brok e into the man 's store to s teal the
drug for his wif e. Should the husb and ha ve done tha t? (K ohlb erg, 1969, p . 379)
How w ould y ou ans wer this dilemma? K ohlb erg w as not interes ted in whether y ou ans wer yes or no to the
dilemma: Ins tead, he w as interes ted in the re asoning b ehind y our ans wer.
After presenting p eople with this and v arious other moral dilemmas , Kohlb erg review ed people ’s resp onses
and plac ed them in diff erent stages of moral re asoning (Figure 9.6 ). According to K ohlb erg, an individual
progres ses from the c apacity f or pre -conventional morality ( before a ge 9) to the c apacity f or c onventional
morality (e arly adolesc ence), and to ward a ttaining p ost-conventional morality (onc e formal op erational
thought is a ttaine d), which only a f ew fully achiev e. Kohlb erg plac ed in the highes t stage resp onses tha t
reflecte d the re asoning tha t Heinz should s teal the dr ug b ecause his wif e’s life is more imp ortant than the
pharmacis t making mone y. The v alue o f a human lif e overrides the pharmacis t’s gree d.9.2 • Lif espan Theories 291
FIGURE 9.6 Kohlber g identified thr ee le vels o f mor al reasoning: pr e-conventional , conventional , and pos t-
conventional: Each le vel is as sociat ed with incr easingl y comple x stages o f mor al de velopment.
It is imp ortant to re alize tha t even those p eople who ha ve the mos t sophis ticated, post-conventional re asons
for some choic es ma y mak e other choic es for the simples t of pre -conventional re asons . Man y ps ychologis ts
agree with K ohlb erg's theor y of moral dev elopment but p oint out tha t moral re asoning is v ery diff erent from
moral b ehavior . Sometimes wha t we sa y we would do in a situa tion is not wha t we actually do in tha t situa tion .
In other w ords , we might “ talk the talk ,” but not “ walk the w alk.”
How do es this theor y apply to p eople o f diff erent g enders? K ohlb erg (1969) f elt tha t more men than w omen
move past stage four in their moral dev elopment . He w ent on to note tha t women seem to b e deficient in their
moral re asoning a bilities . These ide as w ere not w ell rec eived by Carol Gillig an, a rese arch as sistant o f
Kohlb erg, who c onse quently dev elop ed her o wn ide as o f moral dev elopment . In her groundbre aking b ook,In a
Different V oice: Psychologic al Theor y and W omen ’s Dev elopment , Gillig an (1982) criticiz ed her f ormer
mentor ’s theor y because it w as b ased only on upp er clas s White men and b oys. She argue d tha t women are not
deficient in their moral re asoning—she prop osed tha t diff erent g enders re ason diff erently . Girls and w omen
focus more on s taying c onnecte d and the imp ortanc e of interp ersonal rela tionships . Theref ore, in the Heinz
dilemma, man y girls and w omen resp ond tha t Heinz should not s teal the me dicine . Their re asoning is tha t if
he s teals the me dicine , is arres ted, and is put in jail , then he and his wif e will b e sep arated, and she c ould die
while he is s till in prison .

infant , child , adolesc ent, and adult dev elopment .
Prenatal Development
How did y ou c ome to b e who y ou are? F rom b eginning as a one -cell s tructure to y our bir th, your prena tal
development occurre d in an orderly and delic ate se quenc e.
There are three s tages o f prena tal dev elopment: g erminal , embr yonic , and f etal . Let ’s tak e a lo ok a t wha t
happ ens to the dev eloping b aby in e ach o f these s tages.
Germinal Stage (W eek s 1–2)
In the discus sion o f biops ycholog y earlier in the b ook, you le arne d about g enetics and DN A. DN A is p assed on
to the child a t the moment o f conception .Conc eption occurs when sp erm f ertiliz es an egg and f orms a zy gote
(Figure 9.7 ). A zygote begins as a one -cell s tructure tha t is cre ated when a sp erm and egg merg e. The g enetic
mak eup and se x of the zy gote are set a t this p oint . During the firs t week a fter c onception , the zy gote divides
and multiplies , going from a one -cell s tructure to tw o cells, then f our c ells, then eight c ells, and so on . This
process of cell division is c alledmitosis . Mitosis is a fra gile pro cess, and f ewer than one -half o f all zy gotes
survive beyond the firs t two weeks (Hall , 2004). After 5 da ys of mitosis there are 100 c ells, and a fter 9 months
there are billions o f cells. As the c ells divide , the y become more sp ecializ ed, forming diff erent org ans and b ody
parts. In the g erminal s tage, the mas s of cells has y et to a ttach itself to the lining o f the mother ’s uter us. Onc e it
does, the ne xt stage begins .
FIGURE 9.7 Sperm and o vum fuse at the point o f conception.
Embryonic Stage (W eek s 3–8)
After the zy gote divides f or a bout 7–10 da ys and has 150 c ells, it tra vels do wn the fallopian tub es and implants
itself in the lining o f the uter us. Up on implanta tion , this multi-c ellular org anism is c alled an embr yo. Now
blood vessels gro w, forming the plac enta. The plac enta is a s tructure c onnecte d to the uter us tha t pro vides
nourishment and o xygen from the mother to the dev eloping embr yo via the umbilic al cord. Basic s tructures o f
the embr yo start to dev elop into are as tha t will b ecome the he ad, ches t, and a bdomen . During the embr yonic
stage, the he art begins to b eat and org ans f orm and b egin to function . The neural tub e forms along the b ack o f
the embr yo, dev eloping into the spinal c ord and brain .
Fetal Stage (W eek s 9–40)
When the org anism is a bout nine w eeks old , the embr yo is c alled a f etus . At this s tage, the f etus is a bout the
size of a kidne y bean and b egins to tak e on the rec ogniza ble f orm o f a human b eing as the “ tail” begins to
disapp ear.
From 9–12 w eeks , the se x org ans b egin to diff erentia te. At about 16 w eeks , the f etus is appro xima tely 4.5
inches long . Fingers and to es are fully dev elop ed, and fing erprints are visible . By the time the f etus re aches the
sixth month o f dev elopment (24 w eeks), it w eighs up to 1.4 p ounds . He aring has dev elop ed, so the f etus c an
resp ond to sounds . The internal org ans, such as the lungs , heart, stomach , and intes tines , have forme d enough
that a fetus b orn prema turely a t this p oint has a chanc e to sur vive outside o f the mother ’s womb . Throughout
the f etal s tage the brain c ontinues to gro w and dev elop , nearly doubling in siz e from w eeks 16 to 28. Around 369.3 • S tages o f De velopment 293
weeks , the f etus is almos t ready f or bir th. It w eighs a bout 6 p ounds and is a bout 18.5 inches long , and b y week
37 all o f the f etus’ s org an s ystems are dev elop ed enough tha t it c ould sur vive outside the uter us without man y
of the risks as sociated with prema ture bir th. The f etus c ontinues to g ain w eight and gro w in length until
appro xima tely 40 w eeks . By then , the f etus has v ery little ro om to mo ve around and bir th b ecomes imminent .
The progres sion through the s tages is sho wn in Figure 9.8 .

Should P eople Who Use Drugs During Pr egnancy Be Arr ested and Jailed?

Wha t can y oung infants see , hear, and smell? N ewb orn infants’ sensor y abilities are signific ant, but their

caregiv ers and other humans . Although vision is their le ast dev elop ed sense , newb orns alre ady sho w a

When the infants he ard their mother ’s voice, the y suck ed more s trongly a t the p acifier (Mills & Melhuish ,

In infancy , toddlerho od, and e arly childho od, the b ody’s ph ysical dev elopment is rapid ( Figure 9.10 ). On
average, newb orns w eigh b etween 5 and 10 p ounds , and a newb orn’s weight typic ally doubles in six months
and triples in one y ear. By 2 y ears old the w eight will ha ve quadr uple d, so w e can e xpect tha t a 2 y ear old

majority o f neural c onnections and p athways occur during the firs t few y ears o f a child ’s life (N ational Ins titute
of Neurologic al Disorders and Strok e, 2019). This p erio d of rapid neural gro wth is c alled blo oming . Neural
pathways continue to dev elop through pub erty. The blo oming p erio d of neural gro wth is then f ollowed by a
perio d of pruning , where neural c onnections are re duced. It is thought tha t pruning c auses the brain to
function more efficiently , allo wing f or mas tery of more c omple x skills (Hutchinson , 2011). Blo oming o ccurs

The siz e of our brains incre ases rapidly . For e xample , the brain o f a 2- year-old is 55% o f its adult siz e, and b y 6

lobes gro w rapidly . Recalling our discus sion o f the 4 lob es o f the brain e arlier in this b ook, the frontal lob es are
associated with planning , reasoning , memor y, and impulse c ontrol . Theref ore, by the time children re ach
scho ol age, the y are dev elopmentally c apable o f controlling their a ttention and b ehavior . Through the
elementar y scho ol years, the frontal , temp oral , occipital , and p arietal lob es all gro w in siz e. The brain gro wth

Motor dev elopment o ccurs in an orderly se quenc e as infants mo ve from refle xive re actions (e .g., sucking and
rooting ) to more adv anced motor functioning . For ins tanc e, babies firs t learn to hold their he ads up , then to sit
with as sistanc e, and then to sit unas sisted, followed later b y cra wling and then w alking .
Motor skills refer to our a bility to mo ve our b odies and manipula te objects .Fine motor skills focus on the
muscles in our fing ers, toes, and e yes, and ena ble c oordina tion o f small actions (e .g., grasping a to y, writing
with a p encil , and using a sp oon). Gros s motor skills focus on larg e muscle groups tha t control our arms and
legs and in volve larg er mo vements (e .g., balancing , running , and jumping ).
As motor skills dev elop , there are c ertain dev elopmental miles tones tha t young children should achiev e (Table
9.4). For e ach miles tone there is an a verage age, as w ell as a rang e of ages in which the miles tone should b e

90% o f babies achiev e this b etween 3 w eeks and 4 months old . If a b aby is not holding up their he ad b y 4

Cognitive Development
In addition to rapid ph ysical gro wth , young children also e xhibit signific ant dev elopment o f their c ognitiv e
abilities . Pia get thought tha t children ’s ability to unders tand objects —such as le arning tha t a ra ttle mak es a
noise when shak en—w as a c ognitiv e skill tha t dev elops slo wly as a child ma tures and interacts with the
environment . Today, dev elopmental ps ychologis ts think Pia get w as inc orrect . Researchers ha ve found tha t
even v ery young children unders tand objects and ho w the y work long b efore the y ha ve experienc e with those
objects (Baillarg eon , 1987; Baillarg eon , Li, Ger tner , & W u, 2011). F or e xample , children as y oung as 3 months
old demons trated kno wledge of the prop erties o f objects tha t the y had only view ed and did not ha ve prior
experienc e with them . In one s tudy , 3-month-old infants w ere sho wn a tr uck rolling do wn a track and b ehind a
screen . The b ox, which app eared solid but w as actually hollo w, was plac ed ne xt to the track . The tr uck rolle d
past the b ox as w ould b e expecte d. Then the b ox was plac ed on the track to blo ck the p ath o f the tr uck. When
the tr uck w as rolle d do wn the track this time , it c ontinue d unimp eded. The infants sp ent signific antly more
time lo oking a t this imp ossible ev ent ( Figure 9.11 ). Baillarg eon (1987) c onclude d tha t the y knew solid objects
cannot p ass through e ach other . Baillarg eon’s findings sugg est tha t very young children ha ve an unders tanding
of objects and ho w the y work, which Pia get (1954) w ould ha ve said is b eyond their c ognitiv e abilities due to
their limite d experienc es in the w orld .

Just as there are ph ysical miles tones tha t we expect children to re ach, there are also c ognitiv e miles tones . It is
helpful to b e aware o f these miles tones as children g ain new a bilities to think , problem solv e, and
communic ate. For e xample , infants shak e their he ad “no ” around 6–9 months , and the y resp ond to v erbal
reques ts to do things lik e “wave bye-bye” or “blo w a kis s” around 9–12 months . Rememb er Pia get’s ide as
about object p ermanenc e? W e can e xpect children to grasp the c oncept tha t objects c ontinue to e xist even
when the y are not in sight b y around 8 months old . Bec ause to ddlers (i .e., 12–24 months old) ha ve mas tere d9.3 • S tages o f De velopment 299
object p ermanenc e, the y enjo y games lik e hide and seek , and the y re alize tha t when someone le aves the ro om
they will c ome b ack (Lo op, 2013). T oddlers also p oint to pictures in b ooks and lo ok in appropria te plac es when
you ask them to find objects .
Prescho ol-a ge children (i .e., 3–5 y ears old) also mak e steady progres s in c ognitiv e dev elopment . Not only c an
they count , name c olors , and tell y ou their name and a ge, but the y can also mak e some decisions on their o wn,
such as cho osing an outfit to w ear. Prescho ol-a ge children unders tand b asic time c oncepts and se quencing
(e.g., before and a fter), and the y can pre dict wha t will happ en ne xt in a s tory. The y also b egin to enjo y the use
of humor in s tories . Bec ause the y can think s ymb olically, the y enjo y pretend pla y and in venting ela borate
characters and sc enarios . One o f the mos t common e xamples o f their c ognitiv e gro wth is their blos soming
curiosity . Prescho ol-a ge children lo ve to ask “ Why?”
An imp ortant c ognitiv e chang e occurs in children this a ge. Recall tha t Pia get describ ed 2–3 y ear olds as
egocentric , me aning tha t the y do not ha ve an a warenes s of others’ p oints o f view . Betw een 3 and 5 y ears old ,
children c ome to unders tand tha t people ha ve thoughts , feelings , and b eliefs tha t are diff erent from their o wn.
This is kno wn as theor y-of-mind ( TOM). Children c an use this skill to te ase others , persuade their p arents to
purchase a c andy b ar, or unders tand wh y a sibling might b e angr y. When children dev elop T OM, the y can
recogniz e tha t others ha ve false b eliefs (Dennet t, 1987; C allaghan et al ., 2005).

Cognitiv e skills c ontinue to e xpand in middle and la te childho od (6–11 y ears old). Thought pro cesses b ecome
more logic al and org aniz ed when de aling with c oncrete inf orma tion ( Figure 9.12 ). Children a t this a ge
unders tand c oncepts such as the p ast, present , and future , giving them the a bility to plan and w ork to ward
goals. Additionally , the y can pro cess comple x ide as such as addition and subtraction and c ause-and-eff ect
rela tionships . Ho wever, children ’s attention sp ans tend to b e very limite d until the y are around 11 y ears old .
After tha t point , it b egins to impro ve through adultho od.

One w ell-rese arche d asp ect o f cognitiv e dev elopment is langua ge ac quisition . As mentione d earlier , the order
in which children le arn langua ge structures is c onsis tent acros s children and cultures (Ha tch, 1983). Y ou’ve

gesture usa ge pre dicts subse quent langua ge dev elopment (Iv erson & Goldin-Me adow, 2005). In terms o f
producing sp oken langua ge, babies b egin to c oo almos t imme diately. Cooing is a one -syllable c ombina tion o f a
consonant and a v owel sound (e .g., coo or b a). Interes tingly , babies replic ate sounds from their o wn langua ges.
A baby whose p arents sp eak F rench will c oo in a diff erent tone than a b aby whose p arents sp eak S panish or
Urdu . After c ooing , the b aby starts to b abble . Babbling b egins with rep eating a s yllable, such as ma-ma, da-da,
or b a-ba. When b abies are a bout 12 months old , we expect them to sa y their firs t word f or me aning , and to
start combining w ords f or me aning a t about 18 months .
At about 2 y ears old , a to ddler uses b etween 50 and 200 w ords; b y 3 y ears old the y ha ve a v ocabular y of up to
1,000 w ords and c an sp eak in sentenc es. During the e arly childho od years, children 's vocabular y incre ases a t a
rapid p ace. This is sometimes ref erre d to as the “ vocabular y spur t” and has b een claime d to in volve an
expansion in v ocabular y at a ra te of 10–20 new w ords p er w eek. Recent rese arch ma y indic ate tha t while some
children e xperienc e these spur ts, it is far from univ ersal (as discus sed in G anger & Brent , 2004). It has b een
estima ted tha t, 5 y ear olds unders tand a bout 6,000 w ords , speak 2,000 w ords , and c an define w ords and
ques tion their me anings . The y can rh yme and name the da ys of the w eek. Sev en y ear olds sp eak fluently and
use slang and clichés (Stork & W iddo wson, 1974).
Wha t accounts f or such drama tic langua ge learning b y children? Beha vioris t B. F. Skinner thought tha t we
learn langua ge in resp onse to reinf orcement or f eedback, such as through p arental appro val or through b eing
unders tood. For e xample , when a tw o-year-old child asks f or juic e, he might sa y, “me juic e,” to which his
mother might resp ond b y giving him a cup o f apple juic e. Noam Chomsky (1957) criticiz ed Skinner ’s theor y
and prop osed tha t we are all b orn with an inna te capacity to le arn langua ge. Chomsky c alled this mechanism a
langua ge ac quisition devic e (LAD). Who is c orrect? Both Chomsky and Skinner are right . Rememb er tha t we
are a pro duct o f both na ture and nur ture . Researchers no w believ e tha t langua ge ac quisition is p artially inb orn
and p artially le arne d through our interactions with our linguis tic en vironment (Gleitman & N ewp ort, 1995;
Stork & W iddo wson, 1974).
Attachment
Psychoso cial dev elopment o ccurs as children f orm rela tionships , interact with others , and unders tand and
mana ge their f eelings . In so cial and emotional dev elopment , forming he alth y attachments is v ery imp ortant
and is the major so cial miles tone o f infancy .Attachment is a long-s tanding c onnection or b ond with others .
Dev elopmental ps ychologis ts are interes ted in ho w infants re ach this miles tone . The y ask such ques tions as:
How do p arent and infant a ttachment b onds f orm? Ho w do es neglect a ffect these b onds? Wha t accounts f or
children ’s attachment diff erenc es?
Researchers Harr y Harlo w, John Bo wlby, and Mar y Ains worth conducte d studies designe d to ans wer these
ques tions . In the 1950s , Harlo w conducte d a series o f experiments on monk eys. He sep arated newb orn
monk eys from their mothers . Each monk ey was presente d with tw o surrog ate mothers . One surrog ate monk ey
was made out o f wire mesh , and she c ould disp ense milk . The other monk ey was so fter and made from cloth:
This monk ey did not disp ense milk . Research sho ws tha t the monk eys pref erre d the so ft, cuddly cloth monk ey,
even though she did not pro vide an y nourishment . The b aby monk eys sp ent their time clinging to the cloth
monk ey and only w ent to the wire monk ey when the y nee ded to b e fed. Prior to this s tudy , the me dical and
scientific c ommunities g enerally thought tha t babies b ecome a ttache d to the p eople who pro vide their
nourishment . Ho wever, Harlo w (1958) c onclude d tha t there w as more to the mother -child b ond than
nourishment . Feelings o f comf ort and security are the critic al comp onents to ma ternal-infant b onding , which

Building on the w ork o f Harlo w and others , John Bo wlby dev elop ed the c oncept o f attachment theor y. He
define d attachment as the a ffectional b ond or tie tha t an infant f orms with the mother (Bo wlby, 1969). An
infant mus t form this b ond with a primar y caregiv er in order to ha ve normal so cial and emotional
development . In addition , Bowlby prop osed tha t this a ttachment b ond is v ery powerful and c ontinues
throughout lif e. He use d the c oncept o f secure b ase to define a he alth y attachment b etween p arent and child
(1988). A secure b ase is a p arental presenc e tha t giv es the child a sense o f safety as he e xplores his
surroundings . Bowlby said tha t two things are nee ded for a he alth y attachment: The c aregiv er mus t be
resp onsiv e to the child ’s ph ysical, social, and emotional nee ds; and the c aregiv er and child mus t eng age in
mutually enjo yable interactions (Bo wlby, 1969) ( Figure 9.13 ).
FIGURE 9.13 Mutual ly enjo yable int eractions pr omot e the par ent-infant bond. (cr edit:

While Bo wlby thought a ttachment w as an all-or -nothing pro cess, Mar y Ains worth’s (1970) rese arch sho wed
other wise . Ains worth w ante d to kno w if children diff er in the w ays the y bond , and if so , wh y. To find the
answers, she use d the Strang e Situa tion pro cedure to s tudy a ttachment b etween mothers and their infants
(1970). In the Strang e Situa tion , the mother (or primar y caregiv er) and the infant (a ge 12-18 months) are
plac ed in a ro om tog ether . There are to ys in the ro om, and the c aregiv er and child sp end some time alone in
the ro om. After the child has had time to e xplore her surroundings , a s trang er enters the ro om. The mother
then le aves her b aby with the s trang er. After a f ew minutes , she returns to c omf ort her child .
Base d on ho w the infants /toddlers resp onde d to the sep aration and reunion , Ains worth identifie d three typ es
of parent -child a ttachments: secure , avoidant , and resis tant (Ains worth & Bell , 1970). A f ourth style, kno wn as
disorg aniz ed attachment , was la ter describ ed (Main & Solomon , 1990). The mos t common typ e of
attachment —also c onsidere d the he althies t—is c alledsecure attachment (Figure 9.14 ). In this typ e of
attachment , the to ddler pref ers his p arent o ver a s trang er. The a ttachment figure is use d as a secure b ase to
explore the en vironment and is sought out in times o f stres s. Securely a ttache d children w ere dis tres sed when
their c aregiv ers left the ro om in the Strang e Situa tion e xperiment , but when their c aregiv ers returne d, the
securely a ttache d children w ere happ y to see them . Securely a ttache d children ha ve caregiv ers who are
sensitiv e and resp onsiv e to their nee ds.302 9 • Lif espan De velopment

explor e his en vironment. (cr edit: K erry Ces zyk)
Withavoidant attachment , the child is unresp onsiv e to the p arent , does not use the p arent as a secure b ase,
and do es not c are if the p arent le aves. The to ddler re acts to the p arent the same w ay she re acts to a s trang er.
When the p arent do es return , the child is slo w to sho w a p ositiv e re action . Ains worth theoriz ed tha t these
children w ere mos t lik ely to ha ve a c aregiv er who w as insensitiv e and ina ttentiv e to their nee ds (Ains worth,
Blehar , Waters , & W all, 1978).
In cases o fresis tant attachment , children tend to sho w cling y behavior , but then the y reject the a ttachment
figure ’s attempts to interact with them (Ains worth & Bell , 1970). These children do not e xplore the to ys in the
room, as the y are to o fearful. During sep aration in the Strang e Situa tion , the y became e xtremely dis turb ed and
angr y with the p arent . When the p arent returns , the children are difficult to c omf ort. Resis tant a ttachment is
the result o f the c aregiv ers’ inc onsis tent lev el of resp onse to their child .
Finally , children with disor ganiz ed attachment behaved oddly in the Strang e Situa tion . The y free ze, run
around the ro om in an erra tic manner , or tr y to r un a way when the c aregiv er returns (Main & Solomon , 1990).
This typ e of attachment is seen mos t often in kids who ha ve been a buse d. Research has sho wn tha t abuse
disr upts a child ’s ability to regula te their emotions .
While Ains worth’s rese arch has f ound supp ort in subse quent s tudies , it has also met criticism . Some
rese archers ha ve pointe d out tha t a child ’s temp erament ma y ha ve a s trong influenc e on a ttachment (Ger vai,

Self -Concept
Just as a ttachment is the main ps ychoso cial miles tone o f infancy , the primar y ps ychoso cial miles tone o f
childho od is the dev elopment o f a p ositiv e sense o f self. Ho w do es self -awarenes s dev elop? Infants don ’t ha ve a
self-concept, which is an unders tanding o f who the y are . If y ou plac e a b aby in front o f a mirror , the y will re ach
out to touch their ima ge, thinking it is another b aby. Ho wever, by about 18 months a to ddler will rec ogniz e tha t
the p erson in the mirror is themself. Ho w do w e kno w this? In a w ell-kno wn e xperiment , a rese archer plac ed a
red dot o f paint on children ’s noses b efore put ting them in front o f a mirror (Ams terdam , 1972). C ommonly

evidenc e of self -rec ognition (Archer , 1992). A t 18 months old the y would touch their o wn noses when the y sa w
the p aint , surprise d to see a sp ot on their fac es. By 24–36 months old children c an name and/or p oint to
themselv es in pictures , cle arly indic ating self -rec ognition .
Children from 2–4 y ears old displa y a gre at incre ase in so cial b ehavior onc e the y ha ve es tablishe d a self -
concept. The y enjo y pla ying with other children , but the y ha ve difficulty sharing their p ossessions . Also,
through pla y children e xplore and c ome to unders tand their g ender roles and c an la bel themselv es as a girl or
boy (Chick , Heilman-Houser , & Hunter , 2002). B y 4 y ears old , children c an c ooperate with other children , share
when ask ed, and sep arate from p arents with lit tle anxiety . Children a t this a ge also e xhibit a utonom y, initia te
tasks , and c arry out plans . Suc cess in these are as c ontributes to a p ositiv e sense o f self. Onc e children re ach 6
years old , the y can identif y themselv es in terms o f group memb erships: “I’ m a firs t grader!” Scho ol-a ge
children c omp are themselv es to their p eers and disc over tha t the y are c omp etent in some are as and les s so in
others (rec all Erikson ’s task o f indus try versus inf eriority ). At this a ge, children rec ogniz e their o wn p ersonality
traits as w ell as some other traits the y would lik e to ha ve. For e xample , 10- year-old La yla sa ys, “I’m kind o f shy.
I wish I c ould b e more talka tive lik e my friend A lexa.”
Dev elopment o f a p ositiv e self -concept is imp ortant to he alth y dev elopment . Children with a p ositiv e self -
concept tend to b e more c onfident , do b etter in scho ol, act more indep endently , and are more willing to tr y
new activities (Mac coby, 1980; F errer & F ugate, 2003). F orma tion o f a p ositiv e self -concept b egins in Erikson ’s
toddlerho od stage, when children es tablish a utonom y and b ecome c onfident in their a bilities . Dev elopment o f
self-concept c ontinues in elementar y scho ol, when children c omp are themselv es to others . When the
comp arison is fa vorable, children f eel a sense o f comp etenc e and are motiv ated to w ork harder and
accomplish more . Self -concept is re -evalua ted in Erikson ’s adolesc ence stage, as teens f orm an identity . The y
internaliz e the mes sages the y ha ve rec eived reg arding their s trengths and w eaknes ses, keeping some
mes sages and rejecting others . Adolesc ents who ha ve achiev ed identity f orma tion are c apable o f contributing

Some theories ha ve been de veloped t o explain the beha viors o f ethnic minority y outh. One such theor y is the
Phenomenological V ariant o f Ecological Sy stems Theor y (PVES T), put f orth by Mar garet Beale Spenc er. It is a
merging o f phenomenolog y and Br onfenbr enner ’s ecological s ystems theor y. A phenomenological appr oach is
based on ho w a person mak es meaning o f their e xperienc es. For example , young African American bo ys ha ve
different e xperienc es in educational set tings c ompar ed to African American girls . Consequentl y, the meaning
they assign t o those e xperienc es diff ers. Bronfenbr enner ’s ecological s ystems theor y sug gests that de velopment
occurs based on int eractions among en vironments such as school , famil y, and c ommunity (Br onfenbr enner ,
1977).
The r esear ch that Spenc er, Dupr ee, and Har tmann (1997) c onduct ed with African American adolesc ent bo ys and
girls w as e xplained b y PVES T. The y found that neg ative learning at titudes w ere predict ed b y unpopularity with
peers f or girls and bo ys. Additional ly, for bo ys, mor e stress predict ed a les s neg ative attitude t oward learning ,
possibly due t o focus on the school en vironment ins tead o f on personal is sues . This oc curr ed along with
perceiving that t eachers had positiv e expectations o f African American bo ys. The r esear chers surmised that
PVES T ac count ed for ho w others’ per ceptions and their subsequent at titudes w ere related and w orked both
ways.
Wha t can p arents do to nur ture a he alth y self -concept? Diana Ba umrind (1971, 1991) thinks p arenting s tyle
may be a factor . The w ay we parent is an imp ortant factor in a child ’s so cioemotional gro wth . Baumrind
develop ed and refine d a theor y describing f our p arenting s tyles: a uthorita tive, authoritarian , permis sive, and
unin volved. With the authoritat ive style, the p arent giv es re asona ble demands and c onsis tent limits ,
expres ses w armth and a ffection , and lis tens to the child ’s point o f view . Parents set r ules and e xplain the
reasons b ehind them . The y are also fle xible and willing to mak e exceptions to the r ules in c ertain c ases —for
example , temp orarily relaxing b edtime r ules to allo w for a night time s wim during a family v acation . Of the f our
parenting s tyles , the a uthorita tive style is the one tha t is mos t enc oura ged in mo dern Americ an so ciety .
Americ an children raise d by authorita tive parents tend to ha ve high self -esteem and so cial skills . Ho wever,
effectiv e parenting s tyles v ary as a function o f culture and , as Small (1999) p oints out , the a uthorita tive style is
not nec essarily pref erre d or appropria te in all cultures .
Inauthoritarian s tyle, the p arent plac es high v alue on c onformity and ob edienc e. The p arents are o ften s trict ,
tightly monitor their children , and e xpres s little w armth . In c ontras t to the a uthorita tive style, authoritarian
parents prob ably w ould not relax b edtime r ules during a v acation b ecause the y consider the r ules to b e set ,
and the y expect ob edienc e. This s tyle c an cre ate anxious , withdra wn, and unhapp y kids . Ho wever, it is
imp ortant to p oint out tha t authoritarian p arenting is as b eneficial as the a uthorita tive style in some ethnic
groups (R ussell, Crockett, & Chao , 2010). F or ins tanc e, firs t-genera tion Chinese Americ an children raise d by
authoritarian p arents did jus t as w ell in scho ol as their p eers who w ere raise d by authorita tive parents (R ussell
et al ., 2010).
For p arents who emplo y the permis sive styleof parenting , the kids r un the sho w and an ything g oes.
Permis sive parents mak e few demands and rarely use punishment . The y tend to b e very nur turing and lo ving ,
and ma y pla y the role o f friend ra ther than p arent . In terms o f our e xample o f vacation b edtimes , permis sive
parents might not ha ve bedtime r ules a t all—ins tead the y allo w the child to cho ose their b edtime whether on
vacation or not . Not surprisingly , children raise d by permis sive parents tend to lack self -discipline , and the
permis sive parenting s tyle is neg atively as sociated with grades (Dornbusch , Rit ter, Leiderman , Roberts, &9.3 • S tages o f De velopment 305
Fraleigh , 1987). The p ermis sive style ma y also c ontribute to other risky b ehaviors such as alc ohol a buse (Bahr
& Ho ffman , 2010), risky se xual b ehavior esp ecially among f emale children (Donenb erg, Wilson , Emerson , &
Bryant, 2002), and incre ased displa y of disr uptiv e behaviors b y male children (P arent et al ., 2011). Ho wever,
there are some p ositiv e outc omes as sociated with children raise d by permis sive parents . The y tend to ha ve
higher self -esteem , better so cial skills , and rep ort lower lev els o f depres sion (Darling , 1999).
With the unin volved styleof parenting , the p arents are indiff erent , unin volved, and sometimes ref erre d to as
neglectful . The y don ’t resp ond to the child ’s nee ds and mak e rela tively f ew demands . This c ould b e because o f
severe depres sion or subs tanc e abuse , or other factors such as the p arents’ e xtreme f ocus on w ork. These
parents ma y pro vide f or the child ’s basic nee ds, but lit tle else . The children raise d in this p arenting s tyle are
usually emotionally withdra wn, fearful, anxious , perform p oorly in scho ol, and are a t an incre ased risk o f
subs tanc e abuse (Darling , 1999).
As y ou c an see , parenting s tyles influenc e childho od adjus tment , but c ould a child ’s temp erament lik ewise
influenc e parenting? Temp erament refers to inna te traits tha t influenc e ho w one thinks , behaves, and re acts
with the en vironment . Children with e asy temp eraments demons trate p ositiv e emotions , adapt w ell to chang e,
and are c apable o f regula ting their emotions . Conversely , children with difficult temp eraments demons trate
negative emotions and ha ve difficulty adapting to chang e and regula ting their emotions . Difficult children are
much more lik ely to challeng e parents , teachers , and other c aregiv ers ( Thomas , 1984). Theref ore, it’s possible
that easy children (i .e., so cial, adapta ble, and e asy to so othe) tend to elicit w arm and resp onsiv e parenting ,
while demanding , irrita ble, withdra wn children ev oke irrita tion in their p arents or c ause their p arents to
withdra w (Sanson & R othb art, 1995).
The Importance of Play and R ecess
According t o the American Academ y of Pediatrics (2007), uns tructur ed pla y is an int egral par t of a child’ s
development. It builds cr eativity , problem sol ving skil ls, and social r elationships . Pla y also al lows childr en to
develop a theor y-of-mind as the y imaginativ ely tak e on the perspectiv e of others .
Outdoor pla y allows childr en the oppor tunity t o dir ectly experienc e and sense the w orld ar ound them. While
doing so , the y ma y collect objects that the y come acr oss and de velop lif elong int erests and hobbies . The y also
benefit fr om incr eased e xercise, and eng aging in out door pla y can actual ly incr ease ho w much the y enjo y

suggests that t oday’s childr en ar e eng aging in les s and les s out door pla y (Clements , 2004). P erhaps , it is no

with lit tle nutritional v alue ar e contributing t o alarming le vels o f childhood obesity (K arnik & K anek ar, 2012).
Despit e the adv erse c onsequenc es as sociat ed with r educ ed pla y, some childr en ar e over scheduled and ha ve
little fr ee time t o eng age in uns tructur ed pla y. In addition, some schools ha ve tak en a way recess time f or childr en

Physical Development
As note d above, adolesc ence begins with pub erty. While the se quenc e of ph ysical chang es in pub erty is
predicta ble, the onset and p ace of pub erty vary widely . Sev eral ph ysical chang es o ccur during pub erty, such as
adrenarche and gonadarche , the ma turing o f the adrenal glands and se x glands , resp ectiv ely. Also during this
time , primar y and sec ondar y se xual characteris tics dev elop and ma ture .Primar y se xual characteris ticsare

Secondar y se xual characteris ticsare ph ysical signs o f sexual ma tura tion tha t do not directly in volve se x
organs, such as dev elopment o f bre asts and hips in f emales , and dev elopment o f facial hair and a deep ened
voice in males . Females e xperienc emenarche , the b eginning o f mens trual p erio ds, usually around 12–13
years old , and males e xperienc espermarche , the firs t ejacula tion , around 13–14 y ears old .
During pub erty, people e xperienc e a rapid incre ase in height (i .e., gro wth spur t). F or females this b egins
between 8 and 13 y ears old , with adult height re ache d between 10 and 16 y ears old . Males b egin their gro wth
spur t slightly la ter, usually b etween 10 and 16 y ears old , and re ach their adult height b etween 13 and 17 y ears
old. Both na ture (i .e., genes) and nur ture (e .g., nutrition , me dications , and me dical conditions) c an influenc e
height .
Because ra tes o f ph ysical dev elopment v ary so widely among teena gers, pub erty can b e a sourc e of pride or
emb arras sment . Early ma turing b oys tend to b e strong er, taller , and more a thletic than their la ter ma turing
peers . The y are usually more p opular , confident , and indep endent , but the y are also a t a gre ater risk f or
subs tanc e abuse and e arly se xual activity (Flanner y, Rowe, & Gulle y, 1993; K altiala-Heino , Rimp ela, Ris sanen ,
& Rantanen , 2001). Early ma turing girls ma y be teased or o vertly admire d, which c an c ause them to f eel self -
conscious a bout their dev eloping b odies . These girls are a t a higher risk f or depres sion , subs tanc e abuse , and
eating disorders (Ge , Cong er, & Elder , 2001; Gra ber, Lewinsohn , Seele y, & Bro oks-Gunn , 1997; Strieg el-Mo ore &
Cachelin , 1999). La te blo oming b oys and girls (i .e., the y dev elop more slo wly than their p eers) ma y feel self -
conscious a bout their lack o f ph ysical dev elopment . Negative feelings are p articularly a problem f or la te
maturing b oys, who are a t a higher risk f or depres sion and c onflict with p arents (Gra ber et al ., 1997) and more
likely to b e bullie d (P ollack & Shus ter, 2000).
Psychologis ts and clinicians also s tudy the imp act o f gender identity and the imp acts o f pub erty on
trans gender and g ender -nonc onforming y outh . This is a rela tively rec ent are a of study , and the imp acts should
not b e over-generaliz ed. Ho wever, the rese arch seems to indic ate tha t trans gender and g ender -nonc onforming
youth who are supp orted in their identity do not ha ve signific antly higher incidenc es o f depres sion or anxiety
symptoms when c omp ared to c ontrol groups , while those who are not supp orted exhibit more s ymptoms and
risk factors (Olson , Dur wood, & McLa ughlin , 2016). Expres sion and e xplora tion o f gender identity c an tak e
man y forms and manif est at diff erent times dep ending on a wide arra y of factors .
The adolesc ent brain also remains under dev elopment . Up until pub erty, brain c ells c ontinue to blo om in the
frontal region . Adolesc ents eng age in incre ased risk -taking b ehaviors and emotional outburs ts possibly
because the frontal lob es o f their brains are s till dev eloping ( Figure 9.16 ). Recall tha t this are a is resp onsible
for judgment , impulse c ontrol , and planning , and it is s till ma turing into e arly adultho od (C asey, Tottenham ,9.3 • S tages o f De velopment 307

Cognitive Development
More c omple x thinking a bilities emerg e during adolesc ence. Some rese archers sugg est this is due to incre ases
in pro cessing sp eed and efficiency ra ther than as the result o f an incre ase in mental c apacity —in other w ords ,
due to impro vements in e xisting skills ra ther than dev elopment o f new ones (Bjorkland , 1987; C ase, 1985).
During adolesc ence, teena gers mo ve beyond c oncrete thinking and b ecome c apable o f abstract thought . Recall
that Pia get ref ers to this s tage as f ormal op erational thought . Teen thinking is also characteriz ed by the a bility
to consider multiple p oints o f view , ima gine h ypothetic al situa tions , deb ate ide as and opinions (e .g., politics ,
religion , and jus tice), and f orm new ide as (Figure 9.17 ). In addition , it’s not unc ommon f or adolesc ents to
ques tion a uthority or challeng e es tablishe d so cietal norms .
Cognit ive emp athy, also kno wn as theor y-of-mind ( which w e discus sed earlier with reg ard to eg ocentrism),

Psychosocial Development
Adolesc ents c ontinue to refine their sense o f self as the y rela te to others . Erikson ref erre d to the task o f the
adolesc ent as one o f identity v ersus role c onfusion . Thus , in Erikson ’s view , an adolesc ent’s main ques tions are
“Who am I? ” and “ Who do I w ant to b e?” Some adolesc ents adopt the v alues and roles tha t their p arents e xpect
for them . Other teens dev elop identities tha t are in opp osition to their p arents but align with a p eer group . This
is common as p eer rela tionships b ecome a c entral f ocus in adolesc ents’ liv es.
As adolesc ents w ork to f orm their identities , the y pull a way from their p arents , and the p eer group b ecomes
very imp ortant (Shanahan , McHale , Osgood, & C router , 2007). Despite sp ending les s time with their p arents ,
mos t teens rep ort positiv e feelings to ward them (Mo ore, Guzman , Hair , Lippman , & G arret t, 2004). W arm and
health y parent -child rela tionships ha ve been as sociated with p ositiv e child outc omes , such as b etter grades
and f ewer scho ol behavior problems , in the Unite d Sta tes as w ell as in other c ountries (Hair et al ., 2005).
It app ears tha t mos t teens don ’t experienc e adolesc ent s torm and s tres s to the degree onc e famously sugg ested
by G. Stanle y Hall , a pioneer in the s tudy o f adolesc ent dev elopment . Only small numb ers o f teens ha ve major
conflicts with their p arents (Steinb erg & Morris , 2001), and mos t disa greements are minor . For e xample , in a
study o f over 1,800 p arents o f adolesc ents from v arious cultural and ethnic groups , Barb er (1994) f ound tha t
conflicts o ccurre d over da y-to-day issues such as homew ork, mone y, cur fews, clothing , chores , and friends .
These typ es o f arguments tend to decre ase as teens dev elop (G alamb os & A lmeida, 1992). There is emerging
rese arch on the adolesc ent brain . Galvan, Hare , Voss, Glo ver and C asey (2007) e xamine d its role in risk -taking
behavior . The y use d fMRI to as sess the re adings’ rela tionship to risk -taking , risk p erception , and impulsivity .
The rese archers f ound tha t there w as no c orrela tion b etween brain activity in the neural rew ard c enter and
impulsivity and risk p erception . Ho wever, activity in tha t part of the brain w as c orrela ted to risk taking . In
other w ords , risk -taking adolesc ents e xperienc ed brain activity in the rew ard c enter . The ide a tha t adolesc ents ,
however, are more impulsiv e than other demographics w as challeng ed in their rese arch , which include d
children and adults .
Emerging Adulthood
The ne xt stage of dev elopment is emer ging adultho od. This is a rela tively newly define d perio d of lifespan
development sp anning from 18 y ears old to the mid-20s , characteriz ed as an in-b etween time where identity
explora tion is f ocuse d on w ork and lo ve.
When do es a p erson b ecome an adult? There are man y ways to ans wer this ques tion . In the Unite d Sta tes, you
are leg ally c onsidere d an adult a t 18 y ears old . But other definitions o f adultho od vary widely; in so ciolog y, for
example , a p erson ma y be considere d an adult when the y become self -supp orting , cho ose a c areer , get
marrie d, or s tart a family . The a ges a t which w e achiev e these miles tones v ary from p erson to p erson as w ell as
from culture to culture . For e xample , in the Afric an c ountr y of Mala wi, 15- year-old Njemile w as marrie d at 14
years old and had her firs t child a t 15 y ears old . In her culture she is c onsidere d an adult . Children in Mala wi

effectiv ely dela ying the onset o f adult lif e.
Wha t factors are le ading to these chang es reg arding financial and familial indep endenc e? It seems tha t
emerging adultho od is a pro duct o f both W estern culture and our current times (Arnet t, 2000). P eople in
higher inc ome and more indus trializ ed countries are living long er, allo wing the free dom to tak e an e xtra
decade to s tart a c areer and family . Chang es in the w orkf orce also pla y a role . For e xample , 50 y ears a go, a
young adult with a high scho ol diploma c ould imme diately enter the w ork f orce and climb the ec onomic
ladder . Tha t is no long er the c ase. Bachelor ’s and ev en gradua te degrees are re quire d more and more
often— even f or entr y-lev el jobs (Arnet t, 2000). In addition , man y students are taking long er (fiv e or six y ears)
to complete a c olleg e degree as a result o f working and g oing to scho ol at the same time . After gradua tion ,
man y young adults return to the family home b ecause the y ha ve difficulty finding a job . The term Bo omerang
Genera tion describ es rec ent c olleg e gradua tes f or whom lack o f ade qua te emplo yment up on c olleg e
gradua tion o ften le ads to a return to the p arental home (Da vidson , 2014). Changing cultural e xpecta tions ma y
be the mos t imp ortant re ason f or the dela y in entering adult roles . Young p eople are sp ending more time
exploring their options , so the y are dela ying marria ge and w ork as the y chang e majors and jobs multiple
times , put ting them on a much la ter timeta ble than their p arents (Arnet t, 2000).
Adulthood
Adultho od begins around 20 y ears old and has three dis tinct s tages: e arly , middle , and la te. Each s tage brings
its o wn set o f rew ards and challeng es.
Physical Development
By the time w e re ach e arly adultho od (20 to e arly 40s), our ph ysical ma tura tion is c omplete , although our
height and w eight ma y incre ase slightly . In y oung adultho od, our ph ysical abilities are a t their p eak, including
muscle s trength , reaction time , sensor y abilities , and c ardiac functioning . Mos t pro fessional a thletes are a t the
top o f their g ame during this s tage. Man y women ha ve children in the y oung adultho od years, so the y ma y see
additional w eight g ain and bre ast chang es.
Middle adultho od extends from the 40s to the 60s ( Figure 9.18 ). Ph ysical decline is gradual . The skin loses
some elas ticity , and wrinkles are among the firs t signs o f aging . Visual acuity decre ases during this time .
Women e xperienc e a gradual decline in f ertility as the y appro ach the onset o f menop ause, the end o f the
mens trual cy cle, around 50 y ears old . Both men and w omen tend to g ain w eight: in the a bdominal are a for

Late adultho od is c onsidere d to e xtend from the 60s on . This is the las t stage of ph ysical chang e. The skin
continues to lose elas ticity , reaction time slo ws fur ther , and muscle s trength diminishes . Smell , tas te, hearing ,

Unlik e our ph ysical abilities , which p eak in our mid-20s and then b egin a slo w decline , our c ognitiv e abilities

Psychosocial Development
There are man y theories a bout the so cial and emotional asp ects o f aging . Some asp ects o f he alth y aging
include activities , social c onnecte dnes s, and the role o f a p erson ’s culture . According to man y theoris ts,
including Georg e Vaillant (2002), who s tudie d and analyz ed over 50 y ears o f data, w e nee d to ha ve and
continue to find me aning throughout our liv es. For those in e arly and middle adultho od, me aning is f ound
through w ork (Sterns & Huy ck, 2001) and family lif e (Mark us, Ryff, Curan , & P almersheim , 2004). These are as
rela te to the tasks tha t Erikson ref erre d to as g enera tivity and intimacy . As mentione d previously , adults tend
to define themselv es b y wha t the y do —their c areers . Earnings p eak during this time , yet job sa tisfaction is
more closely tie d to w ork tha t involves c ontact with other p eople , is interes ting , pro vides opp ortunities f or
advancement , and allo ws some indep endenc e (Mohr & Z oghi , 2006) than it is to salar y (Iy engar, Wells, &
Schwartz, 2006). Ho w might b eing unemplo yed or b eing in a de ad-end job challeng e adult w ell-b eing?
Positiv e rela tionships with signific ant others in our adult y ears ha ve been f ound to c ontribute to a s tate of well-
being (R yff & Sing er, 2009). Mos t adults in the Unite d Sta tes identif y themselv es through their rela tionships
with family —particularly with sp ouses , children , and p arents (Mark us et al ., 2004). While raising children c an
be stres sful, esp ecially when the y are y oung , rese arch sugg ests tha t parents re ap the rew ards do wn the ro ad,
as adult children tend to ha ve a p ositiv e eff ect on p arental w ell-b eing (Umb erson , Pudro vska, & R eczek, 2010).
Having a s table marria ge has also b een f ound to c ontribute to w ell-b eing throughout adultho od (Vaillant ,
2002).
Another asp ect o f positiv e aging is b eliev ed to b e so cial c onnecte dnes s and so cial supp ort. As w e get older ,
socioemot ional select ivity theor ysugg ests tha t our so cial supp ort and friendships dwindle in numb er, but
remain as close , if not more close than in our e arlier y ears (C arstensen , 1992) ( Figure 9.20 ).

9.4 Death and Dying
LEARNING OBJEC TIVES
By the end o f this section, y ou wil l be able t o:
•Discus s hospic e car e
•Describe the fiv e stages o f grief
•Critique is sues r egarding living wil ls, Do Not R esuscitat e (DNR) or ders , and hospic e car e
Every story has an ending . De ath marks the end o f your lif e story (Figure 9.21 ). Our culture and individual
backgrounds influenc e ho w w e view de ath. In some cultures , death is ac cepte d as a na tural p art of life and is
embrac ed. In c ontras t, until a bout 50 y ears a go in the Unite d Sta tes, a do ctor might not inf orm someone tha t
they were dying , and the majority o f deaths o ccurre d in hospitals . In 1967 tha t reality b egan to chang e with
Cicely Sa unders , who cre ated the firs t mo dern hospic ein England . The aim o f hospic e is to help pro vide a
death with dignity and p ain mana gement in a humane and c omf ortable en vironment , which is usually outside
of a hospital set ting . In 1974, Florenc e Wald f ounde d the firs t hospic e in the Unite d Sta tes. Today, hospic e
provides c are f or 1.65 million Americ ans and their families . Bec ause o f hospic e care, man y terminally ill
people are a ble to sp end their las t days at home .
FIGURE 9.21 Different cul tures, societies , and r eligions ha ve varying pr actic es surr ounding death. F or example ,
people ’s bodies ma y be (a) buried in a c emet ery, (b) cr emat ed and buried at sea as in this U .S. Na vy ceremon y, or (c)
cremat ed such as in this Hindu c eremon y in Bali. (cr edit a: modification o f work b y Chris tina Rutz; cr edit b:

Research has indic ated tha t hospic e care is b eneficial f or the p atient (Br umle y, Enquidanos , & Cherin , 2003;
Brumle y et al ., 2007; Go dkin , Krant , & Dos ter, 1984) and f or the p atient ’s family (Rho des, Mitchell , Miller ,
Connor , & T eno, 2008; Go dkin et al ., 1984). Hospic e patients rep ort high lev els o f satisfaction with hospic e care
because the y are a ble to remain a t home and are not c ompletely dep endent on s trang ers f or c are (Br umle y et
al., 2007). In addition , hospic e patients tend to liv e long er than non-hospic e patients (C onnor , Pyenson , Fitch ,
Spence, & Iw asaki , 2007; T emel et al ., 2010). F amily memb ers rec eive emotional supp ort and are regularly
informe d of their lo ved one ’s tre atment and c ondition . The family memb er’s burden o f care is also re duced
(McMillan et al ., 2006). Both the p atient and the p atient ’s family memb ers rep ort incre ased family supp ort,
incre ased so cial supp ort, and impro ved coping while rec eiving hospic e ser vices (Go dkin et al ., 1984).
How do y ou think y ou might re act if y ou w ere dia gnose d with a terminal illnes s lik e cancer? Eliza beth K übler -
Ross (1969), who w orked with the f ounders o f hospic e care, describ ed the pro cess of an individual ac cepting
his o wn de ath. She prop osed fiv e stages o f grief: denial , ang er, bargaining , depres sion , and ac ceptanc e. Mos t
individuals e xperienc e these s tages, but the s tages ma y occur in diff erent orders , dep ending on the individual .
In addition , not all p eople e xperienc e all o f the s tages. It is also imp ortant to note tha t some ps ychologis ts
believ e tha t the more a dying p erson fights de ath, the more lik ely the y are to remain s tuck in the denial phase .9.4 • Dea th and Dying 313
This c ould mak e it difficult f or the dying p erson to fac e de ath with dignity . Ho wever, other ps ychologis ts
believ e tha t not facing de ath until the v ery end is an adaptiv e coping mechanism f or some p eople .
Whether due to illnes s or old a ge, not ev eryone facing de ath or the los s of a lo ved one e xperienc es the neg ative
emotions outline d in the K übler -Ross mo del (N olen-Ho eksema & Larson , 1999). F or e xample , rese arch
sugg ests tha t people with religious or spiritual b eliefs are b etter a ble to c ope with de ath b ecause o f their hop e
in an a fterlif e and b ecause o f social supp ort from religious or spiritual as sociations (Ho od, Spilka, Hunsb erger,
& Corsuch , 1996; McIntosh , Silv er, & W ortman , 1993; P aloutzian , 1996; Samarel , 1991; W ortman & P ark,
2008).
A prominent e xample o f a p erson cre ating me aning through de ath is Randy P ausch , who w as a w ell-lo ved and
resp ecte d pro fessor a t Carnegie Mellon Univ ersity . Dia gnose d with terminal p ancre atic c ancer in his mid-40s

disc ontinuous , whether dev elopment f ollows one c ourse or man y, and the rela tive influenc e of na ture v ersus
nurture on dev elopment .
9.2 Lifespan Theories
There are man y theories reg arding ho w babies and children gro w and dev elop into happ y, health y adults .
Sigmund F reud sugg ested tha t we pass through a series o f psychose xual s tages in which our energ y is f ocuse d
on c ertain erog enous z ones on the b ody. Eric Erikson mo difie d Freud ’s ide as and sugg ested a theor y of
psychoso cial dev elopment . Erikson said tha t our so cial interactions and suc cessful c ompletion o f social tasks
shap e our sense o f self. J ean Pia get prop osed a theor y of cognitiv e dev elopment tha t explains ho w children
think and re ason as the y mo ve through v arious s tages. Finally , Lawrenc e Kohlb erg turne d his a ttention to
moral dev elopment . He said tha t we pass through three lev els o f moral thinking tha t build on our c ognitiv e
development .
9.3 Stages of Development
At conception the egg and sp erm c ell are unite d to f orm a zy gote, which will b egin to divide rapidly . This marks
the b eginning o f the firs t stage of prena tal dev elopment ( germinal s tage), which las ts about tw o weeks . Then
the zy gote implants itself into the lining o f the uter us, marking the b eginning o f the sec ond s tage of prena tal
development (embr yonic s tage), which las ts about six w eeks . The embr yo begins to dev elop b ody and org an
structures , and the neural tub e forms , which will la ter b ecome the brain and spinal c ord. The third phase o f
prena tal dev elopment (f etal s tage) begins a t 9 w eeks and las ts until bir th. The b ody, brain , and org ans gro w
rapidly during this s tage. During all s tages o f pregnancy it is imp ortant tha t the p arent rec eive prena tal c are to
reduce he alth risks to themself and to the dev eloping b aby.
Newb orn infants w eigh a bout 7.5 p ounds . Do ctors as sess a newb orn’s refle xes, such as the sucking , rooting ,
and Moro refle xes. Our ph ysical, cognitiv e, and ps ychoso cial skills gro w and chang e as w e mo ve through
developmental s tages from infancy through la te adultho od. Attachment in infancy is a critic al comp onent o f
health y dev elopment . Parenting s tyles ha ve been f ound to ha ve an eff ect on childho od outc omes o f well-b eing .
The transition from adolesc ence to adultho od can b e challenging due to the timing o f pub erty, and due to the
extende d amount o f time sp ent in emerging adultho od. Although ph ysical decline b egins in middle adultho od,
cognitiv e decline do es not b egin until la ter. Activities tha t keep the b ody and mind activ e can help maintain
good ph ysical and c ognitiv e he alth as w e age. Social supp orts through family and friends remain imp ortant as

LEARNING OBJEC TIVES
By the end o f this section, y ou wil l be able t o:
•Define intrinsic and e xtrinsic motiv ation
•Unders tand that ins tincts , driv e reduction, self-efficacy , and social motiv es ha ve all been pr oposed as theories
of motiv ation
•Explain the basic c oncepts as sociat ed with Maslo w’s hier archy of needs
Why do w e do the things w e do? Wha t motiv ations underlie our b ehaviors? Mot ivation describ es the w ants or
needs tha t direct b ehavior to ward a g oal. In addition to biologic al motiv es, motiv ations c an b eintrinsic
(arising from internal factors) or extrinsic (arising from e xternal factors) ( Figure 10.2 ). Intrinsic ally motiv ated
behaviors are p erforme d because o f the sense o f personal sa tisfaction tha t the y bring , while e xtrinsic ally
motiv ated behaviors are p erforme d in order to rec eive something from others .
FIGURE 10.2 Intrinsic motiv ation c omes fr om within the individual , while e xtrinsic motiv ation c omes fr om outside
the individual .
Think a bout wh y you are pursuing an e ducation . Are y ou here b ecause y ou enjo y learning and w ant to pursue
an e ducation to mak e yourself a more w ell-rounde d individual? If so , then y ou are intrinsic ally motiv ated.
However, if y ou are here b ecause y ou w ant to g et a c olleg e degree to mak e yourself more mark etable f or a high-
paying c areer or to sa tisfy the demands o f your p arents , then y our motiv ation is more e xtrinsic in na ture .
In re ality , our motiv ations are o ften a mix o f both intrinsic and e xtrinsic factors , but the na ture o f the mix o f
these factors might chang e over time (o ften in w ays tha t seem c ounter -intuitiv e). There is an old ada ge:
“Cho ose a job tha t you lo ve, and y ou will nev er ha ve to w ork a da y in y our lif e,” me aning tha t if y ou enjo y your
occup ation , work do esn’t seem lik e . . . w ell, work. Some rese arch sugg ests tha t this isn ’t nec essarily the c ase
(Daniel & Es ser, 1980; Deci , 1972; Deci , Koestner , & R yan, 1999). A ccording to this rese arch , rec eiving some
sort of extrinsic reinf orcement (i .e., getting p aid) f or eng aging in b ehaviors tha t we enjo y leads to those
behaviors b eing thought o f as w ork no long er pro viding tha t same enjo yment . As a result , we might sp end les s
time eng aging in these reclas sifie d behaviors in the a bsenc e of an y extrinsic reinf orcement . For e xample ,
Odes sa lo ves b aking , so in her free time , she b akes for fun . Oftentimes , after s tocking shelv es a t her gro cery
store job , she o ften whips up p astries in the ev enings b ecause she enjo ys baking . When a c oworker in the
store ’s bakery dep artment le aves his job , Odes sa applies f or his p osition and g ets trans ferre d to the b akery
dep artment . Although she enjo ys wha t she do es in her new job , after a f ew months , she no long er has much
desire to c oncoct tas ty tre ats in her free time . Baking has b ecome w ork in a w ay tha t chang es her motiv ation to
do it ( Figure 10.3 ). Wha t Odes sa has e xperienc ed is c alled the o verjus tific ation eff ect—intrinsic motiv ation is
diminishe d when e xtrinsic motiv ation is giv en. This c an le ad to e xtinguishing the intrinsic motiv ation and
creating a dep endenc e on e xtrinsic rew ards f or c ontinue d performanc e (Deci et al ., 1999).322 10 • Emo tion and Mo tivation

FIGURE 10.3 Resear ch sug gests that when something w e love to do , like icing cak es, bec omes our job , our intrinsic
and e xtrinsic motiv ations t o do it ma y chang e. (credit: Ag ustín Ruiz)
Other s tudies sugg est tha t intrinsic motiv ation ma y not b e so vulnera ble to the eff ects o f extrinsic
reinf orcements , and in fact , reinf orcements such as v erbal praise might actually incre ase intrinsic motiv ation
(Arnold , 1976; C ameron & Pierc e, 1994). In tha t case, Odes sa’s motiv ation to b ake in her free time might
remain high if, f or e xample , cus tomers regularly c ompliment her b aking or c ake dec orating skills .
These app arent discrep ancies in the rese archers’ findings ma y be unders tood by considering sev eral factors .
For one , physical reinf orcement (such as mone y) and v erbal reinf orcement (such as praise) ma y affect an
individual in v ery diff erent w ays. In fact , tangible rew ards (i .e., mone y) tend to ha ve more neg ative eff ects on
intrinsic motiv ation than do intangible rew ards (i .e., praise). F urthermore , the e xpecta tion o f the e xtrinsic
motiv ator b y an individual is cr ucial: If the p erson e xpects to rec eive an e xtrinsic rew ard, then intrinsic
motiv ation f or the task tends to b e re duced. If, ho wever, there is no such e xpecta tion , and the e xtrinsic
motiv ation is presente d as a surprise , then intrinsic motiv ation f or the task tends to p ersis t (Deci et al ., 1999).
In addition , culture ma y influenc e motiv ation . For e xample , in c ollectivis tic cultures , it is c ommon to do things
for y our family memb ers b ecause the emphasis is on the group and wha t is b est for the entire group , rather
than wha t is b est for an y one individual (Nisb ett, Peng, Choi , & N orenza yan, 2001). This f ocus on others
provides a bro ader p ersp ectiv e tha t tak es into ac count b oth situa tional and cultural influenc es on b ehavior;
thus , a more nuanc ed explana tion o f the c auses o f others’ b ehavior b ecomes more lik ely. (You will le arn more
about c ollectivis tic and individualis tic cultures when y ou le arn a bout so cial ps ycholog y.)
In e ducational set tings , students are more lik ely to e xperienc e intrinsic motiv ation to le arn when the y feel a
sense o f belonging and resp ect in the clas sroom. This internaliza tion c an b e enhanc ed if the ev alua tive asp ects
of the clas sroom are de -emphasiz ed and if s tudents f eel tha t the y exercise some c ontrol o ver the le arning
environment . Furthermore , pro viding s tudents with activities tha t are challenging , yet do able, along with a
rationale f or eng aging in v arious le arning activities c an enhanc e intrinsic motiv ation f or those tasks (Niemiec
& Ryan, 2009). C onsider Hakim , a firs t-year la w student with tw o courses this semes ter: F amily La w and
Criminal La w. The F amily La w pro fessor has a ra ther intimida ting clas sroom: He lik es to put s tudents on the
spot with tough ques tions , which o ften le aves students f eeling b elittled or emb arras sed. Grades are b ased
exclusiv ely on quizz es and e xams , and the ins tructor p osts results o f each tes t on the clas sroom do or. In
contras t, the C riminal La w pro fessor facilita tes clas sroom discus sions and resp ectful deb ates in small groups .
The majority o f the c ourse grade is not e xam-b ased, but c enters on a s tudent -designe d rese arch project on a
crime is sue o f the s tudent ’s choic e. Research sugg ests tha t Hakim will b e les s intrinsic ally motiv ated in his
Family La w course , where s tudents are intimida ted in the clas sroom set ting , and there is an emphasis on
teacher -driv en ev alua tions . Hakim is lik ely to e xperienc e a higher lev el of intrinsic motiv ation in his C riminal
Law course , where the clas s set ting enc oura ges inclusiv e collaboration and a resp ect f or ide as, and where
students ha ve more influenc e over their le arning activities .
Theories About Motiv ation
William James (1842–1910) w as an imp ortant c ontributor to e arly rese arch into motiv ation , and he is o ften
referre d to as the fa ther o f psycholog y in the Unite d Sta tes. James theoriz ed tha t behavior w as driv en b y a
numb er o f ins tincts , which aid sur vival (Figure 10.4 ). From a biologic al persp ectiv e, an instinct is a sp ecies -10.1 • Mo tivation 323
specific p attern o f behavior tha t is not le arne d. There w as, however, considera ble c ontro versy among J ames
and his c ontemp oraries o ver the e xact definition o f ins tinct . James prop osed sev eral do zen sp ecial human
instincts , but man y of his c ontemp oraries had their o wn lis ts tha t diff ered. A mother ’s protection o f her b aby,
the urg e to lick sug ar, and hunting pre y were among the human b ehaviors prop osed as tr ue ins tincts during
James’ s era. This view—tha t human b ehavior is driv en b y ins tincts —rec eived a fair amount o f criticism
because o f the undenia ble role o f learning in shaping all sor ts of human b ehavior . In fact , as e arly as the 1900s ,
some ins tinctiv e behaviors w ere e xperimentally demons trated to result from as sociative learning (rec all when
you le arne d about W atson ’s conditioning o f fear resp onse in “Lit tle A lbert”) (F aris , 1921).

instincts . (b) In humans , ins tincts ma y include beha viors such as an infant ’s rooting f or a nipple and sucking . (credit

Another e arly theor y of motiv ation prop osed tha t the maintenanc e of homeos tasis is p articularly imp ortant in
directing b ehavior . You ma y rec all from y our e arlier re ading tha t homeos tasis is the tendency to maintain a
balanc e, or optimal lev el, within a biologic al system . In a b ody s ystem , a c ontrol c enter ( which is o ften p art of
the brain) rec eives input from rec eptors ( which are o ften c omple xes o f neurons). The c ontrol c enter directs
effectors ( which ma y be other neurons) to c orrect an y imb alanc e detecte d by the c ontrol c enter .
According to the driv e theor yof motiv ation , devia tions from homeos tasis cre ate ph ysiologic al nee ds. These
needs result in ps ychologic al driv e states tha t direct b ehavior to meet the nee d and , ultima tely, bring the
system b ack to homeos tasis . For e xample , if it ’s been a while sinc e you a te, your blo od sug ar lev els will drop
below normal . This lo w blo od sug ar will induc e a ph ysiologic al nee d and a c orresp onding driv e state (i .e.,
hung er) tha t will direct y ou to seek out and c onsume f ood (Figure 10.5 ). Ea ting will elimina te the hung er, and ,
ultima tely, your blo od sug ar lev els will return to normal . Interes tingly , driv e theor y also emphasiz es the role
that ha bits pla y in the typ e of behavioral resp onse in which w e eng age. Ahabit is a p attern o f behavior in which
we regularly eng age. Onc e we ha ve eng aged in a b ehavior tha t suc cessfully re duces a driv e, we are more lik ely
to eng age in tha t behavior whenev er fac ed with tha t driv e in the future (Graham & W einer , 1996).

Extensions o f driv e theor y tak e into ac count lev els o f arousal as p otential motiv ators . As y ou rec all from y our
study o f learning , these theories as sert tha t there is an optimal lev el of arousal tha t we all tr y to maintain
(Figure 10.6 ). If w e are underarouse d, we become b ored and will seek out some sor t of stimula tion . On the
other hand , if w e are o verarouse d, we will eng age in b ehaviors to re duce our arousal (Berlyne , 1960). Mos t
students ha ve experienc ed this nee d to maintain optimal lev els o f arousal o ver the c ourse o f their ac ademic
career . Think a bout ho w much s tres s students e xperienc e toward the end o f spring semes ter. The y feel
overwhelme d with seemingly endles s exams , papers, and major as signments tha t mus t be complete d on time .
The y prob ably y earn f or the res t and relaxa tion tha t awaits them o ver the e xtende d summer bre ak. Ho wever,
once the y finish the semes ter, it do esn’t tak e too long b efore the y begin to f eel b ored. Generally , by the time the
next semes ter is b eginning in the fall , man y students are quite happ y to return to scho ol. This is an e xample o f
how arousal theor y works .
FIGURE 10.6 The c oncept of optimal ar ousal in r elation t o per formanc e on a task is depict ed her e. Performanc e is
maximiz ed at the op timal le vel of arousal , and it tapers o ff during under - and o verarousal .
So wha t is the optimal lev el of arousal? Wha t lev el le ads to the b est performanc e? R esearch sho ws tha t
modera te arousal is g enerally b est; when arousal is v ery high or v ery low, performanc e tends to suff er (Yerkes
& Do dson , 1908). Think o f your arousal lev el reg arding taking an e xam f or this clas s. If y our lev el is v ery low,
such as b oredom and ap athy, your p erformanc e will lik ely suff er. Similarly , a v ery high lev el, such as e xtreme
anxiety , can b e paralyzing and hinder p erformanc e. Consider the e xample o f a so ftball te am facing a
tournament . The y are fa vored to win their firs t game b y a larg e margin , so the y go into the g ame with a lo wer
level of arousal and g et beat by a les s skille d team.
But optimal arousal lev el is more c omple x than a simple ans wer tha t the middle lev el is alw ays best.
Researchers R obert Yerkes (pronounc ed “Yerk-EES”) and J ohn Do dson disc overed tha t the optimal arousal
level dep ends on the c omple xity and difficulty o f the task to b e performe d (Figure 10.7 ). This rela tionship is
kno wn as Yerkes-Do dson la w, which holds tha t a simple task is p erforme d best when arousal lev els are
rela tively high and c omple x tasks are b est performe d when arousal lev els are lo wer.10.1 • Mo tivation 325
FIGURE 10.7 Task per formanc e is bes t when ar ousal le vels ar e in a middle r ange, with difficul t task s bes t
performed under lo wer le vels o f arousal and simple task s bes t per formed under higher le vels o f arousal .
Self -efficacy and Social Motives
Self -effic acy is an individual ’s belief in their o wn c apability to c omplete a task , which ma y include a previous
successful c ompletion o f the e xact task or a similar task . AlbertBandura (1994) theoriz ed tha t an individual ’s
sense o f self -effic acy pla ys a piv otal role in motiv ating b ehavior . Bandura argues tha t motiv ation deriv es from
expecta tions tha t we ha ve about the c onse quenc es o f our b ehaviors , and ultima tely, it is the apprecia tion o f our
capacity to eng age in a giv en b ehavior tha t will determine wha t we do and the future g oals tha t we set f or
ourselv es. For e xample , if y ou ha ve a sinc ere b elief in y our a bility to achiev e at the highes t lev el, you are more
likely to tak e on challenging tasks and to not let setb acks dis suade y ou from seeing the task through to the end .
A numb er o f theoris ts ha ve focuse d their rese arch on unders tanding so cial motiv es (Mc Adams & C onstantian ,
1983; McClelland & Lib erman , 1949; Murra y et al ., 1938). Among the motiv es the y describ e are nee ds for
achiev ement , affilia tion , and intimacy . It is the nee d for achiev ement tha t driv es ac complishment and
performanc e. The nee d for a ffilia tion enc oura ges p ositiv e interactions with others , and the nee d for intimacy
causes us to seek deep , me aningful rela tionships . Henr y Murra y et al . (1938) c ategoriz ed these nee ds into
domains . For e xample , the nee d for achiev ement and rec ognition falls under the domain o f ambition .
Dominanc e and a ggres sion w ere rec ogniz ed as nee ds under the domain o f human p ower, and pla y was a
recogniz ed nee d in the domain o f interp ersonal a ffection .
Maslow’ s Hier archy of Needs
While the theories o f motiv ation describ ed earlier rela te to b asic biologic al driv es, individual characteris tics,
or so cial c onte xts, Abraham Maslo w(1943) prop osed ahierarch y of nee dsthat spans the sp ectr um o f motiv es
ranging from the biologic al to the individual to the so cial. These nee ds are o ften depicte d as a p yramid ( Figure
10.8 ).326 10 • Emo tion and Mo tivation
Access for fr ee a t opens tax. org
FIGURE 10.8 Maslo w’s hier archy of needs is il lustrated her e. In some v ersions o f the p yramid, c ognitiv e and
aesthetic needs ar e also included betw een es teem and self-actualization. Others include another tier at the t op o f
the p yramid f or self-tr ansc endenc e.
At the b ase o f the p yramid are all o f the ph ysiologic al nee ds tha t are nec essary for sur vival. These are f ollowed
by basic nee ds for security and sa fety, the nee d to b e loved and to ha ve a sense o f belonging , and the nee d to
have self -worth and c onfidenc e. The top tier o f the p yramid is self -actualiza tion , which is a nee d tha t
essentially e qua tes to achieving one ’s full p otential , and it c an only b e re alized when nee ds lo wer on the
pyramid ha ve been met . To Maslo w and humanis tic theoris ts, self -actualiza tion reflects the humanis tic
emphasis on p ositiv e asp ects o f human na ture . Maslo w sugg ested tha t this is an ong oing , life-long pro cess and
that only a small p ercenta ge of people actually achiev e a self -actualiz ed state (F rancis & K ritsonis , 2006;
Maslo w, 1943).
According to Maslo w (1943), one mus t satisfy lower-lev el nee ds b efore addres sing those nee ds tha t occur
higher in the p yramid . So, for e xample , if someone is s truggling to find enough f ood to meet their nutritional
requirements , it is quite unlik ely tha t the y would sp end an inordina te amount o f time thinking a bout whether
others view ed them as a g ood person or not . Ins tead, all o f their energies w ould b e geared to ward finding
something to e at. Ho wever, it should b e pointe d out tha t Maslo w’s theor y has b een criticiz ed for its subjectiv e
nature and its ina bility to ac count f or phenomena tha t occur in the re al w orld (Leonard , 1982). Other rese arch
has more rec ently addres sed tha t late in lif e, Maslo w prop osed a self -transc endenc e lev el above self -
actualiza tion—to represent s triving f or me aning and purp ose b eyond the c oncerns o f oneself (K oltk o-Riv era,
2006). F or e xample , people sometimes mak e self -sacrific es in order to mak e a p olitic al statement or in an
attempt to impro ve the c onditions o f others . Mohandas K . Gandhi , a w orld-reno wne d adv ocate for
indep endenc e through non violent protes t, on sev eral o ccasions w ent on hung er strikes to protes t a p articular
situa tion . People ma y starve themselv es or other wise put themselv es in dang er displa ying higher -lev el

the regula tion o f hung er, eating , and b ody w eight , and w e will discus s the adv erse c onse quenc es o f disordere d
eating .
Physiological Mechanisms
There are a numb er o f ph ysiologic al mechanisms tha t ser ve as the b asis f or hung er. When our s tomachs are
empty , the y contract . Typic ally, a p erson then e xperienc es hung er p angs . Chemic al mes sages tra vel to the
brain , and ser ve as a signal to initia te feeding b ehavior . When our blo od gluc ose lev els drop , the p ancre as and
liver g enera te a numb er o f chemic al signals tha t induc e hung er (K onturek et al ., 2003; N ovin, Robinson ,
Culbreth , & T ordo ff, 1985) and thus initia te feeding b ehavior .
For mos t people , onc e the y ha ve eaten, the y feelsatiation, or fullnes s and sa tisfaction , and their e ating
behavior s tops . Lik e the initia tion o f eating , satiation is also regula ted by sev eral ph ysiologic al mechanisms . As
blood gluc ose lev els incre ase, the p ancre as and liv er send signals to shut o ff hung er and e ating (Draz en &
Woods, 2003; Dr uce, Small , & Blo om, 2004; Gre ary, 1990). The f ood’s passage through the g astrointes tinal
tract also pro vides imp ortant sa tiety signals to the brain ( Woods, 2004), and fa t cells rele ase lept in, a sa tiety
hormone .
The v arious hung erand sa tiety signals tha t are in volved in the regula tion o f eating are integra ted in the brain .
Research sugg ests tha t sev eral are as o f the h ypothalamus and hindbrain are esp ecially imp ortant sites where
this integra tion o ccurs (A hima & Antwi , 2008; W oods & D ’Alessio, 2008). Ultima tely, activity in the brain
determines whether or not w e eng age in f eeding b ehavior ( Figure 10.9 ).328 10 • Emo tion and Mo tivation

Like food, sex is an imp ortant p art of man y people 's liv es. From an ev olutionar y persp ectiv e, the re ason is
obvious —perpetua tion o f the sp ecies . Sexual b ehavior in humans , however, involves much more than
repro duction . This section pro vides an o verview o f rese arch tha t has b een c onducte d on human se xual
behavior and motiv ation . This section will close with a discus sion o f issues rela ted to g ender identity and
expres sion and se xual orienta tion .
Physiological Mechanisms of Se xual Behavior and Motiv ation
Much o f wha t we kno w about the ph ysiologic al mechanisms tha t underlie se xual b ehavior and motiv ation
comes from animal rese arch . As y ou’ve learne d, the h ypothalamus pla ys an imp ortant role in motiv ated
behaviors , and se x is no e xception . In fact , lesions to an are a of the h ypothalamus c alled the me dial preoptic
area completely disr upt a male ra t’s ability to eng age in se xual b ehavior . Surprisingly , me dial preoptic lesions
do not chang e ho w hard a male ra t is willing to w ork to g ain ac cess to a se xually rec eptiv e female ( Figure
10.14 ). This sugg ests tha t the a bility to eng age in se xual b ehavior and the motiv ation to do so ma y be me diated
by neural s ystems dis tinct from one another .

Animal rese arch sugg ests tha t limbic s ystem s tructures such as the am ygdala and nucleus ac cumb ens are
especially imp ortant f or se xual motiv ation . Dama ge to these are as results in a decre ased motiv ation to eng age
in se xual b ehavior , while le aving the a bility to do so intact ( Figure 10.15 ) (Everet t, 1990). Similar dis sociations
of sexual motiv ation and se xual a bility ha ve also b een obser ved in the f emale ra t (Beck er, Rudick , & J enkins ,
2001; J enkins & Beck er, 2001).334 10 • Emo tion and Mo tivation

FIGURE 10.15 The medial pr eoptic ar ea, an ar ea o f the h ypothalamus , is in volved in the ability t o eng age in se xual
beha vior, but it does not aff ect se xual motiv ation. In c ontr ast, the am ygdala and nucleus ac cumbens ar e involved in
motiv ation f or se xual beha vior, but the y do not aff ect the ability t o eng age in it.
Although human se xual b ehavior is much more c omple x than tha t seen in ra ts, some p arallels b etween
animals and humans c an b e dra wn from this rese arch . The w orldwide p opularity o f drugs use d to tre at erectile
dysfunction (C onrad , 2005) sp eaks to the fact tha t sexual motiv ation and the a bility to eng age in se xual
behavior c an also b e dis sociated in humans . Moreo ver, disorders tha t involve abnormal h ypothalamic function
are o ften as sociated with h ypogonadism (re duced function o f the g onads) and re duced se xual function (e .g.,
Prader -Willi s yndrome). Giv en the h ypothalamus’ s role in endo crine function , it is not surprising tha t
hormones secrete d by the endo crine s ystem also pla y imp ortant roles in se xual motiv ation and b ehavior . For
example , man y animals sho w no sign o f sexual motiv ation in the a bsenc e of the appropria te combina tion o f
sex hormones from their g onads . While this is not the c ase f or humans , there is c onsidera ble evidenc e tha t
sexual motiv ation f or all g enders v aries as a function o f circula ting tes tosterone lev els (Bhasin , Enzlin ,
Coviello , & Bas son, 2007; C arter, 1992; Sher win , 1988).
Kinsey’ s Resear ch
Before the la te 1940s , access to relia ble, empiric ally-based inf orma tion on se x was limite d. Physicians w ere
considere d authorities on all is sues rela ted to se x, despite the fact tha t the y had lit tle to no training in these
issues , and it is lik ely tha t mos t of wha t people knew a bout se x had b een le arne d either through their o wn
experienc es or b y talking with their p eers . Convinc ed tha t people w ould b enefit from a more op en dialogue on
issues rela ted to human se xuality , Dr. AlfredKinse yof Indiana Univ ersity initia ted larg e-scale sur vey rese arch
on the topic ( Figure 10.16 ). The results o f some o f these eff orts w ere publishe d in tw o books—Sexual Beha vior
in the Human Male and Sexual Beha vior in the Human F emale —which w ere publishe d in 1948 and 1953,

At the time , the Kinse y rep orts w ere quite sensa tional . Never b efore had the Americ an public seen its priv ate
sexual b ehavior b ecome the f ocus o f scientific scr utin y on such a larg e sc ale. The b ooks, which w ere fille d with
statistics and scientific ling o, sold remarka bly w ell to the g eneral public , and p eople b egan to eng age in op en
conversa tions a bout human se xuality . As y ou might ima gine , not ev eryone w as happ y tha t this inf orma tion
was b eing publishe d. In fact , these b ooks w ere b anne d in some c ountries . Ultima tely, the c ontro versy resulte d
in Kinse y losing funding tha t he had secure d from the R ockefeller F ounda tion to c ontinue his rese arch eff orts
(Bancro ft, 2004).
Although Kinse y’s rese arch has b een widely criticiz ed as b eing riddle d with sampling and s tatistical errors
(Jenkins , 2010), there is lit tle doubt tha t this rese arch w as v ery influential in shaping future rese arch on
human se xual b ehavior and motiv ation . Kinse y describ ed a remarka bly div erse rang e of sexual b ehaviors and

Masters and Johnson’ s Resear ch
In 1966, W illiam Mas ters and V irginia Johnson publishe d a b ook detailing the results o f their obser vations o f
nearly 700 p eople who a gree d to p articip ate in their s tudy o f ph ysiologic al resp onses during se xual b ehavior .
Unlik e Kinse y, who use d personal inter view s and sur veys to c ollect da ta, Mas ters and J ohnson obser ved
people ha ving interc ourse in a v ariety o f positions , and the y obser ved people mas turb ating , manually or with
the aid o f a devic e. While this w as o ccurring , rese archers rec orde d me asurements o f ph ysiologic al varia bles ,
such as blo od pres sure and respira tion ra te, as w ell as me asurements o f sexual arousal , such as v aginal
lubric ation and p enile tumesc ence (swelling as sociated with an erection). In total , Mas ters and J ohnson
obser ved ne arly 10,000 se xual acts as a p art of their rese arch (Ho ck, 2008).
Base d on these obser vations , Mas ters and J ohnson divide d the sexual resp onse cy cleinto f our phases tha t are
fairly similar in men and w omen: e xcitement , pla teau, org asm , and resolution ( Figure 10.17 ). The excitement
phase is the arousal phase o f the se xual resp onse cy cle, and it is mark ed by erection o f the p enis or clitoris and
lubric ation and e xpansion o f the v aginal c anal . During plate au, the v agina s wells fur ther and blo od flo w to the
labia minora incre ases , and the p enis b ecomes fully erect and ma y exhibit pre -ejacula tory fluid . People
experienc e incre ases in muscle tone during this time .Orgasm is mark ed in f emales b y rh ythmic c ontractions

In addition to the insights tha t their rese arch pro vide d with reg ards to the se xual resp onse cy cle and the multi-
orgasmic p otential o f females , Mas ters and J ohnson also c ollecte d imp ortant inf orma tion a bout repro ductiv e

erect p enis and its a bility to pro vide se xual ple asure to a p artner . Furthermore , the y determine d tha t the
vagina is a v ery elas tic s tructure tha t can c onform to p enises o f various siz es (Ho ck, 2008). In a similar manner
to Kinse y’s work and other s tudies , Mas ters and J ohnson ’s rese arch has b een criticiz ed, built on , and in some
cases pro ven wrong . The rese arch represents an imp ortant element o f the his tory of sexual rese arch , and is
not view ed as entirely ac cura te to day.
Sexual Orientation
As mentione d earlier , a p erson ’s sexual orienta tion is their emotional , romantic , and erotic a ttraction to ward
other p eople or no p eople . While the majority o f people identif y as heterose xual , there is a siza ble p opula tion
of people within the Unite d Sta tes who identif y as lesbian , gay, bise xual , panse xual , ase xual , or other non-
hetero se xualities . Bise xual p eople are a ttracte d to p eople o f their o wn g ender and another g ender; p anse xual
people e xperienc e attraction without reg ard to se x, gender identity or g ender e xpres sion; ase xual p eople do
not e xperienc e se xual a ttraction or ha ve little or no interes t in se xual activity . Queer is an umbrella term use d
to describ e se xual orienta tion , gender identity , or g ender e xpres sion . Other descriptiv e terms ma y not ref er to
a se xual a ttraction , but ra ther a romantic one . For e xample , an aromantic p erson do es not e xperienc e
romantic a ttraction; this is diff erent from ase xuality , which ref ers to a lack o f sexual a ttraction . And some
sexual orienta tions do not ref er to g ender in their description (PFL AG, 2021). It is imp ortant to ackno wledge
and unders tand tha t man y of these orienta tions e xist on on a sp ectr um, and there ma y be no sp ecific term to
describ e ho w an individual f eels .
Some o f these terms ha ve been as sociated in a bbrevia tions such as L GBTQ (lesbian , gay, bise xual , trans gender ,
and queer or ques tioning ). In some c ases , people and org aniza tions ma y add "I" to represent interse x people
(describ ed below), and " A" for ase xual or aromantic p eople (or sometimes f or "allies "), as w ell as one "P " to
describ e panse xual p eople and sometimes another "P " to describ e polysexual p eople . Finally , some p eople and
organiza tions add a plus sign (+) to represent other p ossible identities or orienta tions . Sexuality and g ender
terminolog y are c onstantly changing , and ma y me an diff erent things to diff erent p eople; the y are not
univ ersal , and e ach individual defines them f or themselv es (UC Da vis L GBTQIA R esourc e Center 2020).10.3 • Se xual Beha vior 337

Gender Identity
Man y people c onfla te se xual orienta tion with g ender identity b ecause o f misc onceptions and a ttitudes tha t
exist about se xuality . In re ality , these are tw o rela ted, but diff erent , asp ects o f who w e are .Gender ident ity
refers to one ’s sense o f being male , female , neither o f these , both o f these , or another g ender . Generally , our
gender identities c orresp ond to our chromosomal and phenotypic se x, but this is not alw ays the c ase.
Trans gender p eople ’s gender identity diff ers from the se x the y were as signe d at bir th. Trans gender p eople
may use a rang e of terms to describ e themselv es, including a bbrevia tions (e .g. trans) or terms such as non-
binar y.
When individuals do not f eel c omf ortable identif ying with the g ender as sociated with their biologic al se x, then
they ma y experienc e gender dy sphoria. Gender dy sphoria is a dia gnos tic c ategory in the fifth e dition o f the
Diagnos tic and Sta tistical Manual o f Mental Disorders (DSM-5) tha t describ es individuals who do not identif y
as the g ender tha t mos t people w ould as sume the y are . This dy sphoria mus t persis t for a t least six months and
result in signific ant dis tres s or dy sfunction to meet DSM-5 dia gnos tic criteria. In order f or children to b e
assigne d this dia gnos tic c ategory, the y mus t verbalize their desire to b ecome the other g ender . It is imp ortant
to note tha t not all trans gender p eople e xperienc e gender dy sphoria, and tha t its dia gnos tic c ategoriza tion is
not univ ersally ac cepte d. For e xample , in 2019, the W orld He alth Org aniza tion reclas sifie d “gender identity
disorder ” as “ gender inc ongr uenc e,” and c ategoriz ed it under se xual he alth ra ther than a mental disorder .
However, health and mental he alth pro fessionals indic ate tha t the presenc e of the dia gnos tic c ategory do es
assist in supp orting those who nee d tre atment or help .
Some trans gender individuals ma y under take a pro cess of transition , in which the y mo ve from living in a w ay
that is more aligne d with the se x as signe d at bir th to living in a w ay tha t is aligne d with their g ender identity .
Transitioning ma y tak e the f orm o f social, leg al, or me dical asp ects o f someone 's lif e, but not ev eryone
under takes an y or all typ es o f transition . Social transition ma y involve the p erson 's presenta tion , name ,
pronouns , and rela tionships . Leg al transition c an include changing their g ender on g overnment or other
official do cuments , changing their leg al name , and so on . Some p eople ma y underg o a ph ysical or me dical
transition , in which the y chang e their outw ard, physical, or se xual characteris tics in order f or their ph ysical
being to b etter align with their g ender identity (UCSF T rans gender C are 2019). N ot all trans gender individuals
choose to alter their b odies: man y will maintain their original ana tom y but ma y present themselv es to so ciety
as another g ender . This is typic ally done b y adopting the dres s, hairs tyle, mannerisms , or other characteris tics
typic ally as signe d to another g ender . It is imp ortant to note tha t people who cros s-dres s, or w ear clothing tha t
is traditionally as signe d to a g ender diff erent from their biologic al se x, are not nec essarily trans gender . Cross-
dres sing is typic ally a f orm o f self -expres sion or p ersonal s tyle, and it do es not indic ate a p erson 's gender
identity or tha t the y are trans gender ( TSER 2021).
Interse x is a g eneral term use d to describ e people whose se x traits , repro ductiv e ana tom y, hormones , or
chromosomes are diff erent from the usual tw o ways human b odies dev elop . Some interse x traits are
recogniz ed at bir th, while others are not rec ogniza ble until pub erty or la ter in lif e (inter ACT 2021). Interse x
10.3 • Se xual Beha vior 339
and trans gender are not interchang eable terms; man y trans gender p eople ha ve no interse x traits , and man y
interse x people do not c onsider themselv es trans gender .
Those who identif y with the se x the y were as signe d at bir th are o ften ref erre d to as cisgender , utilizing the
Latin prefix " cis," which me ans " on the same side ." (The prefix "trans " me ans "acros s.") Man y cis gender p eople
do not self -identif y as such . As with trans gender p eople , the term or usa ge of cis gender do es not indic ate a
person 's se xual orienta tion , gender , or g ender e xpres sion ( TSER 2021).
Our scientific kno wledge and g eneral unders tanding a bout g ender identity c ontinue to ev olve, and y oung
people to day ha ve more opp ortunity to e xplore and op enly e xpres s diff erent ide as a bout wha t gender me ans
than previous g enera tions . Recent s tudies indic ate tha t the majority o f millennials (those a ges 18–34) reg ard
gender as a sp ectr um ins tead o f a s trict male/f emale binar y, and tha t 12% identif y as trans gender or g ender
non-c onforming . Additionally , more p eople kno w others who use g ender -neutral pronouns (such as the y/
them) (K enne dy, 2017). This chang e in langua ge ma y indic ate tha t millennials and Genera tion Z p eople
unders tand the e xperienc e of gender itself diff erently . As y oung p eople le ad this chang e, other chang es are
emerging in a rang e of spheres , from public b athro om p olicies to retail org aniza tions . For e xample , some
retailers are s tarting to chang e traditional g ender -based mark eting o f pro ducts , such as remo ving “pink and
blue ” clothing and to y aisles . Even with these chang es, those who e xist outside o f traditional g ender norms fac e
difficult challeng es. Even p eople who v ary slightly from traditional norms are o ften the targ et of discrimina tion
and violenc e.

Issues rela ted to se xual orienta tion and g ender identity are v ery much influenc ed by so ciocultural factors .
Even the w ays in which w e define se xual orienta tion and g ender v ary from one culture to the ne xt. While in the
Unite d Sta tes heterose xuality has his toric ally b een view ed as the norm (making it a heteronorma tive so ciety ),
there are so cieties tha t ha ve diff erent a ttitudes reg arding L GBTQ people . In fact , in some ins tanc es, perio ds o f

exclusiv ely same -sex se xual b ehavior are so cially prescrib ed as a p art of normal dev elopment and ma tura tion .
For e xample , in p arts of New Guine a, young b oys are e xpecte d to eng age in se xual b ehavior with other b oys for
a giv en p erio d of time b ecause it is b eliev ed tha t doing so is nec essary for these b oys to b ecome men (Baldwin

There has his toric ally b een a tw o-gendere d culture in the Unite d Sta tes. We ha ve tende d to clas sify an
individual as either male or f emale ac cording to the se x the y were as signe d at bir th, leading the Unite d Sta tes

resulting in more than tw o gender c ategories . For e xample , in Thailand , you c an b e male , female , or ka thoey. A

The Case of David R eimer
In Aug ust of 1965, Janet and R onald R eimer o f Winnipeg , Canada , welcomed the bir th of their twin sons , Bruc e
and Brian. Within a f ew months , the twins w ere experiencing urinar y problems; doct ors r ecommended the
problems c ould be al leviated b y ha ving the bo ys cir cumcised. A malfunction o f the medical equipment used t o
perform the cir cumcision r esul ted in Bruc e’s penis being irr epar ably damag ed. Dis traught, Janet and R onald
look ed to exper t advic e on what t o do with their bab y bo y. By happens tanc e, the c ouple became a ware of Dr.
John Mone y at Johns Hopkins Univ ersity and his theor y of psychose xual neutr ality (Colapint o, 2000).
Dr. Mone y had spent a c onsider able amount o f time r esear ching tr ansgender individuals and individuals born
with ambig uous g enitalia . As a r esul t of this w ork, he de veloped a theor y of psychose xual neutr ality . His theor y
asserted that w e are es sential ly neutr al at bir th with r egard to our g ender identity and that w e don ’t as sume a
concr ete gender identity until w e begin t o mas ter lang uage. Furthermor e, Dr. Mone y belie ved that the w ay in
which w e are socializ ed in earl y life is ul timat ely much mor e impor tant than our biolog y in det ermining our
gender identity (Mone y, 1962).
Dr. Mone y enc ouraged Janet and R onald t o bring the twins t o Johns Hopkins Univ ersity , and he c onvinc ed them
that the y should r aise Bruc e as a girl . Left with f ew other op tions at the time , Janet and R onald agr eed t o ha ve
Bruc e’s testicles r emo ved and t o raise him as a girl . When the y returned home t o Canada , the y brought with them
Brian and his “ sister,” Brenda , along with specific ins tructions t o ne ver reveal t o Br enda that she had been born a
boy (Colapint o, 2000).
Early on, Dr . Mone y shar ed with the scientific c ommunity the gr eat suc cess of this natur al experiment that
seemed t o ful ly suppor t his theor y of psychose xual neutr ality (Mone y, 1975). Indeed, in earl y int erviews with the
childr en it appear ed that Br enda w as a typical lit tle girl who lik ed to pla y with “ girly” toys and do “ girly” things .
However, Dr. Mone y was les s than f orthcoming with inf ormation that seemed t o argue ag ains t the suc cess of the
case . In r eality , Brenda’ s par ents w ere constantl y concerned that their lit tle girl w asn’t really beha ving as mos t
girls did, and b y the time Br enda w as nearing adolesc ence, it w as painful ly ob vious t o the famil y that she w as
really ha ving a har d time identif ying as a f emale . In addition, Br enda w as bec oming incr easingl y reluctant t o
continue her visits with Dr . Mone y to the point that she thr eatened suicide if her par ents made her g o back t o see
him ag ain.
At that point, Janet and R onald disclosed the true natur e of Brenda’ s earl y childhood t o their daught er. While
initial ly shock ed, Br enda r epor ted that things made sense t o her no w, and ul timat ely, by the time she w as an
adolesc ent, Br enda had decided t o identif y as a male . Thus , she became Da vid R eimer .
David w as quit e comfortable in his masculine r ole. He made ne w friends and beg an to think about his futur e.
Although his cas tration had left him inf ertile, he s till wanted to be a father . In 1990, Da vid married a singleDIG DEEPER10.3 • Se xual Beha vior 341
mother and lo ved his ne w role as a husband and father . In 1997, Da vid w as made a ware that Dr . Mone y was
continuing t o publiciz e his case as a suc cess suppor ting his theor y of psychose xual neutr ality . This pr omp ted
David and his br other t o go public with their e xperienc es in at temp t to discr edit the doct or’s publications . While
this r evelation cr eated a fir estorm in the scientific c ommunity f or Dr . Mone y, it also trig gered a series o f
unfortunat e events that ul timat ely led t o Da vid dying b y suicide in 2004 (O ’Connel l, 2004).
This sad s tory speak s to the c omple xities in volved in g ender identity . While the R eimer case had earlier been
paraded as a hal lmark o f how socialization trumped biolog y in t erms o f gender identity , the truth o f the s tory

10.4 Emotion
LEARNING OBJEC TIVES
By the end o f this section, y ou wil l be able t o:
•Explain the major theories o f emotion
•Describe the r ole that limbic s tructur es pla y in emotional pr ocessing
•Unders tand the ubiquit ous natur e of producing and r ecognizing emotional e xpression
As w e mo ve through our daily liv es, we experienc e a v ariety o f emotions . An emot ion is a subjectiv e state of
being tha t we often describ e as our f eelings . Emotions result from the c ombina tion o f subjectiv e experienc e,
expres sion , cognitiv e appraisal , and ph ysiologic al resp onses (Lev enson , Carstensen , Friesen , & Ekman , 1991).
However, as discus sed later in the chapter , the e xact order in which the c omp onents o ccur is not cle ar, and
some p arts ma y happ en a t the same time . An emotion o ften b egins with a subjectiv e (individual) e xperienc e,
which is a s timulus . Often the s timulus is e xternal , but it do es not ha ve to b e from the outside w orld . For
example , it might b e tha t one thinks a bout w ar and b ecomes sad , even though the y nev er experienc ed war.
Emotional e xpres sion ref ers to the w ay one displa ys an emotion and includes non verbal and v erbal behaviors
(Gros s, 1999). One also p erforms a c ognitiv e appraisal in which a p erson tries to determine the w ay the y will b e
imp acte d by a situa tion (R oseman & Smith , 2001). In addition , emotions include ph ysiologic al resp onses , such
as p ossible chang es in he art rate, sweating , etc . (Sous signan , 2002).
The w ords emotion and mo od are sometimes use d interchang eably, but ps ychologis ts use these w ords to ref er
to tw o diff erent things . Typic ally, the w ord emotion indic ates a subjectiv e, affectiv e state tha t is rela tively
intense and tha t occurs in resp onse to something w e experienc e (Figure 10.20 ). Emotions are o ften thought to
be consciously e xperienc ed and intentional .Mood, on the other hand , ref ers to a prolong ed, les s intense ,
affectiv e state tha t do es not o ccur in resp onse to something w e experienc e. Mo od states ma y not b e
consciously rec ogniz ed and do not c arry the intentionality tha t is as sociated with emotion (Bee die, Terry, Lane ,
& Dev onp ort, 2011). Here w e will f ocus on emotion , and y ou will le arn more a bout mo od in the chapter tha t

We can b e at the heights o f joy or in the depths o f desp air. We might f eel angr y when w e are b etra yed, fear
when w e are thre atene d, and surprise d when something une xpecte d happ ens. This section will outline some
of the mos t well-kno wn theories e xplaining our emotional e xperienc e and pro vide insight into the biologic al
bases o f emotion . This section closes with a discus sion o f the ubiquitous na ture o f facial e xpres sions o f
emotion and our a bilities to rec ogniz e those e xpres sions in others .
Theories of Emotion
Our emotional s tates are c ombina tions o f ph ysiologic al arousal , psychologic al appraisal , and subjectiv e
experienc es. Together , these are the comp onents of emot ion, and our e xperienc es, backgrounds , and cultures
inform our emotions . Theref ore, diff erent p eople ma y ha ve diff erent emotional e xperienc es ev en when fac ed
with similar circums tanc es. Over time , sev eral diff erent theories o f emotion , sho wn in Figure 10.21 , have been
prop osed to e xplain ho w the v arious c omp onents o f emotion interact with one another .10.4 • Emo tion 343
FIGURE 10.21 This fig ure illustrates the major as sertions o f the James -Lange, Cannon-Bar d, and Schacht er-Sing er
two-fact or theories o f emotion. (cr edit "snak e": modification o f work b y "tableatn y"/Flickr; cr edit "fac e":

The James -Lang e theor yof emotion as serts tha t emotions arise from ph ysiologic al arousal . Recall wha t you
have learne d about the s ymp athetic ner vous s ystem and our fight or flight resp onse when thre atene d. If y ou
were to enc ounter some thre at in y our en vironment , like a v enomous snak e in y our b acky ard, your
symp athetic ner vous s ystem w ould initia te signific ant ph ysiologic al arousal , which w ould mak e your he art
race and incre ase y our respira tion ra te. According to the J ames -Lang e theor y of emotion , you w ould only
experienc e a f eeling o f fear a fter this ph ysiologic al arousal had tak en plac e. Furthermore , diff erent arousal
patterns w ould b e as sociated with diff erent f eelings .
Other theoris ts, however, doubte d tha t the ph ysiologic al arousal tha t occurs with diff erent typ es o f emotions is344 10 • Emo tion and Mo tivation
Access for fr ee a t opens tax. org
distinct enough to result in the wide v ariety o f emotions tha t we experienc e. Thus , the Cannon-Bard theor yof
emotion w as dev elop ed. According to this view , physiologic al arousal and emotional e xperienc e occur
simultaneously , yet indep endently (Lang , 1994). So , when y ou see the v enomous snak e, you f eel f ear a t exactly
the same time tha t your b ody mounts its fight or flight resp onse . This emotional re action w ould b e sep arate
and indep endent o f the ph ysiologic al arousal , even though the y co-occur.
Does smiling mak e you happ y? A lterna tively, does b eing happ y mak e you smile? The facial f eedback
hypothesis prop oses tha t your facial e xpres sion c an actually a ffect y our emotional e xperienc e (A delman &
Zajonc , 1989; Boig er & Mesquita, 2012; B uck, 1980; C apella, 1993; Sous signan , 2001). R esearch in vestigating
the facial f eedback h ypothesis sugg ested tha t suppres sion o f facial e xpres sion o f emotion lo wered the
intensity o f some emotions e xperienc ed by particip ants (Da vis, Senghas , & Ochsner , 2009). Ha vas, Glenb erg,
Guto wski, Lucarelli , and Da vidson (2010) use d Boto x injections to p aralyz e facial muscles and limit facial
expres sions , including fro wning , and the y found tha t depres sed people rep orted les s depres sion a fter their
frowning muscles w ere p aralyz ed. Other rese arch f ound tha t the intensities o f facial e xpres sions a ffecte d the
emotional re actions (Sous signan , 2002). In other w ords , if something insignific ant o ccurs and y ou smile as if
you jus t won lot tery, you will actually b e happier a bout the lit tle thing than y ou w ould b e if y ou only had a tin y
smile . Conversely , if y ou w alk around fro wning all the time , it might c ause y ou to ha ve les s positiv e emotions
than y ou w ould if y ou had smile d. Interes tingly , Sous signan (2002) also rep orted ph ysiologic al arousal
differenc es as sociated with the intensities o f one typ e of smile .
G. Marañon P osadillo w as a S panish ph ysician who s tudie d the ps ychologic al eff ects o f adrenaline to cre ate a
model f or the e xperienc e of emotion . Marañon 's mo del prec eded Schachter 's tw o-factor or arousal-c ognition
theor y of emotion (C ornelius , 1991). The Schachter -Sing er two-factor theor yof emotion is another v aria tion
on theories o f emotions tha t tak es into ac count b oth ph ysiologic al arousal and the emotional e xperienc e.
According to this theor y, emotions are c omp osed of two factors: ph ysiologic al and c ognitiv e. In other w ords ,
physiologic al arousal is interprete d in c onte xt to pro duce the emotional e xperienc e. In revisiting our e xample
involving the v enomous snak e in y our b acky ard, the tw o-factor theor y maintains tha t the snak e elicits
symp athetic ner vous s ystem activ ation tha t is la beled as f ear giv en the c onte xt, and our e xperienc e is tha t of
fear. If y ou had la beled your s ymp athetic ner vous s ystem activ ation as jo y, you w ould ha ve experienc ed joy.
The Schachter -Sing er tw o-factor theor y dep ends on la beling the ph ysiologic al experienc e, which is a typ e of
cognitiv e appraisal .
Magda Arnold w as the firs t theoris t to o ffer an e xplora tion o f the me aning o f appraisal , and to present an
outline o f wha t the appraisal pro cess might b e and ho w it rela tes to emotion (R oseman & Smith , 2001). The k ey
idea of appraisal theor y is tha t you ha ve thoughts (a c ognitiv e appraisal) b efore y ou e xperienc e an emotion ,
and the emotion y ou e xperienc e dep ends on the thoughts y ou had (F rijda, 1988; Lazar us, 1991). If y ou think
something is p ositiv e, you will ha ve more p ositiv e emotions a bout it than if y our appraisal w as neg ative, and
the opp osite is tr ue. Appraisal theor y explains the w ay tw o people c an ha ve tw o completely diff erent emotions
regarding the same ev ent. For e xample , supp ose y our ps ycholog y ins tructor selecte d you to lecture on
emotion; y ou might see tha t as p ositiv e, because it represents an opp ortunity to b e the c enter o f attention , and
you w ould e xperienc e happines s. Ho wever, if y ou dislik e sp eaking in public , you c ould ha ve a neg ative
appraisal and e xperienc e disc omf ort.
Schachter and Sing er b eliev ed tha t ph ysiologic al arousal is v ery similar acros s the diff erent typ es o f emotions
that we experienc e, and theref ore, the c ognitiv e appraisal o f the situa tion is critic al to the actual emotion

someone else the y thought w as another subject in the rese arch project . In re ality , the other p erson w as a
confedera te (someone w orking on b ehalf o f) of the rese archer . The c onfedera te eng aged in scripte d displa ys of
euphoric or angr y behavior (Schachter & Sing er, 1962).
When those p articip ants who w ere told tha t the y should e xpect to f eel s ymptoms o f ph ysiologic al arousal w ere
asked about an y emotional chang es tha t the y had e xperienc ed rela ted to either euphoria or ang er (dep ending

physiologic al arousal as a function o f the injection w ere more lik ely to rep ort tha t the y experienc ed euphoria

epinephrine e xperienc ed the same ph ysiologic al arousal , only those who w ere not e xpecting the arousal use d
conte xt to interpret the arousal as a chang e in emotional s tate (Schachter & Sing er, 1962).
Strong emotional resp onses are as sociated with s trong ph ysiologic al arousal , which c aused some theoris ts to
sugg est tha t the signs o f ph ysiologic al arousal , including incre ased he art rate, respira tion ra te, and s weating ,

The rela tionship b etween our e xperiencing o f emotions and our c ognitiv e pro cessing o f them , and the order in
which these o ccur, remains a topic o f rese arch and deb ate. Lazar us (1991) dev elop ed the cognit ive-
mediat ional theor ythat asserts our emotions are determine d by our appraisal o f the s timulus . This appraisal
mediates b etween the s timulus and the emotional resp onse , and it is imme diate and o ften unc onscious . In
contras t to the Schachter -Sing er mo del, the appraisal prec edes a c ognitiv e label. You will le arn more a bout
Lazar us’s appraisal c oncept when y ou s tudy s tres s, health , and lif estyle. Ho wever, there are other view s of
emotions tha t also emphasiz e the c ognitiv e pro cesses.
Return to the e xample o f being ask ed to lecture b y your pro fessor. Even if y ou do not enjo y sp eaking in public ,
you prob ably c ould mana ge to do it . You w ould purp osefully c ontrol y our emotions , which w ould allo w you to
speak, but w e constantly regula te our emotions , and much o f our emotion regula tion o ccurs without us
activ ely thinking a bout it . Ma uss and her c olleagues s tudie d automa tic emotion regula tion (AER), which ref ers
to the non-delib erate control o f emotions . It is simply not re acting with y our emotions , and AER c an a ffect all
aspects o f emotional pro cesses. AER c an influenc e the things y ou a ttend to , your appraisal , your choic e to
engage in an emotional e xperienc e, and y our b ehaviors a fter an emotion is e xperienc ed (Ma uss, Bung e, &
Gros s, 2007; Ma uss, Lev enson , McC arter, Wilhelm , & Gros s, 2005). AER is similar to other a utoma tic c ognitiv e
processes in which sensa tions activ ate kno wledge structures tha t affect functioning . These kno wledge
structures c an include c oncepts , schemas , or scripts .
The ide a of AER is tha t people dev elop an a utoma tic pro cess tha t works lik e a script or schema, and the
process do es not re quire delib erate thought to regula te emotions . AER w orks lik e riding a bicy cle. Onc e you
develop the pro cess, you jus t do it without thinking a bout it . AER c an b e adaptiv e or maladaptiv e and has
imp ortant he alth implic ations (Hopp , Troy, & Ma uss, 2011). A daptiv e AER le ads to b etter he alth outc omes than
maladaptiv e AER , primarily due to e xperiencing or mitig ating s tres sors b etter than p eople with maladaptiv e
AERs (Hopp , Troy, & Ma uss, 2011). A lterna tively, maladaptiv e AERs ma y be critic al for maintaining some
psychologic al disorders (Hopp , Troy, & Ma uss, 2011). Ma uss and her c olleagues f ound tha t strategies c ould
reduce neg ative emotions , which in turn should incre ase ps ychologic al he alth (Ma uss, Cook, Cheng , & Gros s,

useful (Ma uss, et al ., 2005; Ma uss & R obinson , 2009). Ho wever, another w ay of considering emotions
challeng es our entire unders tanding o f emotions .
After a bout three dec ades o f interdisciplinar y rese arch , Barret t argue d tha t we do not unders tand emotions .
She prop osed tha t emotions w ere not built into y our brain a t bir th, but ra ther the y were c onstructe d based on
your e xperienc es. Emotions in the c onstructivis t theor y are pre dictions tha t construct y our e xperienc e of the
world . In chapter 7 y ou le arne d tha t concepts are c ategories or groupings o f linguis tic inf orma tion , ima ges,
ideas, or memories , such as lif e experienc es. Barret t extende d tha t to include emotions as c oncepts tha t are
predictions (Barret t, 2017). Tw o identic al ph ysiologic al states c an result in diff erent emotional s tates
dep ending on y our pre dictions . For e xample , your brain pre dicting a churning s tomach in a b akery could le ad
to you c onstructing hung er. Ho wever, your brain pre dicting a churning s tomach while y ou w ere w aiting f or
medical tes t results c ould le ad y our brain to c onstruct w orry. Thus , you c an c onstruct tw o diff erent emotions
from the same ph ysiologic al sensa tions . Rather than emotions b eing something o ver which y ou ha ve no
control , you c an c ontrol and influenc e your emotions .

Two other prominent view s arise from the w ork o f Robert Zajonc and J oseph LeDoux . Zajonc as serted tha t
some emotions o ccur sep arately from or prior to our c ognitiv e interpreta tion o f them , such as f eeling f ear in
resp onse to an une xpecte d loud sound (Zajonc , 1998). He also b eliev ed in wha t we might c asually ref er to as a
gut f eeling—tha t we can e xperienc e an ins tantaneous and une xplaina ble lik e or dislik e for someone or
something (Zajonc , 1980). LeDoux also view s some emotions as re quiring no c ognition: some emotions
completely b ypass conte xtual interpreta tion . His rese arch into the neuroscienc e of emotion has demons trated
the am ygdala ’s primar y role in f ear (Cunha, Monfils , & LeDoux , 2010; LeDoux 1996, 2002). A f ear stimulus is
processed by the brain through one o f two paths: from the thalamus ( where it is p erceived) directly to the
amygdala or from the thalamus through the c ortex and then to the am ygdala. The firs t path is quick , while the
second ena bles more pro cessing a bout details o f the s timulus . In the f ollowing section , we will lo ok more
closely a t the neuroscienc e of emotional resp onse .
The Biology of Emotions
Earlier , you le arne d about the limbic s ystem , which is the are a of the brain in volved in emotion and memor y
(Figure 10.22 ). The limbic s ystem includes the h ypothalamus , thalamus , am ygdala, and the hipp ocampus . The
hypothalamus pla ys a role in the activ ation o f the s ymp athetic ner vous s ystem tha t is a p art of an y giv en
emotional re action . The thalamus ser ves as a sensor y rela y center whose neurons project to b oth the am ygdala
and the higher c ortical regions f or fur ther pro cessing . The am ygdala pla ys a role in pro cessing emotional
informa tion and sending tha t inf orma tion on (F ossati, 2012). The hipp ocampus integra tes emotional
experienc e with c ognition (F emenía, Góme z-Galán , Lindsk og, & Ma gara, 2012).

Amygdala
The amygdala has rec eived a gre at deal of attention from rese archers interes ted in unders tanding the
biologic al basis f or emotions , esp ecially f ear and anxiety (Blackf ord & Pine , 2012; Go osens & Maren , 2002;
Maren , Phan , & Lib erzon, 2013). The am ygdala is c omp osed of various subnuclei , including the b asola teral
comple x and the c entral nucleus ( Figure 10.23 ). The basolateral c omple xhas dense c onnections with a
variety o f sensor y are as o f the brain . It is critic al for clas sical conditioning and f or a ttaching emotional v alue to
learning pro cesses and memor y. The central nucleus plays a role in a ttention , and it has c onnections with the
hypothalamus and v arious brains tem are as to regula te the a utonomic ner vous and endo crine s ystems’ activity
(Pessoa, 2010).

FIGURE 10.23 The anat omy of the basolat eral comple x and c entr al nucleus o f the am ygdala ar e illustrated in this
diagr am.
Animal rese arch has demons trated tha t there is incre ased activ ation o f the am ygdala in ra t pups tha t ha ve
odor cues p aire d with electric al sho ck when their mother is a bsent . This le ads to an a version to the o dor cue
that sugg ests the ra ts le arne d to f ear the o dor cue . Interes tingly , when the mother w as present , the ra ts actually
showed a pref erenc e for the o dor cue despite its as sociation with an electric al sho ck. This pref erenc e was
associated with no incre ases in am ygdala activ ation . This sugg ests a diff erential eff ect on the am ygdala b y the
conte xt(the presenc e or a bsenc e of the mother) determine d whether the pups le arne d to f ear the o dor or to b e
attracte d to it (Moric eau & Sulliv an, 2006).
Raineki , Cortés, Belnoue , and Sulliv an (2012) demons trated tha t, in ra ts, neg ative early lif e experienc es c ould
alter the function o f the am ygdala and result in adolesc ent p atterns o f behavior tha t mimic human mo od
disorders . In this s tudy , rat pups rec eived either a busiv e or normal tre atment during p ostnatal da ys 8–12.
There w ere tw o forms o f abusiv e tre atment . The firs t form o f abusiv e tre atment had an insufficient b edding
condition . The mother ra t had insufficient b edding ma terial in her c age to build a prop er nes t tha t resulte d in
her sp ending more time a way from her pups tr ying to c onstruct a nes t and les s times nursing her pups . The
second f orm o f abusiv e tre atment had an as sociative learning task tha t involved pairing o dors and an electric al
stimulus in the a bsenc e of the mother , as describ ed above. The c ontrol group w as in a c age with sufficient
bedding and w as left undis turb ed with their mothers during the same time p erio d. The ra t pups tha t
experienc ed abuse w ere much more lik ely to e xhibit depres sive-like symptoms during adolesc ence when
comp ared to c ontrols . These depres sive-like behaviors w ere as sociated with incre ased activ ation o f the
amygdala.
Human rese arch also sugg ests a rela tionship b etween the am ygdala and ps ychologic al disorders o f mo od or
anxiety . Chang es in am ygdala s tructure and function ha ve been demons trated in adolesc ents who are either
at-risk or ha ve been dia gnose d with v arious mo od and/or anxiety disorders (Miguel-Hidalg o, 2013; Qin et al .,
2013). It has also b een sugg ested tha t functional diff erenc es in the am ygdala c ould ser ve as a biomark er to
differentia te individuals suff ering from bip olar disorder from those suff ering from major depres sive disorder
(Fournier , Keener , Almeida, K ronha us, & Phillips , 2013).
Hippocampus
As mentione d earlier , the hipp ocampus is also in volved in emotional pro cessing . Lik e the am ygdala, rese arch10.4 • Emo tion 349
has demons trated tha t hipp ocamp al structure and function are link ed to a v ariety o f mo od and anxiety
disorders . Individuals suff ering from p osttrauma tic s tres s disorder (PT SD) sho w mark ed re ductions in the
volume o f sev eral p arts of the hipp ocampus , which ma y result from decre ased lev els o f neurog enesis and
dendritic branching (the g enera tion o f new neurons and the g enera tion o f new dendrites in e xisting neurons ,
resp ectiv ely) (Wang et al ., 2010). While it is imp ossible to mak e a c ausal claim with c orrela tional rese arch lik e
this , studies ha ve demons trated behavioral impro vements and hipp ocamp al volume incre ases f ollowing either
pharmac ologic al or c ognitiv e-behavioral therap y in individuals suff ering from PT SD (Bremner & V ermet ten,
2004; Lev y-Gigi , Szabó, Kelemen , & K éri, 2013).
Facial Expr ession and R ecognition of Emotions
Culture c an imp act the w ay in which p eople displa y emotion . Acultural displa y rule is one o f a c ollection o f
culturally sp ecific s tandards tha t govern the typ es and fre quencies o f displa ys of emotions tha t are ac cepta ble
(Mala testa & Ha viland , 1982). Theref ore, people from v arying cultural b ackgrounds c an ha ve very diff erent
cultural displa y rules o f emotion . For e xample , rese arch has sho wn tha t individuals from the Unite d Sta tes
expres s neg ative emotions lik e fear, ang er, and dis gust both alone and in the presenc e of others , while
Japanese individuals only do so while alone (Ma tsumoto , 1990). F urthermore , individuals from cultures tha t
tend to emphasiz e so cial c ohesion are more lik ely to eng age in suppres sion o f emotional re action so the y can
evalua te which resp onse is mos t appropria te in a giv en c onte xt (Ma tsumoto , Yoo, & N akagawa, 2008).
Other dis tinct cultural characteris tics might b e involved in emotionality . For ins tanc e, there ma y be gender
differenc es in volved in emotional pro cessing . While rese arch into g ender diff erenc es in emotional displa y is
equiv ocal, there is some evidenc e tha t people o f diff erent g enders ma y diff er in regula tion o f emotions (McRae ,
Ochsner , Ma uss, Gabrieli , & Gros s, 2008).
Paul Ekman (1972) rese arche d a N ew Guine a man who w as living in a prelitera te culture using s tone
implements , and which w as isola ted and had nev er seen an y outsiders b efore. Ekman ask ed the man to sho w
wha t his facial e xpres sion w ould b e if: (1) friends visite d, (2) his child had jus t die d, (3) he w as a bout to fight ,
(4) he s tepp ed on a smelly de ad pig . After Ekman ’s return from N ew Guine a, he rese arche d facial e xpres sions
for more than f our dec ades . Despite diff erent emotional displa y rules , our a bility to rec ogniz e and pro duce
facial e xpres sions o f emotion app ears to b e univ ersal . In fact , even c ong enitally blind individuals pro duce the
same facial e xpres sion o f emotions , despite their nev er ha ving the opp ortunity to obser ve these facial displa ys
of emotion in other p eople . This w ould seem to sugg est tha t the p attern o f activity in facial muscles in volved in
genera ting emotional e xpres sions is univ ersal , and indee d, this ide a was sugg ested in the la te 19th c entur y in
Charles Dar win’s bookThe Expres sion o f Emotions in Man and Animals (1872) .In fact , there is subs tantial
evidenc e for sev enuniv ersal emotions that are e ach as sociated with dis tinct facial e xpres sions . These include:
happines s, surprise , sadnes s, fright , dis gust, contempt , and ang er (Figure 10.24 ) (Ekman & K eltner , 1997).350 10 • Emo tion and Mo tivation

Of c ourse , emotion is not only displa yed through facial e xpres sion . We also use the tone o f our v oices, various
behaviors , and b ody langua ge to c ommunic ate inf orma tion a bout our emotional s tates.Body langua geis the
expres sion o f emotion in terms o f body p osition or mo vement . Research sugg ests tha t we are quite sensitiv e to

Emotional Expr ession and Emotion R egulation
Autism spectrum disor der (ASD) is a set o f neur odevelopmental disor ders char acterized b y repetitiv e beha viors and
communication and social pr oblems . Childr en who ha ve autism spectrum disor ders ha ve difficul ty recognizing the
emotional s tates o f others , and r esear ch has sho wn that this ma y stem fr om an inability t o dis tinguish v arious
nonverbal e xpressions o f emotion (i. e., facial e xpressions) fr om one another (Hobson, 1986). In addition, ther e is
evidenc e to sug gest that autis tic individuals also ha ve difficul ty expressing emotion thr ough t one o f voice and b y
producing facial e xpressions (Mac donald et al ., 1989). Difficul ties with emotional r ecognition and e xpression ma y
contribut e to the beha viors that char acterize autism; ther efore, various ther apeutic appr oaches ha ve been e xplor ed
to addr ess these difficul ties. Various educational curricula , cognitiv e-beha vioral ther apies , and pharmac ological

10.4 Emotion
Emotions are subjectiv e experienc es tha t consis t of ph ysiologic al arousal and c ognitiv e appraisal . Various
theories ha ve been put f orward to e xplain our emotional e xperienc es. The J ames -Lang e theor y as serts tha t
emotions arise as a function o f ph ysiologic al arousal . The C annon-Bard theor y maintains tha t emotional
experienc e occurs simultaneous to and indep endent o f ph ysiologic al arousal . The Schachter -Sing er tw o-factor
theor y sugg ests tha t ph ysiologic al arousal rec eives c ognitiv e labels as a function o f the relev ant c onte xt and
that these tw o factors tog ether result in an emotional e xperienc e.
The limbic s ystem is the brain ’s emotional circuit , which includes the am ygdala and the hipp ocampus . Both o f
these s tructures are implic ated in pla ying a role in normal emotional pro cessing as w ell as in ps ychologic al
mood and anxiety disorders . Incre ased am ygdala activity is as sociated with le arning to f ear, and it is seen in
individuals who are a t risk f or or suff ering from mo od disorders . The v olume o f the hipp ocampus has b een354 10 • Summar y

individuals and the w orld around them . Our p ersonalities are thought to b e long term , stable, and not e asily

FIGURE 11.2 Happ y, sad, impatient, sh y, fearful, curious , help ful. What char acteristics describe y our personality?
Historical P erspectives
The c oncept o f personality has b een s tudie d for a t least 2,000 y ears, beginning with Hipp ocrates in 370 BCE
(Fazeli, 2012). Hipp ocrates theoriz ed tha t personality traits and human b ehaviors are b ased on f our sep arate
temp eraments as sociated with f our fluids (“humors”) o f the b ody: choleric temp erament ( yellow bile from the
liver), melancholic temp erament ( black bile from the kidne ys), sanguine temp erament (re d blo od from the
heart), and phlegma tic temp erament ( white phlegm from the lungs) (Clark & W atson , 2008; Ey senck &
Eysenck , 1985; Lec ci & Ma gnavita, 2013; N oga, 2007). C enturies la ter, the influential Greek ph ysician and
philosopher Galen built on Hipp ocrates’s theor y, sugg esting tha t both dise ases and p ersonality diff erenc es
could b e explaine d by imb alanc es in the humors and tha t each p erson e xhibits one o f the f our temp eraments .
For e xample , the choleric p erson is p assiona te, ambitious , and b old; the melancholic p erson is reser ved,
anxious , and unhapp y; the sanguine p erson is jo yful, eager, and optimis tic; and the phlegma tic p erson is c alm ,
relia ble, and thoughtful (Clark & W atson , 2008; Stelmack & Stalikas , 1991). G alen ’s theor y was prev alent f or
over 1,000 y ears and c ontinue d to b e popular through the Middle Ag es.
In 1780, F ranz G all, a German ph ysician , prop osed tha t the dis tanc es b etween bumps on the sk ull rev eal a
person ’s personality traits , character , and mental a bilities ( Figure 11.3 ). According to G all, me asuring these
distanc es rev ealed the siz es o f the brain are as underne ath, pro viding inf orma tion tha t could b e use d to
determine whether a p erson w as friendly , prideful , murderous , kind , good with langua ges, and so on . Initially ,
phrenolog y was v ery popular; ho wever, it w as so on discre dite d for lack o f empiric al supp ort and has long b een
releg ated to the s tatus o f pseudoscienc e (Fancher , 1979).360 11 • P ersonality

(in the 19th c entur y) (Ey senck , 2009; Stelmack & Stalikas , 1991; W undt , 1874/1886) ( Figure 11.4 ). Kant a gree d
with G alen tha t everyone c ould b e sor ted into one o f the f our temp eraments and tha t there w as no o verlap
between the f our c ategories (Ey senck , 2009). He dev elop ed a lis t of traits tha t could b e use d to describ e the
personality o f a p erson from e ach o f the f our temp eraments . Ho wever, Wundt sugg ested tha t a b etter
description o f personality c ould b e achiev ed using tw o major ax es: emotional/nonemotional and chang eable/
unchang eable. The firs t axis sep arated strong from w eak emotions (the melancholic and choleric
temp eraments from the phlegma tic and sanguine). The sec ond axis divide d the chang eable temp eraments
(choleric and sanguine) from the unchang eable ones (melancholic and phlegma tic) (Ey senck , 2009).11.1 • Wha t Is Personality? 361

Sigmund F reud ’s ps ychodynamic p ersp ectiv e of personality w as the firs t comprehensiv e theor y of personality ,

influenc ed by se x and a ggres sion , along with childho od se xuality , are the f orces tha t influenc e our p ersonality .

study and theoriz e the w orkings o f the unc onscious mind in the manner tha t we as sociate with mo dern
psycholog y.
In the e arly y ears o f his c areer , Freud w orked with J osef Breuer , a V iennese ph ysician . During this time , Freud
became intrigue d by the s tory of one o f Breuer ’s patients , Ber tha P app enheim , who w as ref erre d to b y the
pseudon ym Anna O . (La uner , 2005). Anna O . had b een c aring f or her dying fa ther when she b egan to
experienc e symptoms such as p artial p araly sis, headaches , blurre d vision , amnesia, and hallucina tions
(Launer , 2005). In F reud ’s da y, these s ymptoms w ere c ommonly ref erre d to as h ysteria. Anna O . turne d to
Breuer f or help . He sp ent 2 y ears (1880–1882) tre ating Anna O . and disc overed tha t allo wing her to talk a bout
her e xperienc es seeme d to bring some relief o f her s ymptoms . Anna O . called his tre atment the “ talking cure ”
(Launer , 2005). Despite the fact tha t Freud nev er met Anna O ., her s tory ser ved as the b asis f or the 1895 b ook,
Studies on Hy steria , which he c o-authore d with Breuer . Base d on Breuer ’s description o f Anna O .’s tre atment ,
Freud c onclude d tha t hysteria w as the result o f sexual a buse in childho od and tha t these tra uma tic
experienc es had b een hidden from c onsciousnes s. Breuer disa gree d with F reud , which so on ende d their w ork
together . Ho wever, Freud c ontinue d to w ork to refine talk therap y and build his theor y on p ersonality .
Levels of Consciousness
To explain the c oncept o f conscious v ersus unc onscious e xperienc e, Freud c omp ared the mind to an ic eberg
(Figure 11.5 ). He said tha t only a bout one -tenth o f our mind is conscious , and the res t of our mind is
unc onscious . Our unc onscious ref ers to tha t mental activity o f which w e are una ware and are una ble to ac cess
(Freud , 1923). A ccording to F reud , unac cepta ble urg es and desires are k ept in our unc onscious through a
process called repres sion . For e xample , we sometimes sa y things tha t we don ’t intend to sa y by unintentionally
subs tituting another w ord f or the one w e me ant. You’ve prob ably he ard o f a F reudian slip , the term use d to
describ e this . Freud sugg ested tha t slips o f the tongue are actually se xual or a ggres sive urg es, accidentally
slipping out o f our unc onscious . Speech errors such as this are quite c ommon . Seeing them as a reflection o f
unc onscious desires , linguis ts to day ha ve found tha t slips o f the tongue tend to o ccur when w e are tire d,
nervous, or not a t our optimal lev el of cognitiv e functioning (Motle y, 2002).
FIGURE 11.5 Freud belie ved that w e are onl y aware of a smal l amount o f our mind’ s activities and that mos t of it11.2 • F reud and the P sychodynamic P erspectiv e363
remains hidden fr om us in our unc onscious . The inf ormation in our unc onscious aff ects our beha vior, although w e
are una ware of it.
According to F reud , our p ersonality dev elops from a c onflict b etween tw o forces: our biologic al aggres sive and
pleasure -seeking driv es v ersus our internal (so cializ ed) control o ver these driv es. Our p ersonality is the result
of our eff orts to b alanc e these tw o comp eting f orces. Freud sugg ested tha t we can unders tand this b y
ima gining three interacting s ystems within our minds . He c alled them the id , ego, and sup ereg o (Figure 11.6 ).
FIGURE 11.6 The job o f the eg o, or self , is t o balanc e the ag gressive/pleasur e-seeking driv es o f the id with the
mor al contr ol of the super ego.
The unc onscious idcontains our mos t primitiv e driv es or urg es, and is present from bir th. It directs impulses
for hung er, thirs t, and se x. Freud b eliev ed tha t the id op erates on wha t he c alled the “ple asure principle ,” in
which the id seeks imme diate gra tific ation . Through so cial interactions with p arents and others in a child ’s
environment , the eg o and sup ereg o dev elop to help c ontrol the id . The sup ereg odevelops as a child interacts
with others , learning the so cial r ules f or right and wrong . The sup ereg o acts as our c onscienc e; it is our moral
comp ass tha t tells us ho w w e should b ehave. It s trives for p erfection and judg es our b ehavior , leading to
feelings o f pride or —when w e fall shor t of the ide al—feelings o f guilt . In c ontras t to the ins tinctual id and the
rule-based sup ereg o, the egois the ra tional p art of our p ersonality . It’s wha t Freud c onsidere d to b e the self,
and it is the p art of our p ersonality tha t is seen b y others . Its job is to b alanc e the demands o f the id and
supereg o in the c onte xt of reality; thus , it op erates on wha t Freud c alled the “re ality principle .” The eg o helps
the id sa tisfy its desires in a re alistic w ay.
The id and sup ereg o are in c onstant c onflict , because the id w ants ins tant gra tific ation reg ardles s of the
conse quenc es, but the sup ereg o tells us tha t we mus t behave in so cially ac cepta ble w ays. Thus , the eg o’s job is
to find the middle ground . It helps sa tisfy the id ’s desires in a ra tional w ay tha t will not le ad us to f eelings o f
guilt . According to F reud , a p erson who has a s trong eg o, which c an b alanc e the demands o f the id and the
supereg o, has a he alth y personality . Freud maintaine d tha t imb alanc es in the s ystem c an le ad to neurosis (a
tendency to e xperienc e neg ative emotions), anxiety disorders , or unhe alth y behaviors . For e xample , a p erson
who is domina ted by their id might b e narcis sistic and impulsiv e. A p erson with a dominant sup ereg o might b e
controlle d by feelings o f guilt and den y themselv es ev en so cially ac cepta ble ple asures; c onversely , if the
supereg o is w eak or a bsent , a p erson might b ecome a ps ychop ath. An o verly dominant sup ereg o might b e seen
in an o ver-controlle d individual whose ra tional grasp on re ality is so s trong tha t the y are una ware o f their
emotional nee ds, or, in a neurotic who is o verly def ensiv e (overusing eg o def ense mechanisms).
Def ense Mechanisms
Freud b eliev ed tha t feelings o f anxiety result from the eg o’s ina bility to me diate the c onflict b etween the id and
supereg o. When this happ ens, Freud b eliev ed tha t the eg o seeks to res tore b alanc e through v arious protectiv e
measures kno wn as def ense mechanisms ( Figure 11.7 ). When c ertain ev ents , feelings , or y earnings c ause an
individual anxiety , the individual wishes to re duce tha t anxiety . To do tha t, the individual ’s unc onscious mind
uses eg odefense mechanisms , unc onscious protectiv e behaviors tha t aim to re duce anxiety . The eg o, usually364 11 • P ersonality

conscious , resor ts to unc onscious s trivings to protect the eg o from b eing o verwhelme d by anxiety . When w e
use def ense mechanisms , we are una ware tha t we are using them . Further , the y op erate in v arious w ays tha t
distort reality . According to F reud , we all use eg o def ense mechanisms .
FIGURE 11.7 Defense mechanisms ar e unc onscious pr otectiv e beha viors that w ork t o reduc e anxiety .
While ev eryone uses def ense mechanisms , Freud b eliev ed tha t overuse o f them ma y be problema tic. For

“macho ,” making g ay jok es, and picking on a scho ol peer who is g ay. This w ay, Joe’s unc onscious impulses are
further submerg ed.
There are sev eral diff erent typ es o f def ense mechanisms . For ins tanc e, in repres sion , anxiety -causing
memories from c onsciousnes s are blo cked. As an analog y, let’s sa y your c ar is making a s trang e noise , but
because y ou do not ha ve the mone y to g et it fix ed, you jus t turn up the radio so tha t you no long er he ar the
strang e noise . Eventually y ou f orget about it . Similarly , in the human ps yche, if a memor y is to o overwhelming
to de al with , it might b erepres sedand thus remo ved from c onscious a warenes s (Freud , 1920). This repres sed
memor y might c ause s ymptoms in other are as.
Another def ense mechanism is reaction f ormat ion, in which someone e xpres ses f eelings , thoughts , and
behaviors opp osite to their inclina tions . In the a bove example , Joe made fun o f a g ay peer while himself b eing
attracte d to males . Inregres sion , an individual acts much y oung er than their a ge. For e xample , a four-year-old
child who resents the arriv al of a newb orn sibling ma y act lik e a b aby and rev ert to drinking out o f a b ottle. In
project ion, a p erson refuses to ackno wledge her o wn unc onscious f eelings and ins tead sees those f eelings in
someone else . Other def ense mechanisms include rationalizat ion,displac ement , and sublimat ion.

Stages of Psychose xual Development
Freud b eliev ed tha t personality dev elops during e arly childho od: Childho od experienc es shap e our
personalities as w ell as our b ehavior as adults . He as serted tha t we dev elop via a series o f stages during
childho od. Each o f us mus t pass through these childho od stages, and if w e do not ha ve the prop er nur turing
and p arenting during a s tage, we will b e stuck , or fixa ted, in tha t stage, even as adults .
In e ach psychose xual s tage of de velopment , the child ’s ple asure -seeking urg es, coming from the id , are
focuse d on a diff erent are a of the b ody, called an erog enous z one. The s tages are oral , anal , phallic , latency , and
genital ( Table 11.1 ).
Freud ’s ps ychose xual dev elopment theor y is quite c ontro versial . To unders tand the origins o f the theor y, it is
helpful to b e familiar with the p olitic al, social, and cultural influenc es o f Freud ’s da y in V ienna a t the turn o f
the 20th c entur y. During this era, a clima te of sexual repres sion , combine d with limite d unders tanding and
education surrounding human se xuality , heavily influenc ed Freud ’s persp ectiv e. Giv en tha t sex was a ta boo
topic , Freud as sume d tha t neg ative emotional s tates (neuroses) s temme d from suppres sion o f unc onscious
sexual and a ggres sive urg es. For F reud , his o wn rec ollections and interpreta tions o f patients’ e xperienc es and
dreams w ere sufficient pro of tha t psychose xual s tages w ere univ ersal ev ents in e arly childho od.

TABLE 11.1
Oral Stage
In the oral s tage(birth to 1 y ear), ple asure is f ocuse d on the mouth . Eating and the ple asure deriv ed from
sucking (nipples , pacifiers , and thumbs) pla y a larg e part in a b aby’s firs t year o f life. At around 1 y ear o f age,
babies are w eaned from the b ottle or bre ast, and this pro cess can cre ate conflict if not handle d prop erly b y
caregiv ers. According to F reud , an adult who smok es, drinks , overeats, or bites her nails is fixa ted in the oral
stage of her ps ychose xual dev elopment; she ma y ha ve been w eaned to o early or to o late, resulting in these
fixation tendencies , all o f which seek to e ase anxiety .
Anal Stage
After p assing through the oral s tage, children enter wha t Freud terme d the anal s tage(1–3 y ears). In this s tage,
children e xperienc e ple asure in their b owel and bladder mo vements , so it mak es sense tha t the c onflict in this
stage is o ver toilet training . During this s tage of dev elopment , children w ork to mas ter c ontrol o f themselv es.
Freud sugg ested tha t suc cess at the anal s tage dep ende d on ho w parents handle d toilet training . Parents who
offer praise and rew ards enc oura ge positiv e results and c an help children f eel c omp etent . Parents who are
harsh in toilet training c an c ause a child to b ecome so f earful o f soiling tha t the y over-control and b ecome
fixated at the anal s tage, leading to the dev elopment o f an anal-retentiv e personality . The anal-retentiv e
personality is s ting y and s tubb orn, has a c ompulsiv e nee d for order and ne atnes s, and might b e considere d a
perfectionis t. If p arents are to o lenient in toilet training , the child ma y fail to dev elop sufficient self -control ,
become fixa ted at this s tage, and dev elop an anal-e xpulsiv e personality . The anal-e xpulsiv e personality is
mes sy, careles s, disorg aniz ed, and prone to emotional outburs ts.
Phallic Stage
Freud ’s third s tage of psychose xual dev elopment is the phallic s tage(3–6 y ears), c orresp onding to the a ge
when children b ecome a ware o f their b odies and rec ogniz e the diff erenc es b etween b oys and girls . The
erog enous z one in this s tage is the g enitals . Conflict arises when the child f eels a desire f or the opp osite -sex
parent , and je alous y and ha tred to ward the same -sex parent . For b oys, this is c alled the Oe dipus c omple x,
involving a b oy's desire f or his mother and his urg e to replac e his fa ther who is seen as a riv al for the mother ’s
attention . At the same time , the b oy is a fraid his fa ther will punish him f or his f eelings , so he e xperienc es
castration anxiety . The Oe dipus c omple x is suc cessfully resolv ed when the b oy begins to identif y with his
father as an indirect w ay to ha ve the mother . Failure to resolv e the Oe dipus c omple x ma y result in fixa tion and
development o f a p ersonality tha t might b e describ ed as v ain and o verly ambitious .
Girls e xperienc e a c omp arable c onflict in the phallic s tage—the Electra c omple x. The Electra c omple x, while
often a ttribute d to F reud , was actually prop osed by Freud ’s protég é, Carl J ung (J ung & K eren yi, 1963). A girl
desires the a ttention o f her fa ther and wishes to tak e her mother ’s plac e. Jung also said tha t girls are angr y
with the mother f or not pro viding them with a p enis —which he terme dpenis en vy. While F reud initially
embrac ed the Electra c omple x as a p arallel to the Oe dipus c omple x, he la ter rejecte d it, yet it remains as a
corners tone o f Freudian theor y, thanks in p art to ac ademics in the field (F reud , 1931/1968; Sc ott, 2005).
Latency P eriod
Following the phallic s tage of psychose xual dev elopment is a p erio d kno wn as the latency p erio d(6 years to
pub erty). This p erio d is not c onsidere d a s tage, because se xual f eelings are dormant as children f ocus on other
pursuits , such as scho ol, friendships , hobbies , and sp orts. Children g enerally eng age in activities with p eers o f
the same se x, which ser ves to c onsolida te a child ’s gender -role identity .11.2 • F reud and the P sychodynamic P erspectiv e367
Genital Stage
The final s tage is the genital s tage(from pub erty on). In this s tage, there is a se xual re awakening as the
incestuous urg es resur face. The y oung p erson re directs these urg es to other , more so cially ac cepta ble p artners
(who o ften resemble the other -sex parent). P eople in this s tage ha ve ma ture se xual interes ts, which f or F reud
meant a s trong desire f or the opp osite se x. Individuals who suc cessfully c omplete d the previous s tages,
reaching the g enital s tage with no fixa tions , are said to b e well-b alanc ed, health y adults .
While mos t of Freud ’s ide as ha ve not f ound supp ort in mo dern rese arch , and sev eral c ontemp orar y
rese archers rejecte d his premises , we cannot disc ount the c ontributions tha t Freud has made to the field o f
psycholog y. It w as F reud who p ointe d out tha t a larg e part of our mental lif e is influenc ed by the e xperienc es o f
early childho od and tak es plac e outside o f our c onscious a warenes s; his theories p aved the w ay for others .
While F reud's f ocus on biologic al driv es le d him to emphasiz e the imp act o f sociocultural factors on
personality dev elopment , his f ollowers quickly re alized tha t biolog y alone c ould not ac count f or the div ersity

deemphasiz ed se x, focusing more on the so cial en vironment and eff ects o f culture on p ersonality . Four nota ble
neo -Freudians include A lfred Adler , Erik Erikson , Carl J ung (pronounc ed “Yoong ”), and K aren Horne y
(pronounc ed “HORN-e ye”).
Alfr ed Adler
AlfredAdler , a c olleague o f Freud ’s and the firs t president o f the V ienna P sychoanalytic al So ciety (F reud ’s
inner circle o f colleagues), w as the firs t major theoris t to bre ak a way from F reud ( Figure 11.8 ). He
subse quently f ounde d a scho ol of psycholog y calledindividual psy cholog y, which f ocuses on our driv e to
comp ensa te for feelings o f inf eriority . Adler (1937, 1956) prop osed the c oncept o f the inferiorit y comple x. An
inferiority c omple x ref ers to a p erson ’s feelings tha t the y lack w orth and don ’t me asure up to the s tandards o f
others or o f society . Adler ’s ide as a bout inf eriority represent a major diff erenc e between his thinking and
Freud ’s. Freud b eliev ed tha t we are motiv ated by se xual and a ggres sive urg es, but A dler (1930, 1961) b eliev ed
that feelings o f inf eriority in childho od are wha t driv e people to a ttempt to g ain sup eriority and tha t this
striving is the f orce behind all o f our thoughts , emotions , and b ehaviors .368 11 • P ersonality

FIGURE 11.8 Alfred Adler pr oposed the c oncept of the inf eriority c omple x.
Adler also b eliev ed in the imp ortanc e of social c onnections , seeing childho od dev elopment emerging through
social dev elopment ra ther than the se xual s tages F reud outline d. Adler note d the inter -rela tednes s of
humanity and the nee d to w ork tog ether f or the b etterment o f all. He said , “The happines s of mankind lies in
working tog ether , in living as if e ach individual had set himself the task o f contributing to the c ommon w elfare ”
(Adler , 1964, p . 255) with the main g oal of psycholog y being “ to rec ogniz e the e qual rights and e quality o f
others” (A dler , 1961, p . 691).
With these ide as, Adler identifie d three fundamental so cial tasks tha t all o f us mus t experienc e: occup ational
tasks (c areers), so cietal tasks (friendship), and lo ve tasks (finding an intima te p artner f or a long-term
rela tionship). Ra ther than f ocus on se xual or a ggres sive motiv es for b ehavior as F reud did , Adler f ocuse d on
social motiv es. He also emphasiz ed conscious ra ther than unc onscious motiv ation , sinc e he b eliev ed tha t the
three fundamental so cial tasks are e xplicitly kno wn and pursue d. Tha t is not to sa y tha t Adler did not also
believ e in unc onscious pro cesses—he did—but he f elt tha t conscious pro cesses w ere more imp ortant .
One o f Adler ’s major c ontributions to p ersonality ps ycholog y was the ide a tha t our bir th order shap es our
personality . He prop osed tha t older siblings , who s tart out as the f ocus o f their p arents’ a ttention but mus t
share tha t attention onc e a new child joins the family , comp ensa te by becoming o verachiev ers. The y oung est
children , according to A dler , ma y be sp oiled, leaving the middle child with the opp ortunity to minimiz e the
negative dynamics o f the y oung est and oldes t children . Despite p opular a ttention , rese arch has not

FIGURE 11.9 Carl Jung w as int erested in e xploring the c ollectiv e unc onscious .
Jung ’s split from F reud w as b ased on tw o major disa greements . First, Jung , like Adler and Erikson , did not
accept tha t sexual driv e was the primar y motiv ator in a p erson ’s mental lif e. Sec ond , although J ung a gree d
with F reud ’s concept o f a p ersonal unc onscious , he thought it to b e inc omplete . In addition to the p ersonal
unc onscious , Jung f ocuse d on the c ollectiv e unc onscious .
The collect ive unc onscious is a univ ersal v ersion o f the p ersonal unc onscious , holding mental p atterns , or
memor y trac es, which are c ommon to all o f us (J ung , 1928). These anc estral memories , which J ung c alled
archet ypes, are represente d by univ ersal themes in v arious cultures , as e xpres sed through litera ture , art, and
dreams (J ung ). Jung said tha t these themes reflect c ommon e xperienc es o f people the w orld o ver, such as
facing de ath, becoming indep endent , and s triving f or mas tery. Jung (1964) b eliev ed tha t through biolog y, each
person is hande d do wn the same themes and tha t the same typ es o f symb ols—such as the hero , the maiden ,
the sa ge, and the tricks ter—are present in the f olklore and fair y tales o f every culture . In J ung ’s view , the task o f
integra ting these unc onscious archetyp al asp ects o f the self is p art of the self -realiza tion pro cess in the sec ond
half o f life. With this orienta tion to ward self -realiza tion , Jung p arted ways with F reud ’s belief tha t personality is
determine d solely b y past events and anticip ated the humanis tic mo vement with its emphasis on self -
actualiza tion and orienta tion to ward the future .
Jung also prop osed tw o attitudes or appro aches to ward lif e: extro version and intro version (J ung , 1923) ( Table
11.3 ). These ide as are c onsidere d Jung ’s mos t imp ortant c ontributions to the field o f personality ps ycholog y,
as almos t all mo dels o f personality no w include these c oncepts . If y ou are an e xtro vert, then y ou are a p erson
who is energiz ed by being out going and so cially oriente d: You deriv e your energ y from b eing around others . If
you are an intro vert, then y ou are a p erson who ma y be quiet and reser ved, or y ou ma y be so cial, but y our
energ y is deriv ed from y our inner ps ychic activity . Jung b eliev ed a b alanc e between e xtro version and
intro version b est ser ved the g oal of self -realiza tion .

Are Ar chetypes Genetically Based?
Jung pr oposed that human r esponses t o archetypes ar e similar t o ins tinctual r esponses in animals . One criticism o f
Jung is that ther e is no e videnc e that ar chetypes ar e biological ly based or similar t o animal ins tincts (R oesler , 2012).
Jung f ormulat ed his ideas about 100 y ears ag o, and gr eat adv ances ha ve been made in the field o f genetics sinc e
that time . We’ve found that human babies ar e born with c ertain capacities , including the ability t o ac quire lang uage.
However, we’ve also f ound that s ymbolic inf ormation (such as ar chetypes) is not enc oded on the g enome and that
babies cannot dec ode s ymbolism, r efuting the idea o f a biological basis t o archetypes . Rather than being seen as
purely biological , mor e recent r esear ch sug gests that ar chetypes emer ge dir ectly from our e xperienc es and ar e
reflections o f ling uistic or cul tural char acteristics ( Young-Eisendr ath, 1995). T oday, mos t Jungian scholars belie ve
that the c ollectiv e unc onscious and ar chetypes ar e based on both innat e and en vironmental influenc es, with the
differences being in the r ole and degr ee o f each (Sotir ova-Kohli et al ., 2013).

blocked by basic anxiety s temming from nee ds not b eing met , such as childho od experienc es o f lonelines s
and/or isola tion . Ho w do children le arn to handle this anxiety? Horne y sugg ested three s tyles o f coping ( Table
11.4 ). The firs t coping s tyle,moving to ward p eople , relies on a ffilia tion and dep endenc e. These children
become dep endent on their p arents and other c aregiv ers in an eff ort to rec eive attention and a ffection , which
provides relief from anxiety (B urger, 2008). When these children gro w up , the y tend to use this same c oping
strategy to de al with rela tionships , expres sing an intense nee d for lo ve and ac ceptanc e (B urger, 2008). The
second c oping s tyle,moving a gains t people , relies on a ggres sion and as sertivenes s. Children with this c oping
style find tha t fighting is the b est way to de al with an unhapp y home situa tion , and the y de al with their f eelings
of insecurity b y bullying other children (B urger, 2008). As adults , people with this c oping s tyle tend to lash out
with hur tful c omments and e xploit others (B urger, 2008). The third c oping s tyle,moving a way from p eople ,
centers on detachment and isola tion . These children handle their anxiety b y withdra wing from the w orld . The y
need priv acy and tend to b e self -sufficient . When these children are adults , the y continue to a void such things
as lo ve and friendship , and the y also tend to gra vitate to ward c areers tha t require lit tle interaction with others
(Burger, 2008).

As y ou ma y rec all from y our s tudy on the ps ycholog y of learning , Skinner prop osed tha t we demons trate
consis tent b ehavior p atterns b ecause w e ha ve dev elop ed certain resp onse tendencies (Skinner , 1953). In other
words , welearn to b ehave in p articular w ays. We incre ase the b ehaviors tha t lead to p ositiv e conse quenc es,
and w e decre ase the b ehaviors tha t lead to neg ative conse quenc es. Skinner disa gree d with F reud ’s ide a tha t
personality is fix ed in childho od. He argue d tha t personality dev elops o ver our entire lif e, not only in the firs t
few y ears. Our resp onses c an chang e as w e come acros s new situa tions; theref ore, we can e xpect more
varia bility o ver time in p ersonality than F reud w ould anticip ate. For e xample , consider a y oung w oman , Greta,
a risk tak er. She driv es fas t and p articip ates in dang erous sp orts such as hang gliding and kiteb oarding . But
after she g ets marrie d and has children , the s ystem o f reinf orcements and punishments in her en vironment
chang es. Speeding and e xtreme sp orts are no long er reinf orced, so she no long er eng ages in those b ehaviors .
In fact , Greta no w describ es herself as a c autious p erson .
The Social-Cognitive P erspective
AlbertBandura agree d with Skinner tha t personality dev elops through learning . He disa gree d, however, with
Skinner ’s strict b ehavioris t appro ach to p ersonality dev elopment , because he f elt tha t thinking and re asoning
are imp ortant c omp onents o f learning . He presente d asocial-c ognit ive theor yof personality tha t emphasiz es
both le arning and c ognition as sourc es o f individual diff erenc es in p ersonality . In so cial-c ognitiv e theor y, the
concepts o f recipro cal determinism , obser vational le arning , and self -effic acy all pla y a p art in p ersonality
development .
Recipr ocal Determinism
In contras t to Skinner ’s ide a tha t the en vironment alone determines b ehavior , Bandura (1990) prop osed the
concept o frecipro cal determinism , in which c ognitiv e pro cesses, behavior , and c onte xt all interact , each
factor influencing and b eing influenc ed by the others simultaneously ( Figure 11.10 ).Cognitiv e pro cesses refer
to all characteris tics previously le arne d, including b eliefs , expecta tions , and p ersonality characteris tics.
Beha vior refers to an ything tha t we do tha t ma y be rew arde d or punishe d. Finally , the conte xtin which the
behavior o ccurs ref ers to the en vironment or situa tion , which includes rew arding /punishing s timuli .
FIGURE 11.10 Bandur a proposed the idea o f recipr ocal det erminism: Our beha vior, cognitiv e processes, and
situational c ontext al l influenc e each other .
Consider , for e xample , tha t you’re a t a festival and one o f the a ttractions is bung ee jumping from a bridg e. Do
you do it? In this e xample , the b ehavior is bung ee jumping . Cognitiv e factors tha t might influenc e this b ehavior374 11 • P ersonality

include y our b eliefs and v alues , and y our p ast experienc es with similar b ehaviors . Finally , conte xt ref ers to the
rew ard s tructure f or the b ehavior . According to recipro cal determinism , all o f these factors are in pla y.
Observ ational Learning
Bandura ’s key contribution to le arning theor y was the ide a tha t much le arning is vic arious . We learn b y
obser ving someone else ’s behavior and its c onse quenc es, which Bandura c alled obser vational le arning . He f elt
that this typ e of learning also pla ys a p art in the dev elopment o f our p ersonality . Just as w e learn individual
behaviors , we learn new b ehavior p atterns when w e see them p erforme d by other p eople or mo dels . Dra wing
on the b ehavioris ts’ ide as a bout reinf orcement , Bandura sugg ested tha t whether w e cho ose to imita te a
model’s behavior dep ends on whether w e see the mo del reinf orced or punishe d. Through obser vational
learning , we come to le arn wha t behaviors are ac cepta ble and rew arde d in our culture , and w e also le arn to
inhibit deviant or so cially unac cepta ble b ehaviors b y seeing wha t behaviors are punishe d.
We can see the principles o f recipro cal determinism a t work in obser vational le arning . For e xample , personal
factors determine which b ehaviors in the en vironment a p erson cho oses to imita te, and those en vironmental
events in turn are pro cessed cognitiv ely ac cording to other p ersonal factors . One p erson ma y experienc e
receiving a ttention as reinf orcing , and tha t person ma y be more incline d to imita te behaviors such as b oasting
when a mo del has b een reinf orced. For others , boasting ma y be view ed neg atively, despite the a ttention tha t
might result —or rec eiving heightene d attention ma y be perceived as b eing scr utiniz ed. In either c ase, the
person ma y be les s lik ely to imita te those b ehaviors ev en though the re asons f or not doing so w ould b e
different .
Self -Efficacy
Bandura (1977, 1995) has s tudie d a numb er o f cognitiv e and p ersonal factors tha t affect le arning and
personality dev elopment , and mos t rec ently has f ocuse d on the c oncept o f self -effic acy.Self -effic acy is our
level of confidenc e in our o wn a bilities , dev elop ed through our so cial e xperienc es. Self -effic acy a ffects ho w w e
appro ach challeng es and re ach g oals. In obser vational le arning , self -effic acy is a c ognitiv e factor tha t affects
which b ehaviors w e cho ose to imita te as w ell as our suc cess in p erforming those b ehaviors .
People who ha ve high self -effic acy b eliev e tha t their g oals are within re ach, have a p ositiv e view o f challeng es
seeing them as tasks to b e mas tere d, dev elop a deep interes t in and s trong c ommitment to the activities in
which the y are in volved, and quickly rec over from setb acks . Conversely , people with lo w self -effic acy a void
challenging tasks b ecause the y doubt their a bility to b e suc cessful, tend to f ocus on failure and neg ative
outc omes , and lose c onfidenc e in their a bilities if the y experienc e setb acks . Feelings o f self -effic acy c an b e
specific to c ertain situa tions . For ins tanc e, a s tudent might f eel c onfident in her a bility in English clas s but
much les s so in ma th clas s.
Julian R otter and Locus of Contr ol
Julian Rotter(1966) prop osed the c oncept o f locus o f control , another c ognitiv e factor tha t affects le arning and
personality dev elopment . Dis tinct from self -effic acy, which in volves our b elief in our o wn a bilities ,locus of
control refers to our b eliefs a bout the p ower w e ha ve over our liv es. In R otter’s view , people p ossess either an
internal or an e xternal lo cus o f control ( Figure 11.11 ). Those o f us with an internal lo cus o f control (“internals”)
tend to b eliev e tha t mos t of our outc omes are the direct result o f our eff orts. Those o f us with an e xternal lo cus
of control (“ externals”) tend to b eliev e tha t our outc omes are outside o f our c ontrol . Externals see their liv es as
being c ontrolle d by other p eople , luck , or chanc e. For e xample , say you didn ’t spend much time s tudying f or
your ps ycholog y tes t and w ent out to dinner with friends ins tead. When y ou rec eive your tes t score, you see

Walter Mischel and the P erson-Situation Debate
Walter Mischel was a s tudent o f Julian R otter and ta ught f or y ears a t Stanf ord, where he w as a c olleague o f
Albert Bandura. Mischel sur veyed sev eral dec ades o f empiric al ps ychologic al litera ture reg arding trait
prediction o f behavior , and his c onclusion sho ok the f ounda tions o f personality ps ycholog y. Mischel f ound tha t
the da ta did not supp ort the c entral principle o f the field—tha t a p erson ’s personality traits are c onsis tent
acros s situa tions . His rep ort trigg ered a dec ades -long p erio d of self -examina tion , kno wn as the p erson-
situa tion deb ate, among p ersonality ps ychologis ts.
Mischel sugg ested tha t perhaps w e were lo oking f or c onsis tency in the wrong plac es. He f ound tha t although
behavior w as inc onsis tent acros s diff erent situa tions , it w as much more c onsis tent within situa tions —so tha t a
person ’s behavior in one situa tion w ould lik ely b e rep eated in a similar one . And as y ou will see ne xt reg arding
his famous “marshmallo w tes t,” Mischel also f ound tha t behavior is c onsis tent in e quiv alent situa tions acros s
time .
One o f Mischel ’s mos t nota ble c ontributions to p ersonality ps ycholog y was his ide as on self -regula tion .
According to Lec ci & Ma gnavita (2013), “ Self -regula tion is the pro cess of identif ying a g oal or set o f goals and ,
in pursuing these g oals, using b oth internal (e .g., thoughts and a ffect) and e xternal (e .g., resp onses o f an ything
or an yone in the en vironment) f eedback to maximiz e goal attainment ” (p. 6.3). Self -regula tion is also kno wn as
will p ower. When w e talk a bout will p ower, we tend to think o f it as the a bility to dela y gra tific ation . For
example , Bet tina ’s teena ge son made s trawberry cup cakes, and the y looked delicious . Ho wever, Bet tina
forfeite d the ple asure o f eating one , because she is training f or a 5K rac e and w ants to b e fit and do w ell in the
race. Would y ou b e able to resis t getting a small rew ard no w in order to g et a larg er rew ard la ter? This is the
ques tion Mischel in vestigated in his no w-clas sic marshmallo w tes t.
Mischel designe d a s tudy to as sess self -regula tion in y oung children . In the marshmallo w study , Mischel and
his c olleagues plac ed a prescho ol child in a ro om with one marshmallo w on the ta ble. The children w ere told
they could either e at the marshmallo w no w, or w ait until the rese archer returne d to the ro om, and then the y
could ha ve tw o marshmallo ws (Mischel , Ebb esen & Rask off, 1972). This w as rep eated with hundre ds o f
prescho olers . Wha t Mischel and his te am f ound w as tha t young children diff er in their degree o f self -control .
Mischel and his c olleagues c ontinue d to f ollow this group o f prescho olers through high scho ol, and wha t do
you think the y disc overed? The children who had more self -control in prescho ol (the ones who w aite d for the
bigg er rew ard) w ere more suc cessful in high scho ol. The y had higher S AT sc ores , had p ositiv e peer
rela tionships , and w ere les s lik ely to ha ve subs tanc e abuse is sues; as adults , the y also had more s table
marria ges (Mischel , Sho da, & R odrigue z, 1989; Mischel et al ., 2010). On the other hand , those children who had
poor self -control in prescho ol (the ones who gra bbed the one marshmallo w) were not as suc cessful in high
scho ol, and the y were f ound to ha ve ac ademic and b ehavioral problems . A more rec ent s tudy using a larg er
and more representa tive sample f ound as sociations b etween e arly dela y of gra tific ation ( Watts, Dunc an, &

associations w ere not as s trong as those rep orted during Mischel's initial e xperiment and w ere quite sensitiv e
to situa tional factors such as e arly me asures o f cognitiv e capacity , family b ackground , and home en vironment .
This rese arch sugg ests tha t considera tion o f situa tional factors is imp ortant to b etter unders tand b ehavior .

Today, the deb ate is mos tly resolv ed, and mos t psychologis ts consider b oth the situa tion and p ersonal factors

•Discus s the c ontributions o f Abr aham Maslo w and Carl R ogers t o personality de velopment
As the “ third f orce” in ps ycholog y,humanism is toute d as a re action b oth to the p essimis tic determinism o f
psychoanaly sis, with its emphasis on ps ychologic al dis turb ance, and to the b ehavioris ts’ view o f humans
passively re acting to the en vironment , which has b een criticiz ed as making p eople out to b e personality -less
robots. It do es not sugg est tha t psychoanalytic , behavioris t, and other p oints o f view are inc orrect but argues
that these p ersp ectiv es do not rec ogniz e the depth and me aning o f human e xperienc e, and fail to rec ogniz e the
inna te capacity f or self -directe d chang e and trans forming p ersonal e xperienc es. This p ersp ectiv e focuses on
how he alth y people dev elop . One pioneering humanis t, Abraham Maslo w, studie d people who he c onsidere d to
be he alth y, cre ative, and pro ductiv e, including A lbert Eins tein , Ele anor R oosev elt, Thomas J efferson , Abraham
Linc oln, and others . Maslo w (1950, 1970) f ound tha t such p eople share similar characteris tics, such as b eing
open, cre ative, loving , spontaneous , comp assiona te, concerne d for others , and ac cepting o f themselv es. When
you s tudie d motiv ation , you le arne d about one o f the b est-kno wn humanis tic theories , Maslo w's hierarch y of
needs theor y, in which Maslo w prop oses tha t human b eings ha ve certain nee ds in c ommon and tha t these
needs mus t be met in a c ertain order . The highes t nee d is the nee d for self -actualiza tion , which is the
achiev ement o f our fulles t potential . Maslo w diff erentia ted between nee ds tha t motiv ate us to fulfill something
that is mis sing and nee ds tha t inspire us to gro w. He b eliev ed tha t man y emotional and b ehavioral c oncerns
arise as a result o f failing to meet these hierarchic al nee ds.
Another humanis tic theoris t was C arl R ogers. One o f Rogers’s main ide as a bout p ersonality reg ards self -
conc ept, our thoughts and f eelings a bout ourselv es. Ho w w ould y ou resp ond to the ques tion , “Who am I? ” Your
answer can sho w ho w you see y ourself. If y our resp onse is primarily p ositiv e, then y ou tend to f eel g ood about
who y ou are , and y ou see the w orld as a sa fe and p ositiv e plac e. If y our resp onse is mainly neg ative, then y ou
may feel unhapp y with who y ou are . Rogers fur ther divide d the self into tw o categories: the ide al self and the
real self. The ideal self is the p erson tha t you w ould lik e to b e; the real self is the p erson y ou actually are .
Rogers f ocuse d on the ide a tha t we nee d to achiev e consis tency b etween these tw o selv es. We experienc e
congr uenc ewhen our thoughts a bout our re al self and ide al self are v ery similar —in other w ords , when our
self-concept is ac cura te.High c ongr uenc e leads to a gre ater sense o f self -worth and a he alth y, pro ductiv e life.
Parents c an help their children achiev e this b y giving them unc onditional p ositiv e reg ard, or unc onditional
love. According to R ogers (1980), “ As p ersons are ac cepte d and priz ed, the y tend to dev elop a more c aring
attitude to wards themselv es” (p . 116). C onversely , when there is a gre at discrep ancy b etween our ide al and

predisp ositions as w ell as ph ysiologic al pro cesses c an b e use d to e xplain diff erenc es in our p ersonalities
(Burger, 2008).
Evolutionar y ps ycholog y rela tive to p ersonality dev elopment lo oks a t personality traits tha t are univ ersal , as
well as diff erenc es acros s individuals . In this view , adaptiv e diff erenc es ha ve ev olved and then pro vide a

several re asons . Certain individual diff erenc es, and the herita bility o f these characteris tics, have been w ell
documente d. David B uss has identifie d sev eral theories to e xplore this rela tionship b etween p ersonality traits
and ev olution , such as lif e-his tory theor y, which lo oks a t ho w people e xpend their time and energ y (such as on
bodily gro wth and maintenanc e, repro duction , or p arenting ). Another e xample is c ostly signaling theor y,
which e xamines the hones ty and dec eption in the signals p eople send one another a bout their quality as a
mate or friend (B uss, 2009).

pessimis tic? Mo ody or ev en-temp ered? Early trait theoris ts trie d to describ e all human p ersonality traits . For
example , one trait theoris t, Gordon A llport (Allport & Odb ert, 1936), f ound 4,500 w ords in the English langua ge
that could describ e people . He org aniz ed these p ersonality traits into three c ategories: c ardinal traits , central
traits , and sec ondar y traits . A c ardinal trait is one tha t domina tes y our entire p ersonality , and henc e your
life—such as Eb enezer Scro oge’s gree d and Mother Theresa ’s altr uism . Cardinal traits are not v ery common:
Few p eople ha ve personalities domina ted by a single trait . Ins tead, our p ersonalities typic ally are c omp osed of
multiple traits . Central traits are those tha t mak e up our p ersonalities (such as lo yal, kind , agree able, friendly ,
sneaky, wild , and grouch y). Sec ondar y traits are those tha t are not quite as ob vious or as c onsis tent as c entral
traits . The y are present under sp ecific circums tanc es and include pref erenc es and a ttitudes . For e xample , one
person g ets angr y when p eople tr y to tickle him; another c an only sleep on the left side o f the b ed; and y et
another alw ays orders her salad dres sing on the side . And y ou—although not normally an anxious p erson— feel
nervous b efore making a sp eech in front o f your English clas s.
In an eff ort to mak e the lis t of traits more mana geable, Raymond C attell (1946, 1957) narro wed do wn the lis t to
about 171 traits . Ho wever, saying tha t a trait is either present or a bsent do es not ac cura tely reflect a p erson ’s
uniquenes s, because all o f our p ersonalities are actually made up o f the same traits; w e diff er only in the
degree to which e ach trait is e xpres sed. Cattell (1957) identifie d 16 factors or dimensions o f personality:
warmth , reasoning , emotional s tability , dominanc e, livelines s, rule-consciousnes s, social b oldnes s, sensitivity ,
vigilanc e, abstracte dnes s, priv atenes s, apprehension , opennes s to chang e, self -relianc e, perfectionism , and
tension ( Table 11.5 ). He dev elop ed a p ersonality as sessment b ased on these 16 factors , called the 16PF .
Instead o f a trait b eing present or a bsent , each dimension is sc ored over a c ontinuum , from high to lo w. For
example , your lev el of warmth describ es ho w w arm , caring , and nic e to others y ou are . If y ou sc ore lo w on this

According to their theor y, people high on the trait o f extro version are so ciable and out going , and re adily
connect with others , where as p eople high on the trait o f intro version ha ve a higher nee d to b e alone , eng age in
solitar y behaviors , and limit their interactions with others . In the neuroticism/s tability dimension , people high
on neuroticism tend to b e anxious; the y tend to ha ve an o veractiv e symp athetic ner vous s ystem and , even with
low stres s, their b odies and emotional s tate tend to g o into a flight -or-fight re action . In c ontras t, people high on
stability tend to nee d more s timula tion to activ ate their flight -or-fight re action and are c onsidere d more
emotionally s table. Base d on these tw o dimensions , the Ey sencks’ theor y divides p eople into f our quadrants .
These quadrants are sometimes c omp ared with the f our temp eraments describ ed by the Greeks: melancholic ,
choleric , phlegma tic, and sanguine ( Figure 11.13 ).11.7 • T rait Theoris ts 381
FIGURE 11.13 The Ey senck s described tw o fact ors t o ac count f or variations in our personalities: e xtroversion/
introversion and emotional s tability /instability .
Later, the Ey sencks adde d a third dimension: ps ychoticism v ersus sup ereg o control (Ey senck , Eysenck &
Barret t, 1985). In this dimension , people who are high on ps ychoticism tend to b e indep endent think ers, cold,
nonc onformis ts, impulsiv e, antiso cial, and hos tile, where as p eople who are high on sup ereg o control tend to
have high impulse c ontrol—the y are more altr uistic, emp athetic , cooperative, and c onventional (Ey senck ,
Eysenck & Barret t, 1985).
While C attell’s 16 factors ma y be too bro ad, the Ey senck ’s tw o-factor s ystem has b een criticiz ed for b eing to o
narro w. Another p ersonality theor y, called the Five Factor Mo del, effectiv ely hits a middle ground , with its fiv e
factors ref erre d to as the Big F ive personality factors . It is the mos t popular theor y in p ersonality ps ycholog y
today and the mos t accura te appro xima tion o f the b asic p ersonality dimensions (F under , 2001). The fiv e
factors are op ennes s to e xperienc e, conscientiousnes s, extro version , agree ablenes s, and neuroticism ( Figure
11.14 ). A helpful w ay to rememb er the factors is b y using the mnemonic O CEAN .
In the F ive Factor Mo del, each p erson has e ach factor , but the y occur along a sp ectr um. Op ennes s to
experienc e is characteriz ed by ima gina tion , feelings , actions , and ide as. People who sc ore high on this factor
tend to b e curious and ha ve a wide rang e of interes ts. Conscientiousnes s is characteriz ed by comp etenc e, self -
discipline , thoughtfulnes s, and achiev ement -striving ( goal-directe d behavior). P eople who sc ore high on this
factor are hardw orking and dep enda ble. Numerous s tudies ha ve found a p ositiv e correla tion b etween
conscientiousnes s and ac ademic suc cess (Akomola fe, 2013; Chamorro -Premuzic & F urnham , 2008; C onrad &
Patry, 2012; N oftle & R obins , 2007; W agerman & F under , 2007). Extro version is characteriz ed by so ciability ,
assertivenes s, excitement -seeking , and emotional e xpres sion . People who sc ore high on this factor are usually
describ ed as out going and w arm . Not surprisingly , people who sc ore high on b oth e xtro version and op ennes s
are more lik ely to p articip ate in adv enture and risky sp orts due to their curious and e xcitement -seeking na ture
(Tok, 2011). The f ourth factor is a gree ablenes s, which is the tendency to b e ple asant , cooperative, trustworthy,
and g ood-na ture d. People who sc ore lo w on a gree ablenes s tend to b e describ ed as r ude and unc ooperative, yet
one rec ent s tudy rep orted tha t men who sc ored low on this factor actually e arne d more mone y than men who
were c onsidere d more a gree able (J udg e, Livings ton, & Hurs t, 2012). The las t of the Big F ive factors is382 11 • P ersonality

neuroticism , which is the tendency to e xperienc e neg ative emotions . People high on neuroticism tend to
experienc e emotional ins tability and are characteriz ed as angr y, impulsiv e, and hos tile. Watson and Clark
(1984) f ound tha t people rep orting high lev els o f neuroticism also tend to rep ort feeling anxious and unhapp y.
In contras t, people who sc ore lo w in neuroticism tend to b e calm and ev en-temp ered.

The Big F ive personality factors e ach represent a rang e between tw o extremes . In re ality , mos t of us tend to lie
somewhere midw ay along the c ontinuum o f each factor , rather than a t polar ends . It’s imp ortant to note tha t
the Big F ive factors are rela tively s table o ver our lif espan, with some tendency f or the factors to incre ase or
decre ase slightly . Researchers ha ve found tha t conscientiousnes s incre ases through y oung adultho od into
middle a ge, as w e become b etter a ble to mana ge our p ersonal rela tionships and c areers (Donnellan & L ucas,
2008). Agree ablenes s also incre ases with a ge, peaking b etween 50 to 70 y ears ( Terrac ciano , McC rae, Brant , &
Costa, 2005). N euroticism and e xtro version tend to decline slightly with a ge (Donnellan & L ucas; T errac ciano
et al .). A dditionally , The Big F ive factors ha ve been sho wn to e xist acros s ethnicities , cultures , and a ges, and
may ha ve subs tantial biologic al and g enetic c omp onents (J ang , Liv esle y, & V ernon , 1996; J ang et al ., 2006;
McC rae & C osta, 1997; Schmit t et al ., 2007).
Another mo del o f personality traits is the HEX ACO mo del. HEX ACO is an acron ym f or six bro ad traits: hones ty-
humility , emotionality , extra version , agree ablenes s, conscientiousnes s, and op ennes s to e xperienc e (Anglim &

11.8 Cultur al Understandings of P ersonality
LEARNING OBJEC TIVES
By the end o f this section y ou should b e able to:
•Discus s personality diff erences o f people fr om c ollectivis t and individualis t cul tures
•Discus s the thr ee appr oaches t o studying personality in a cul tural context
As y ou ha ve learne d in this chapter , personality is shap ed by both g enetic and en vironmental factors . The
culture in which y ou liv e is one o f the mos t imp ortant en vironmental factors tha t shap es y our p ersonality
(Triandis & Suh , 2002). The term culture refers to all o f the b eliefs , cus toms , art, and traditions o f a p articular
society . Culture is transmit ted to p eople through langua ge as w ell as through the mo deling o f culturally
accepta ble and nonac cepta ble b ehaviors tha t are either rew arde d or punishe d (Triandis & Suh , 2002). W ith
these ide as in mind , personality ps ychologis ts ha ve become interes ted in the role o f culture in unders tanding
personality . The y ask whether p ersonality traits are the same acros s cultures or if there are v aria tions . It
app ears tha t there are b oth univ ersal and culture -specific asp ects tha t account f or v aria tion in p eople ’s
personalities .
Why might it b e imp ortant to c onsider cultural influenc es on p ersonality? W estern ide as a bout p ersonality
may not b e applic able to other cultures (Benet -Mar tine z & Oishi , 2008). In fact , there is evidenc e tha t the
strength o f personality traits v aries acros s cultures . Let ’s tak e a lo ok a t some o f the Big F ive factors
(conscientiousnes s, neuroticism , opennes s, and e xtro version) acros s cultures . As y ou will le arn when y ou
study so cial ps ycholog y, Asian cultures are more c ollectivis t, and p eople in these cultures tend to b e les s
extro verted. People in C entral and South Americ an cultures tend to sc ore higher on op ennes s to e xperienc e,
where as Europ eans sc ore higher on neuroticism (Benet -Mar tine z & K arakitap oglu-A ygun , 2003).
According to a s tudy b y Rentfro w and c olleagues , there also seem to b e regional p ersonality diff erenc es within
the Unite d Sta tes ( Figure 11.15 ). Researchers analyz ed resp onses from o ver 1.5 million individuals in the
Unite d Sta tes and f ound tha t there are three dis tinct regional p ersonality clus ters: Clus ter 1, which is in the
Upp er Midw est and Deep South , is domina ted by people who fall into the “friendly and c onventional ”
personality; Clus ter 2, which includes the W est, is domina ted by people who are more relax ed, emotionally

stable, calm , and cre ative; and Clus ter 3, which includes the N ortheast, has more p eople who are s tres sed,
irrita ble, and depres sed. People who liv e in Clus ters 2 and 3 are also g enerally more op en (R entfro w et al .,
2013).
FIGURE 11.15 Resear chers f ound thr ee dis tinct r egional personality clus ters in the Unit ed Stat es. People t end t o be
friendl y and c onventional in the Upper Midw est and Deep South; r elax ed, emotional ly stable , and cr eativ e in the
West; and s tressed, irritable , and depr essed in the Nor theas t (Rentfrow et al ., 2013).
One e xplana tion f or the regional diff erenc es is select ive migrat ion (Rentfro w et al ., 2013). Selectiv e migra tion
is the c oncept tha t people cho ose to mo ve to plac es tha t are c omp atible with their p ersonalities and nee ds. For
example , a p erson high on the a gree able sc ale w ould lik ely w ant to liv e ne ar family and friends , and w ould
choose to set tle or remain in such an are a. In c ontras t, someone high on op ennes s would pref er to set tle in a
plac e tha t is rec ogniz ed as div erse and inno vative (such as C alifornia). F urther , Rentfro w, Jost, Gosling , & P otter
(2009) note d an o verlap b etween g eographic al regions and p ersonality characteris tics tha t goes b eyond the
often-use d explana tions o f religion , racial div ersity , and e duc ation . Their rese arch sugg ests tha t the
psychologic al pro file o f a region is closely rela ted to tha t of its residents . The y found tha t lev els o f op ennes s
and c onscientiousnes s in a s tate ma y pre dict v oting p atterns , indic ating tha t there are c orrela tions b etween
geographic regions and p ersonality diff erenc es b etween lib erals and c onser vatives rela ting to p olitic al view s,
levels o f economic vitality , and entrepreneurial ra tes.
Personality in Individualist and Collectivist Cultur es
Individualis t cultures and c ollectivis t cultures plac e emphasis on diff erent b asic v alues . People who liv e in
individualis t cultures tend to b eliev e tha t indep endenc e, comp etition , and p ersonal achiev ement are
imp ortant . Individuals in W estern na tions such as the Unite d Sta tes, England , and A ustralia sc ore high on11.8 • Cul tural Unders tandings o f Personality 385
individualism (O yserman , Coon, & K emmelmier , 2002). P eople who liv e in c ollectivis t cultures v alue so cial
harmon y, resp ectfulnes s, and group nee ds o ver individual nee ds. Individuals who liv e in c ountries in Asia,
Afric a, and South Americ a sc ore high on c ollectivism (Ho fstede, 2001; T riandis , 1995). These v alues influenc e
personality . For e xample , Yang (2006) f ound tha t people in individualis t cultures displa yed more p ersonally
oriente d personality traits , where as p eople in c ollectivis t cultures displa yed more so cially oriente d personality
traits . Frew er and Bleus (1991) c onducte d a s tudy o f the Ey senk P ersonality In ventor y in a c ollectivis t culture
using P apua N ew Guine an univ ersity s tudents . The y found tha t the results o f the p ersonality in ventor y were
only relev ant when analyz ed within the c onte xt of a c ollectivis t society . Similarly , Dana (1986) sugg ested tha t
personality as sessment ser vices for N ative Americ ans are o ften pro vide d without a prop er rec ognition o f
culture -specific resp onses and a trib e-specific frame o f ref erenc e. Assessors nee d to ha ve more than a g eneral
kno wledge of his tory, trib al diff erenc es, contemp orar y culture on reser vations , and lev els o f accultura tion in
order to interpret ps ychologic al tes t resp onses with a minimal bias .
Appr oaches to Studying P ersonality in a Cultur al Conte xt
There are three appro aches tha t can b e use d to s tudy p ersonality in a cultural c onte xt, the cultural-
comp arative appro ach; the indig enous appro ach; and the combine d appro ach, which inc orporates elements o f
both view s. Sinc e ide as a bout p ersonality ha ve a W estern b asis , the cultural-c omp arative appro ach seeks to
test Western ide as a bout p ersonality in other cultures to determine whether the y can b e generaliz ed and if
they ha ve cultural v alidity (Cheung v an de V ijver, & Leong , 2011). F or e xample , rec all from the previous section
on the trait p ersp ectiv e tha t rese archers use d the cultural-c omp arative appro ach to tes t the univ ersality o f
McC rae and C osta’s Five Factor Mo del. The y found applic ability in numerous cultures around the w orld , with
the Big F ive factors b eing s table in man y cultures (McC rae & C osta, 1997; McC rae et al ., 2005). The indig enous
appro ach c ame a bout in re action to the dominanc e of Western appro aches to the s tudy o f personality in non-
Western set tings (Cheung et al ., 2011). Bec ause W estern-b ased personality as sessments c annot fully c apture
the p ersonality c onstructs o f other cultures , the indig enous mo del has le d to the dev elopment o f personality
assessment ins truments tha t are b ased on c onstructs relev ant to the culture b eing s tudie d (Cheung et al .,
2011). The third appro ach to cros s-cultural s tudies o f personality is the c ombine d appro ach, which ser ves as a
bridg e between W estern and indig enous ps ycholog y as a w ay of unders tanding b oth univ ersal and cultural
varia tions in p ersonality (Cheung et al ., 2011).

Roberto, Mikhail , and N at are c olleg e friends and all w ant to b e police officers. Roberto is quiet and sh y, lacks
self-confidenc e, and usually f ollows others . He is a kind p erson , but lacks motiv ation . Mikhail is loud and
boisterous , a le ader . He w orks hard , but is impulsiv e and drinks to o much on the w eekends . Nat is thoughtful
and w ell lik ed. The y are tr ustworthy, but are v ery metho dical and theref ore ha ve difficulty making quick
decisions . Of these three , who w ould mak e the b est police officer? Wha t qualities and p ersonality factors mak e
someone a g ood police officer? Wha t mak es someone a b ad or dang erous p olice officer?
A police officer’s job is v ery high in s tres s, and la w enf orcement a gencies w ant to mak e sure the y hire the right
people . Personality tes ting is o ften use d for this purp ose—to screen applic ants f or emplo yment and job
training . Personality tes ts are also use d in criminal c ases and cus tody b attles, and to as sess ps ychologic al
disorders . This section e xplores the b est kno wn among the man y diff erent typ es o f personality tes ts.
Self -Report Inventories
Self -rep ort inventories are a kind o f objectiv e tes t use d to as sess personality . The y typic ally use multiple -
choic e items or numb ered sc ales , which represent a rang e from 1 (s trongly disa gree) to 5 (s trongly a gree).386 11 • P ersonality
Access for fr ee a t opens tax. org
The y often are c alled Lik ert scales a fter their dev elop er, Rensis Lik ert (1932) ( Figure 11.16 ). Self -rep ort
inventories are g enerally e asy to adminis ter and c ost eff ectiv e. There is also an incre ased lik eliho od of tes t
takers b eing incline d to ans wer in w ays tha t are intentionally or unintentionally more so cially desira ble,
exaggerated, biase d, or misle ading . For e xample , someone applying f or a job will lik ely tr y to present
themselv es in a p ositiv e light , perhaps as an ev en b etter c andida te than the y actually are .
FIGURE 11.16 If you’ve ever tak en a sur vey, you ar e probabl y familiar with Lik ert-type scale ques tions . Mos t
personality in ventories emplo y these types o f response scales .
One o f the mos t widely use d personality in ventories is the Minnesota Mult iphasic P ersonalit y In ventor y
(MMPI) , firs t publishe d in 1943, with 504 tr ue/false ques tions , and up dated to the MMPI-2 in 1989, with 567
ques tions . The original MMPI w as b ased on a small , limite d sample , comp osed mos tly o f Minnesota farmers
and ps ychia tric p atients; the revise d in ventor y was b ased on a more representa tive, national sample to allo w
for b etter s tandardiza tion . The MMPI-2 tak es 1–2 hours to c omplete . Responses are sc ored to pro duce a
clinic al pro file c omp osed of 10 sc ales: h ypochondriasis , depres sion , hysteria, ps ychop athic devianc e (so cial
devianc e), masculinity v ersus f emininity , paranoia, ps ychas thenia (obses sive/compulsiv e qualities),
schiz ophrenia, h ypomania, and so cial intro version . There is also a sc ale to asc ertain risk factors f or alc ohol
abuse . In 2008, the tes t was a gain revise d, using more adv anced metho ds, to the MMPI-2-RF . This v ersion
takes a bout one -half the time to c omplete and has only 338 ques tions ( Figure 11.17 ). Despite the new tes t’s
advanta ges, the MMPI-2 is more es tablishe d and is s till more widely use d. Typic ally, the tes ts are adminis tere d
by computer . Although the MMPI w as originally dev elop ed to as sist in the clinic al dia gnosis o f psychologic al
disorders , it is no w also use d for o ccup ational screening , such as in la w enf orcement , and in c olleg e, career ,
and marital c ounseling (Ben-P orath & T elleg en, 2008).
FIGURE 11.17 These true/false ques tions r esemble the kinds o f ques tions y ou w ould find on the MMPI.11.9 • P ersonality As sessment 387
In addition to clinic al sc ales , the tes ts also ha ve validity and relia bility sc ales . (Recall the c oncepts o f relia bility
and v alidity from y our s tudy o f psychologic al rese arch .) One o f the v alidity sc ales , the Lie Sc ale (or “L ” Sc ale),
consis ts of 15 items and is use d to asc ertain whether the resp ondent is “faking g ood” (underrep orting
psychologic al problems to app ear he althier). F or e xample , if someone resp onds “ yes” to a numb er o f
unre alistically p ositiv e items such as “I ha ve nev er told a lie ,” the y ma y be trying to “fak e good” or app ear
better than the y actually are .
Reliability sc ales tes t an ins trument ’s consis tency o ver time , assuring tha t if y ou tak e the MMPI-2-RF to day and
then a gain 5 y ears la ter, your tw o sc ores will b e similar . Beutler , Nus sbaum, and Mere dith (1988) g ave the
MMPI to newly recr uite d police officers and then to the same p olice officers 2 y ears la ter. After 2 y ears on the
job, police officers’ resp onses indic ated an incre ased vulnera bility to alc oholism , soma tic s ymptoms ( vague,
une xplaine d ph ysical complaints), and anxiety . When the tes t was giv en an additional 2 y ears la ter (4 y ears
after s tarting on the job), the results sugg ested high risk f or alc ohol-rela ted difficulties .
Projective T ests
Another metho d for as sessment o f personality is project ive tes ting. This kind o f tes t relies on one o f the
defense mechanisms prop osed by Freud—projection—as a w ay to as sess unc onscious pro cesses. During this
type of tes ting , a series o f ambiguous c ards is sho wn to the p erson b eing tes ted, who then is enc oura ged to
project their f eelings , impulses , and desires onto the c ards —by telling a s tory, interpreting an ima ge, or
completing a sentenc e. Man y projectiv e tes ts ha ve underg one s tandardiza tion pro cedures (f or e xample , Exner ,
2002) and c an b e use d to ac cess whether someone has unusual thoughts or a high lev el of anxiety , or is lik ely
to b ecome v olatile. Some e xamples o f projectiv e tes ts are the R orschach Inkblot T est, the Thema tic
Apperception T est (TAT), the C ontemp oriz ed-Themes C oncerning Blacks tes t, the TEMAS ( Tell-Me -A-Stor y),
and the R otter Inc omplete Sentenc e Blank (RISB). Projectiv e tes ts are les s subject to intentional dis tortion; it is
hard to fak e “good" b ecause it is not ob vious wha t a "g ood” ans wer is . Projectiv e tes ts are more time
consuming f or the ev alua tor than self -rep ort inventories . If an ev alua tor sc ores the R orschach using the Exner
scoring s ystem , the tes t is c onsidere d a v alid and relia ble me asure . Ho wever, the v alidity o f the other projectiv e
tests is ques tiona ble, and the results are o ften not usa ble f or c ourt cases (Golds tein , n.d.).
The Rorschach Inkblot T estwas dev elop ed in 1921 b y a Swis s ps ychologis t name d Hermann R orschach
(pronounc ed “R OAR-sho ck”). It is a series o f symmetric al inkblot c ards tha t are presente d to a client b y a
psychologis t. Up on presenta tion o f each c ard, the ps ychologis t asks the client , “Wha t might this b e?” Wha t the
test-tak er sees rev eals unc onscious f eelings and s truggles (Piotro wski, 1987; W einer , 2003). The R orschach
has b een s tandardiz ed using the Exner s ystem and is eff ectiv e in me asuring depres sion , psychosis , and
anxiety .
A sec ond projectiv e tes t is the Themat ic A pperception T est (TAT), cre ated in the 1930s b y Henr y Murra y, an
Americ an ps ychologis t, and a ps ychoanaly st name d Chris tiana Morg an. A p erson taking the T AT is sho wn
8–12 ambiguous pictures and is ask ed to tell a s tory about e ach picture ( Figure 11.18 ). The s tories giv e insight
into their so cial w orld , rev ealing hop es, fears, interes ts, and g oals. The s torytelling f orma t helps to lo wer a
person ’s resis tanc e divulging unc onscious p ersonal details (C ramer , 2004). The T AT has b een use d in clinic al
settings to ev alua te ps ychologic al disorders; more rec ently , it has b een use d in c ounseling set tings to help
clients g ain a b etter unders tanding o f themselv es and achiev e personal gro wth . Standardiza tion o f tes t
adminis tration is vir tually none xistent among clinicians , and the tes t tends to b e mo dest to lo w on v alidity and
relia bility (Arono w, Weiss, & R ezink off, 2001; Lilienf eld, Wood, & G arb, 2000). Despite these shor tcomings , the
TAT has b een one o f the mos t widely use d projectiv e tes ts.388 11 • P ersonality

FIGURE 11.18 This imag e from the Thematic Apper ception T ests (TAT) can be used in c ounseling set tings .
A third projectiv e tes t is the Rotter Inc omplete Sentenc e Blank (RISB) develop ed by Julian R otter in 1950
(rec all his theor y of locus o f control , covered earlier in this chapter). There are three f orms o f this tes t for use
with diff erent a ge groups: the scho ol form , the c olleg e form , and the adult f orm . The tes ts include 40
incomplete sentenc es tha t people are ask ed to c omplete as quickly as p ossible ( Figure 11.19 ). The a verage
time f or c ompleting the tes t is appro xima tely 20 minutes , as resp onses are only 1–2 w ords in length . This tes t
is similar to a w ord as sociation tes t, and lik e other typ es o f projectiv e tes ts, it is presume d tha t resp onses will
reveal desires , fears, and s truggles . The RISB is use d in screening c olleg e students f or adjus tment problems
and in c areer c ounseling (Holada y, Smith , & Sherr y, 2010; R otter & Ra fferty 1950).
FIGURE 11.19 These inc omplet e sent ences resemble the types o f ques tions on the RISB . Ho w would y ou c omplet e
these sent ences?
For man y dec ades , these traditional projectiv e tes ts ha ve been use d in cros s-cultural p ersonality as sessments .
However, it w as found tha t tes t bias limite d their usefulnes s (Ho y-Watkins & J enkins -Mo ore, 2008). It is
difficult to as sess the p ersonalities and lif estyles o f memb ers o f widely div ergent ethnic /cultural groups using
personality ins truments b ased on da ta from a single culture or rac e (Ho y-Watkins & J enkins -Mo ore, 2008). F or
example , when the T AT was use d with Afric an-Americ an tes t tak ers, the result w as o ften shor ter s tory length

Summary
11.1 What Is P ersonality?
Personality has b een s tudie d for o ver 2,000 y ears, beginning with Hipp ocrates. More rec ent theories o f
personality ha ve been prop osed, including F reud ’s ps ychodynamic p ersp ectiv e, which holds tha t personality is
forme d through e arly childho od experienc es. Other p ersp ectiv es then emerg ed in re action to the
psychodynamic p ersp ectiv e, including the le arning , humanis tic, biologic al, trait , and cultural p ersp ectiv es.
11.2 Freud and the Psychodynamic P erspective
Sigmund F reud presente d the firs t comprehensiv e theor y of personality . He w as also the firs t to rec ogniz e tha t
much o f our mental lif e tak es plac e outside o f our c onscious a warenes s. Freud also prop osed three
comp onents to our p ersonality: the id , ego, and sup ereg o. The job o f the eg o is to b alanc e the se xual and
aggres sive driv es o f the id with the moral ide al of the sup ereg o. Freud also said tha t personality dev elops
through a series o f psychose xual s tages. In e ach s tage, ple asure f ocuses on a sp ecific erog enous z one. Failure
to resolv e a s tage can le ad one to b ecome fixa ted in tha t stage, leading to unhe alth y personality traits .
Successful resolution o f the s tages le ads to a he alth y adult .
11.3 Neo-Fr eudians: Adler , Erik son, Jung, and Horney
The neo -Freudians w ere ps ychologis ts whose w ork f ollowed from F reud ’s. The y generally a gree d with F reud
that childho od experienc es ma tter, but the y decre ased the emphasis on se x and f ocuse d more on the so cial392 11 • Summar y
Access for fr ee a t opens tax. org
environment and eff ects o f culture on p ersonality . Some o f the nota ble neo -Freudians are A lfred Adler , Carl
Jung , Erik Erikson , and K aren Horne y. The neo -Freudian appro aches ha ve been criticiz ed, because the y tend
to b e philosophic al ra ther than b ased on sound scientific rese arch . For e xample , Jung ’s conclusions a bout the
existenc e of the c ollectiv e unc onscious are b ased on m yths , leg ends , dre ams , and ar t. In addition , as with
Freud ’s ps ychoanalytic theor y, the neo -Freudians b ased much o f their theories o f personality on inf orma tion
from their p atients .
11.4 Learning Appr oaches
Beha vioral theoris ts view p ersonality as signific antly shap ed and imp acte d by the reinf orcements and
conse quenc es outside o f the org anism . People b ehave in a c onsis tent manner b ased on prior le arning . B. F.
Skinner , a prominent b ehavioris t, said tha t we demons trate consis tent b ehavior p atterns , because w e ha ve
develop ed certain resp onse tendencies . Mischel f ocuse d on ho w personal g oals pla y a role in the self -
regula tion pro cess. Albert Bandura said tha t one ’s en vironment c an determine b ehavior , but a t the same time ,
people c an influenc e the en vironment with b oth their thoughts and b ehaviors , which is kno wn as recipro cal
determinism . Bandura also emphasiz ed ho w w e learn from w atching others . He f elt tha t this typ e of learning
also pla ys a p art in the dev elopment o f our p ersonality . Bandura discus sed the c oncept o f self -effic acy, which is
our lev el of confidenc e in our o wn a bilities . Finally , Rotter prop osed the c oncept o f locus o f control , which
refers to our b eliefs a bout the p ower w e ha ve over our liv es. He said tha t people fall along a c ontinuum b etween
a purely internal and a purely e xternal lo cus o f control .
11.5 Humanistic Appr oaches
Humanis tic ps ychologis ts Abraham Maslo w and C arl R ogers f ocuse d on the gro wth p otential o f he alth y
individuals . The y believ ed tha t people s trive to b ecome self -actualiz ed. Both R ogers’s and Maslo w’s theories
greatly c ontribute d to our unders tanding o f the self. The y emphasiz ed free will and self -determina tion , with
each individual desiring to b ecome the b est person the y can b ecome .
11.6 Biological Appr oaches
Some asp ects o f our p ersonalities are larg ely c ontrolle d by genetics; ho wever, environmental factors (such as
family interactions) and ma tura tion c an a ffect the w ays in which children ’s personalities are e xpres sed.
11.7 Trait Theorists
Trait theoris ts attempt to e xplain our p ersonality b y identif ying our s table characteris tics and w ays of
behaving . The y ha ve identifie d imp ortant dimensions o f personality . The F ive Factor Mo del is the mos t widely
accepte d theor y today. The fiv e factors are op ennes s, conscientiousnes s, extro version , agree ablenes s, and
neuroticism . These factors o ccur along a c ontinuum .
11.8 Cultur al Understandings of P ersonality
The culture in which y ou liv e is one o f the mos t imp ortant en vironmental factors tha t shap es y our p ersonality .
Western ide as a bout p ersonality ma y not b e applic able to other cultures . In fact , there is evidenc e tha t the
strength o f personality traits v aries acros s cultures . Individualis t cultures and c ollectivis t cultures plac e
emphasis on diff erent b asic v alues . People who liv e in individualis t cultures tend to b eliev e tha t indep endenc e,
comp etition , and p ersonal achiev ement are imp ortant . People who liv e in c ollectivis t cultures v alue so cial
harmon y, resp ectfulnes s, and group nee ds o ver individual nee ds. There are three appro aches tha t can b e use d
to study p ersonality in a cultural c onte xt: the cultural-c omp arative appro ach, the indig enous appro ach, and
the c ombine d appro ach, which inc orporates b oth elements o f both view s.
11.9 Personality Assessment
Personality tes ts are techniques designe d to me asure one ’s personality . The y are use d to dia gnose
psychologic al problems as w ell as to screen c andida tes f or c olleg e and emplo yment . There are tw o typ es o f
personality tes ts: self -rep ort inventories and projectiv e tes ts. The MMPI is one o f the mos t common self -rep ort11 • Summar y393
inventories . It asks a series o f true/false ques tions tha t are designe d to pro vide a clinic al pro file o f an
individual . Projectiv e tes ts use ambiguous ima ges or other ambiguous s timuli to as sess an individual ’s
unc onscious f ears, desires , and challeng es. The R orschach Inkblot T est, the T AT, the RISB , and the C -TCB are
all forms o f projectiv e tes ts.

Social psy cholog yexamines ho w people a ffect one another , and it lo oks a t the p ower o f the situa tion .
According to the Americ an P sychologic al As sociation (n .d.), so cial ps ychologis ts "are interes ted in all asp ects
of personality and so cial interaction , exploring the influenc e of interp ersonal and group rela tionships on
human b ehavior ." Throughout this chapter , we will e xamine ho w the presenc e of other individuals and groups
of people imp acts a p erson 's behaviors , thoughts , and f eelings . Essentially , people will chang e their b ehavior to
align with the so cial situa tion a t hand . If w e are in a new situa tion or are unsure ho w to b ehave, we will tak e our
cues from other individuals .
The field o f social ps ycholog y studies topics a t both the intra- and interp ersonal lev els.Intrap ersonal topics
(those tha t pertain to the individual) include emotions and a ttitudes , the self, and so cial c ognition (the w ays in
which w e think a bout ourselv es and others). Interp ersonal topics (those tha t pertain to dy ads and groups)
include helping b ehavior ( Figure 12.2 ), aggres sion , prejudic e and discrimina tion , attraction and close
rela tionships , and group pro cesses and intergroup rela tionships .

Social ps ychologis ts focus on ho w people c onceptualiz e and interpret situa tions and ho w these interpreta tions
influenc e their thoughts , feelings , and b ehaviors (R oss & Nisb ett, 1991). Thus , social ps ycholog y studies
individuals in a so cial c onte xt and ho w situa tional v aria bles interact to influenc e behavior . In this chapter , we

interp ersonal pro cesses o f conformity and ob edienc e, aggres sion and altr uism , and , finally , love and

Situational and Dispositional Influences on Behavior
Beha vior is a pro duct o f both the situa tion (e .g., cultural influenc es, social roles , and the presenc e of
bystanders) and o f the p erson (e .g., personality characteris tics). Subfields o f psycholog y tend to f ocus on one
influenc e or b ehavior o ver others .Situat ionism is the view tha t our b ehavior and actions are determine d by
our imme diate en vironment and surroundings . In c ontras t,disp osit ionism holds tha t our b ehavior is
determine d by internal factors (Heider , 1958). An internal f actor is an a ttribute o f a p erson and includes
personality traits and temp erament . Social ps ychologis ts ha ve tende d to tak e the situa tionis t persp ectiv e,
where as p ersonality ps ychologis ts ha ve promote d the disp ositionis t persp ectiv e. Mo dern appro aches to so cial
psycholog y, however, tak e both the situa tion and the individual into ac count when s tudying human b ehavior
(Fiske, Gilb ert, & Lindz ey, 2010). In fact , the field o f social-p ersonality ps ycholog y has emerg ed to s tudy the
comple x interaction o f internal and situa tional factors tha t affect human b ehavior (Mischel , 1977; Richard ,
Bond , & Stok es-Zoota, 2003).
Fundamental Attribution Err or
In the Unite d Sta tes, the pre dominant culture tends to fa vor a disp ositional appro ach in e xplaining human
behavior . Wh y do y ou think this is? W e tend to think tha t people are in c ontrol o f their o wn b ehaviors , and ,
theref ore, any behavior chang e mus t be due to something internal , such as their p ersonality , habits, or
temp erament . According to some so cial ps ychologis ts, people tend to o veremphasiz e internal factors as
explana tions —or a ttributions —for the b ehavior o f other p eople . The y tend to as sume tha t the b ehavior o f
another p erson is a trait of tha t person , and to underes tima te the p ower o f the situa tion on the b ehavior o f
others . The y tend to fail to rec ogniz e when the b ehavior o f another is due to situa tional v aria bles , and thus to
the p erson ’sstate. This erroneous as sumption is c alled the fundamental attribut ion error (Ross, 1977; Riggio
& Garcia, 2009). T o better unders tand , ima gine this sc enario: J amie returns home from w ork, and op ens the
front do or to a happ y greeting from sp ouse Morg an who inquires ho w the da y has b een. Ins tead o f returning
the sp ouse ’s kind greeting , Jamie y ells, “Le ave me alone!” Wh y did J amie y ell? Ho w w ould someone
commit ting the fundamental a ttribution error e xplain J amie ’s behavior? The mos t common resp onse is tha t
Jamie is a me an, angr y, or unfriendly p erson (traits). This is an internal or disp ositional e xplana tion . Ho wever,
ima gine tha t Jamie w as jus t laid o ff from w ork due to c omp any do wnsizing . Would y our e xplana tion f or Jamie ’s
behavior chang e? Y our revise d explana tion might b e tha t Jamie w as fr ustrated and disapp ointe d about b eing
laid o ff and w as theref ore in a b ad mo od (state). This is no w an e xternal or situa tional e xplana tion f or Jamie ’s
behavior .
The fundamental a ttribution error is so p owerful tha t people o ften o verlo ok ob vious situa tional influenc es on
behavior . A clas sic e xample w as demons trated in a series o f experiments kno wn as the quizmas ter s tudy (R oss,
Ama bile, & Steinmetz, 1977). Student p articip ants w ere randomly as signe d to pla y the role o f a ques tioner (the
quizmas ter) or a c ontes tant in a quiz g ame . Ques tioners dev elop ed difficult ques tions to which the y knew the
answers, and the y presente d these ques tions to the c ontes tants . The c ontes tants ans wered the ques tions
correctly only 4 out o f 10 times ( Figure 12.3 ). After the task , the ques tioners and c ontes tants w ere ask ed to ra te
their o wn g eneral kno wledge comp ared to the a verage student . Ques tioners did not ra te their g eneral
kno wledge higher than the c ontes tants , but the c ontes tants ra ted the ques tioners’ intellig ence higher than
their o wn. In a sec ond s tudy , obser vers o f the interaction also ra ted the ques tioner as ha ving more g eneral
kno wledge than the c ontes tant . The ob vious influenc e on p erformanc e is the situa tion . The ques tioners wrote
the ques tions , so o f course the y had an adv anta ge. Both the c ontes tants and obser vers made an internal
attribution f or the p erformanc e. The y conclude d tha t the ques tioners mus t be more intellig ent than the
contes tants .12.1 • Wha t Is Social P sycholog y? 401

The halo eff ect ref ers to the tendency to let the o verall impres sion o f an individual c olor the w ay in which w e
feel a bout their character . For ins tanc e, we might as sume tha t people who are ph ysically a ttractiv e are more
likely to b e good people than les s attractiv e individuals . Another e xample o f ho w the halo eff ect might manif est
would in volve as suming tha t someone whom w e perceive to b e out going or friendly has a b etter moral
character than someone who is not .
As demons trated in the e xamples a bove, the fundamental a ttribution error is c onsidere d a p owerful influenc e
in ho w w e explain the b ehaviors o f others . Ho wever, it should b e note d tha t some rese archers ha ve sugg ested
that the fundamental a ttribution error ma y not b e as p owerful as it is o ften p ortrayed. In fact , a rec ent review
of more than 173 publishe d studies sugg ests tha t sev eral factors (e .g., high lev els o f idios yncras y of the
character and ho w w ell h ypothetic al ev ents are e xplaine d) pla y a role in determining jus t ho w influential the
fundamental a ttribution error is (Malle , 2006).
Is the Fundamental Attribution Err or a Universal Phenomenon?
You ma y be able to think o f examples o f the fundamental a ttribution error in y our lif e. Do p eople in all cultures
commit the fundamental a ttribution error? R esearch sugg ests tha t the y do not . People from an individualis tic
culture , tha t is, a culture tha t focuses on individual achiev ement and a utonom y, have the gre atest tendency to
commit the fundamental a ttribution error . Individualis tic cultures , which tend to b e found in w estern
countries such as the Unite d Sta tes, Canada, and the Unite d King dom , promote a f ocus on the individual .
Theref ore, a p erson ’s disp osition is thought to b e the primar y explana tion f or her b ehavior . In c ontras t, people
from a collect ivistic culture , tha t is, a culture tha t focuses on c ommunal rela tionships with others , such as
family , friends , and c ommunity ( Figure 12.4 ), are les s lik ely to c ommit the fundamental a ttribution error
(Mark us & Kita yama, 1991; T riandis , 2001).
FIGURE 12.4 People fr om c ollectivis tic cul tures, such as some Asian cul tures, are mor e lik ely to emphasiz e
relationships with others than t o focus primaril y on the individual . Activities such as (a) pr eparing a meal , (b)
hanging out, and (c) pla ying a g ame eng age people in a gr oup. (credit a: modification o f work b y Arian Zw egers;

Why do y ou think this is the c ase? C ollectivis tic cultures , which tend to b e found in e ast Asian c ountries and in
Latin Americ an and Afric an c ountries , focus on the group more than on the individual (Nisb ett, Peng, Choi , &402 12 • Social P sycholog y

rela ted to the fit b etween a p erson and the org aniza tion in which the y work in an Indian sample , but the fit
between the p erson and their sp ecific job w as more pre dictiv e of turno ver in an Americ an sample .
Actor-Observer Bias
Returning to our e arlier e xample , Jamie w as laid o ff, but an obser ver w ould not kno w. So a naïv e obser ver
would tend to a ttribute J amie ’s hos tile b ehavior to J amie ’s disp osition ra ther than to the tr ue, situa tional c ause.
Why do y ou think w e underes tima te the influenc e of the situa tion on the b ehaviors o f others? One re ason is
that we often don ’t ha ve all the inf orma tion w e nee d to mak e a situa tional e xplana tion f or another p erson ’s
behavior . The only inf orma tion w e might ha ve is wha t is obser vable. Due to this lack o f inf orma tion w e ha ve a
tendency to as sume the b ehavior is due to a disp ositional , or internal , factor . When it c omes to e xplaining our
own b ehaviors , however, we ha ve much more inf orma tion a vailable to us . If y ou c ame home from scho ol or
work angr y and y elled at your dog or a lo ved one , wha t would y our e xplana tion b e? Y ou might sa y you w ere
very tire d or f eeling un well and nee ded quiet time —a situa tional e xplana tion . The actor -obser ver bias is the
phenomenon o f attributing other p eople ’s behavior to internal factors (fundamental a ttribution error) while
attributing our o wn b ehavior to situa tional f orces (J ones & Nisb ett, 1971; Nisb ett, Caputo , Leg ant, & Marec ek,
1973; Choi & Nisb ett, 1998). As actors o f behavior , we ha ve more inf orma tion a vailable to e xplain our o wn
behavior . Ho wever as obser vers, we ha ve les s inf orma tion a vailable; theref ore, we tend to defa ult to a
disp ositionis t persp ectiv e.
One s tudy on the actor -obser ver bias in vestigated re asons male p articip ants g ave for wh y the y lik ed their
girlfriend (Nisb ett et al ., 1973). When ask ed wh y particip ants lik ed their o wn girlfriend , particip ants f ocuse d
on internal , disp ositional qualities o f their girlfriends (f or e xample , her ple asant p ersonality ). The p articip ants’
explana tions rarely include d causes internal to themselv es, such as disp ositional traits (f or e xample , “I nee d
comp anionship .”). In c ontras t, when sp ecula ting wh y a male friend lik es his girlfriend , particip ants w ere12.1 • Wha t Is Social P sycholog y? 403
equally lik ely to giv e disp ositional and e xternal e xplana tions . This supp orts the ide a tha t actors tend to pro vide
few internal e xplana tions but man y situa tional e xplana tions f or their o wn b ehavior . In c ontras t, obser vers tend
to pro vide more disp ositional e xplana tions f or a friend ’s behavior ( Figure 12.5 ).
FIGURE 12.5 Actor-obser ver bias is e vident when subjects e xplain their o wn r easons f or liking a girlfriend v ersus
their impr essions o f others’ r easons f or liking a girlfriend.
Self -Serving Bias
We can unders tand self -ser ving bias b y digging more deeply into attribut ion, a b elief a bout the c ause o f a
result . One mo del o f attribution prop oses three main dimensions: lo cus o f control (internal v ersus e xternal),
stability (s table v ersus uns table), and c ontrolla bility (c ontrolla ble v ersus unc ontrolla ble). In this c onte xt,
stability ref ers to the e xtent in which the circums tanc es tha t result in a giv en outc ome are chang eable. The
circums tanc es are c onsidere d stable if the y are unlik ely to chang e. Controlla bility ref ers to the e xtent to which
the circums tanc es tha t are as sociated with a giv en outc ome c an b e controlle d. Ob viously , those things tha t we
have the p ower to c ontrol w ould b e labeled controlla ble ( Weiner , 1979).
Following an outc ome , self -ser ving biases are those a ttributions tha t ena ble us to see ourselv es in a fa vorable
light (f or e xample , making internal a ttributions f or suc cess and e xternal a ttributions f or failures). When y ou do
well a t a task , for e xample acing an e xam , it is in y our b est interes t to mak e a disp ositional a ttribution f or y our
behavior (“I’ m smar t,”) ins tead o f a situa tional one (“ The e xam w as e asy,”).Self -ser ving bias is the tendency to
explain our suc cesses as due to disp ositional (internal) characteris tics, but to e xplain our failures as due to
situa tional (e xternal) factors . Again, this is culture dep endent . This bias ser ves to protect self -esteem . You c an
ima gine tha t if p eople alw ays made situa tional a ttributions f or their b ehavior , the y would nev er b e able to tak e
credit and f eel g ood about their ac complishments .
Consider the e xample o f ho w w e explain our fa vorite sp orts te am’s wins . Research sho ws tha t we mak e
internal , stable, and c ontrolla ble a ttributions f or our te am’s victor y (Figure 12.6 ) (Gro ve, Hanrahan , &
McInman , 1991). F or e xample , we might tell ourselv es tha t our te am is talente d (internal), c onsis tently w orks
hard (s table), and uses eff ectiv e strategies (c ontrolla ble). In c ontras t, we are more lik ely to mak e external ,
unstable, and unc ontrolla ble a ttributions when our fa vorite te am loses . For e xample , we might tell ourselv es
that the other te am has more e xperienc ed pla yers or tha t the ref erees w ere unfair (e xternal), the other te am
played at home (uns table), and the c old w eather a ffecte d our te am’s performanc e (unc ontrolla ble).404 12 • Social P sycholog y

Just-W orld Hypothesis
One c onse quenc e of westerners’ tendency to pro vide disp ositional e xplana tions f or b ehavior is victim blame
(Jost & Major , 2001). When p eople e xperienc e bad fortune , others tend to as sume tha t the y someho w are
resp onsible f or their o wn fa te. A c ommon ideolog y, or w orldview , in the Unite d Sta tes is the jus t-world
hypothesis . The just-world h ypothesis is the b elief tha t people g et the outc omes the y deser ve (Lerner & Miller ,
1978). In order to maintain the b elief tha t the w orld is a fair plac e, people tend to think tha t good people
experienc e positiv e outc omes , and b ad p eople e xperienc e neg ative outc omes (J ost, Banaji , & N osek , 2004; J ost
& Major , 2001). The a bility to think o f the w orld as a fair plac e, where p eople g et wha t the y deser ve, allo ws us to
feel tha t the w orld is pre dicta ble and tha t we ha ve some c ontrol o ver our lif e outc omes (J ost et al ., 2004; J ost &
Major , 2001). F or e xample , if y ou w ant to e xperienc e positiv e outc omes , you jus t nee d to w ork hard to g et
ahead in lif e.
Can y ou think o f a neg ative conse quenc e of the jus t-world h ypothesis? One neg ative conse quenc e is p eople ’s
tendency to blame p oor individuals f or their plight . Wha t common e xplana tions are giv en f or wh y people liv e
in p overty? Ha ve you he ard s tatements such as , “The p oor are lazy and jus t don ’t want to w ork” or “P oor
people jus t want to liv e off the g overnment ”? Wha t typ es o f explana tions are these , disp ositional or situa tional?
These disp ositional e xplana tions are cle ar e xamples o f the fundamental a ttribution error . Blaming p oor p eople
for their p overty ignores situa tional factors tha t imp act them , such as high unemplo yment ra tes, rec ession ,
poor e ducational opp ortunities , and the familial cy cle o f poverty (Figure 12.7 ). Other rese arch sho ws tha t
people who hold jus t-world b eliefs ha ve neg ative attitudes to ward p eople who are unemplo yed and p eople
living with AIDS (Sut ton & Douglas , 2005). In the Unite d Sta tes and other c ountries , victims o f sexual as sault
may find themselv es blame d for their a buse . Victim adv ocacy groups , such as Domes tic V iolenc e Ende d
(DOVE), a ttend c ourt in supp ort of victims to ensure tha t blame is directe d at the p erpetra tors o f sexual
violenc e, not the victims .

As y ou’ve learne d, social ps ycholog y is the s tudy o f ho w people a ffect one another ’s thoughts , feelings , and
behaviors . We ha ve discus sed situa tional p ersp ectiv es and so cial ps ycholog y’s emphasis on the w ays in which
a person ’s en vironment , including culture and other so cial influenc es, affect b ehavior . In this section , we
examine situa tional f orces tha t ha ve a s trong influenc e on human b ehavior including so cial roles , social
norms , and scripts . We discus s ho w humans use the so cial en vironment as a sourc e of inf orma tion , or cues , on
how to b ehave. Situa tional influenc es on our b ehavior ha ve imp ortant c onse quenc es, such as whether w e will
help a s trang er in an emerg ency or ho w w e would b ehave in an unfamiliar en vironment .
Social R oles
One major so cial determinant o f human b ehavior is our so cial roles . Asocial role is a p attern o f behavior tha t
is expecte d of a p erson in a giv en set ting or group (Hare , 2003). Each one o f us has sev eral so cial roles . You
may be, at the same time , a s tudent , a p arent , an aspiring te acher , a son or da ughter , a sp ouse , and a lif eguard .
How do these so cial roles influenc e your b ehavior? So cial roles are define d by culturally share d kno wledge.
Tha t is, nearly ev eryone in a giv en culture kno ws wha t behavior is e xpecte d of a p erson in a giv en role . For
example , wha t is the so cial role f or a s tudent? If y ou lo ok around a c olleg e clas sroom y ou will lik ely see
students eng aging in s tudious b ehavior , taking notes , listening to the pro fessor, reading the te xtbook, and
sitting quietly a t their desks ( Figure 12.8 ). Of c ourse y ou ma y see s tudents devia ting from the e xpecte d
studious b ehavior such as te xting on their phones or using F acebook on their laptops , but in all c ases , the
students tha t you obser ve are a ttending clas s—a p art of the so cial role o f students .
FIGURE 12.8 Being a s tudent is jus t one o f the man y social r oles y ou ha ve. (credit: modification o f work b y “Rur al

Social roles , and our rela ted behavior , can v ary acros s diff erent set tings . Ho w do y ou b ehave when y ou are
engaging in the role o f a child a ttending a family function? N ow ima gine ho w you b ehave when y ou are
engaged in the role o f emplo yee a t your w orkplac e. It is v ery lik ely tha t your b ehavior will b e diff erent . Perhaps
you are more relax ed and out going with y our family , making jok es and doing silly things . But a t your w orkplac e
you might sp eak more pro fessionally , and although y ou ma y be friendly , you are also serious and f ocuse d on
getting the w ork c omplete d. These are e xamples o f ho w our so cial roles influenc e and o ften dicta te our
behavior to the e xtent tha t identity and p ersonality c an v ary with c onte xt (tha t is, in diff erent so cial groups)

Social Norms
As discus sed previously , social roles are define d by a culture ’s share d kno wledge of wha t is e xpecte d behavior
of an individual in a sp ecific role . This share d kno wledge comes from so cial norms . Asocial norm is a group ’s
expecta tion o f wha t is appropria te and ac cepta ble b ehavior f or its memb ers—ho w the y are supp osed to b ehave
and think (Deutsch & Gerard , 1955; Berk owitz, 2004). Ho w are w e expecte d to act? Wha t are w e expecte d to
talk a bout? Wha t are w e expecte d to w ear? In our discus sion o f social roles w e note d tha t colleg es ha ve so cial
norms f or students’ b ehavior in the role o f student and w orkplac es ha ve so cial norms f or emplo yees’ b ehaviors
in the role o f emplo yee. Social norms are ev erywhere including in families , gangs , and on so cial me dia outlets .
Wha t are some so cial norms on Ins tagram?
Tweens, T eens, and Social Norms
My 11- year-old daught er, Janel le, recently told me she needed shor ts and shir ts for the summer , and that she
wanted me t o tak e her t o a s tore at the mal l that is popular with pr eteens and t eens t o buy them. I ha ve notic ed that
man y girls ha ve clothes fr om that s tore, so I tried t easing her . I said, “ All the shir ts sa y ‘Aero’ on the fr ont. If y ou ar e
wearing a shir t like that and y ou ha ve a subs titut e teacher , and the other girls ar e all wearing that type o f shir t, won’t
the subs titut e teacher think y ou ar e all named ‘ Aero’?”
My daught er replied, in typical 11- year-old fashion, “Mom, y ou ar e not funn y. Can w e please g o shopping? ”
I tried a diff erent tactic. I ask ed Janel le if ha ving clothing fr om that par ticular s tore wil l mak e her popular . She
replied, “No , it wil l not mak e me popular . It is what the popular kids w ear. It wil l mak e me f eel happier .” Ho w can a
label or name br and mak e someone f eel happier? Think back t o what y ou’ve learned about lifespan de velopment .
What is it about pr e-teens and y oung t eens that mak e them w ant t o fit in ( Figure 12.9 )? Does this chang e over time?
Think back t o your high school e xperienc e, or look ar ound y our c ollege campus . What is the main name br and
clothing y ou see? What mes sages do w e get fr om the media about ho w to fit in?

Scripts
Because o f social roles , people tend to kno w wha t behavior is e xpecte d of them in sp ecific , familiar set tings . A
script is a p erson ’s kno wledge about the se quenc e of events e xpecte d in a sp ecific set ting (Schank & Ab elson ,
1977). Ho w do y ou act on the firs t day of scho ol, when y ou w alk into an elev ator, or are a t a res taurant? F or
example , at a res taurant in the Unite d Sta tes, if w e want the ser ver’s attention , we try to mak e eye contact . In
Brazil , you w ould mak e the sound “ps st” to g et the ser ver’s attention . You c an see the cultural diff erenc es in
scripts . To an Americ an, saying “ps st” to a ser ver might seem r ude , yet to a Brazilian , trying to mak e eye
contact might not seem an eff ectiv e strategy. Scripts are imp ortant sourc es o f inf orma tion to guide b ehavior in

Zimbar do’s Stanf ord Prison Experiment
The famous Stanf ord prison e xperiment , conducte d by so cial ps ychologis t Philip Zimb ardo and his
colleagues a t Stanf ord Univ ersity , demons trated the p ower o f social roles , social norms , and scripts . In the
summer o f 1971, an adv ertisement w as plac ed in a C alifornia new spaper asking f or male v olunteers to
particip ate in a s tudy a bout the ps ychologic al eff ects o f prison lif e. More than 70 men v olunteere d, and these
volunteers then under went ps ychologic al tes ting to elimina te candida tes who had underlying ps ychia tric
issues , me dical is sues , or a his tory of crime or dr ug a buse . The p ool of volunteers w as whit tled do wn to 24
health y male c olleg e students . Each s tudent w as p aid $15 p er da y (equiv alent to a bout $80 to day) and w as
randomly as signe d to pla y the role o f either a prisoner or a guard in the s tudy . Base d on wha t you ha ve learne d
about rese arch metho ds, wh y is it imp ortant tha t particip ants w ere randomly as signe d?
A mo ck prison w as c onstructe d in the b asement o f the ps ycholog y building a t Stanf ord. Particip ants as signe d
to pla y the role o f prisoners w ere “ arres ted” at their homes b y Palo A lto p olice officers, booked at a p olice
station , and subse quently tak en to the mo ck prison . The e xperiment w as sche dule d to r un f or sev eral w eeks .
To the surprise o f the rese archers , both the “prisoners” and “ guards” as sume d their roles with z eal. On the
second da y of the e xperiment , the guards f orced the prisoners to s trip, took their b eds, and isola ted the
ringle aders using solitar y confinement . In a rela tively shor t time , the guards c ame to haras s the prisoners in
an incre asingly sadis tic manner , through a c omplete lack o f priv acy, lack o f basic c omf orts such as ma ttres ses
to sleep on , and through degrading chores and la te-night c ounts .
The prisoners , in turn , began to sho w signs o f sev ere anxiety and hop eles snes s—the y began tolera ting the
guards’ a buse . Even the Stanf ord pro fessor who designe d the s tudy and w as the he ad rese archer , Philip
Zimb ardo , found himself acting as if the prison w as re al and his role , as prison sup ervisor , was re al as w ell.
After only six da ys, the e xperiment had to b e ende d due to the p articip ants’ deteriora ting b ehavior . Zimb ardo
explaine d,
At this p oint it b ecame cle ar tha t we had to end the s tudy . We had cre ated an o verwhelmingly p owerful
situa tion—a situa tion in which prisoners w ere withdra wing and b ehaving in p athologic al w ays, and in
which some o f the guards w ere b ehaving sadis tically. Even the “ good” guards f elt helples s to
inter vene, and none o f the guards quit while the s tudy w as in progres s. Indee d, it should b e note d tha t
no guard ev er came la te for his shift , called in sick , left e arly , or demande d extra p ay for o vertime
work. (Zimb ardo , 2013)
The Stanf ord P rison Exp eriment has b een use d as a memora ble demons tration o f the incre dible p ower tha t
social roles , norms , and scripts ha ve in a ffecting human b ehavior . Ho wever, multiple asp ects o f the s tudy ha ve
been subject to criticism sinc e its inc eption . The na ture o f these criticisms rang e from ethic al concerns to
issues o f generaliza bility (Bar tels, Milo vich , & Mous sier, 2016; Griggs , 2014; Le T exier , 2019). One criticism is
that the w ay students w ere recr uite d for the e xperiment ma y ha ve imp acte d the outc ome (C arnahan &
McF arland , 2007). Another criticism ques tions the c onclusions tha t can b e dra wn from the s tudy . Zimb ardo
app ears to ha ve pro vide d sp ecific guidelines o f the typ es o f behaviors tha t were e xpecte d of the guards
(Zimb ardo , 2007). Subse quent rese arch sugg ests tha t such guidelines lik ely cre ated an e xpecta tion o f the
types o f behavior tha t Zimb ardo rep orted obser ving in the Stanf ord P rison Exp eriment (Bar tels, 2019), and
that giv en these e xpecta tions , the guards simply acte d as the y thought the y were e xpecte d to act . It has also
been problema tic tha t attempts to replic ate asp ects o f the s tudy ha ve not b een suc cessful. For e xample , when
no guidelines w ere presente d to the guards , rese archers do cumente d diff erent outc omes than those obser ved
by Zimb ardo . (Reicher & Haslam , 2006).

12.3 Attitudes and P ersuasion
LEARNING OBJEC TIVES
By the end o f this section, y ou wil l be able t o:
•Define at titude
•Describe ho w people ’s attitudes ar e int ernal ly chang ed thr ough c ognitiv e dis sonanc e
•Explain ho w people ’s attitudes ar e external ly chang ed thr ough persuasion
•Describe the peripher al and c entr al routes to persuasion
Social ps ychologis ts ha ve do cumente d ho w the p ower o f the situa tion c an influenc e our b ehaviors . Now w e
turn to ho w the p ower o f the situa tion c an influenc e our a ttitudes and b eliefs .Attitude is our ev alua tion o f a
person , an ide a, or an object . We ha ve attitudes f or man y things ranging from pro ducts tha t we might pick up
in the sup ermark et to p eople around the w orld to p olitic al policies . Typic ally, attitudes are fa vorable or
unfa vorable: p ositiv e or neg ative (Ea gly & Chaik en, 1993). And , the y ha ve three c omp onents: an a ffectiv e
comp onent (f eelings), a b ehavioral c omp onent (the eff ect o f the a ttitude on b ehavior), and a c ognitiv e
comp onent ( belief and kno wledge) (R osenb erg & Ho vland , 1960).
For e xample , you ma y hold a p ositiv e attitude to ward recy cling . This a ttitude should result in p ositiv e feelings
toward recy cling (such as “It mak es me f eel g ood to recy cle” or “I enjo y kno wing tha t I mak e a small diff erenc e
in re ducing the amount o f waste tha t ends up in landfills”). C ertainly , this a ttitude should b e reflecte d in our
behavior: Y ou actually recy cle as o ften as y ou c an. Finally , this a ttitude will b e reflecte d in fa vorable thoughts
(for e xample , “Recycling is g ood for the en vironment ” or “R ecycling is the resp onsible thing to do ”).
Our a ttitudes and b eliefs are not only influenc ed by external f orces, but also b y internal influenc es tha t we
control . Lik e our b ehavior , our a ttitudes and thoughts are not alw ays chang ed by situa tional pres sures , but the y
can b e consciously chang ed by our o wn free will . In this section w e discus s the c onditions under which w e
would w ant to chang e our o wn a ttitudes and b eliefs .
What is Cognitive Dissonance?
Social ps ychologis ts ha ve do cumente d tha t feeling g ood about ourselv es and maintaining p ositiv e self -esteem
is a p owerful motiv ator o f human b ehavior ( Tavris & Aronson , 2008). In the Unite d Sta tes, memb ers o f the
predominant culture typic ally think v ery highly o f themselv es and view themselv es as g ood people who are
above average on man y desira ble traits (Ehrling er, Gilo vich , & R oss, 2005). Often , our b ehavior , attitudes , and
12.3 • A ttitudes and P ersuasion 409
beliefs are a ffecte d when w e experienc e a thre at to our self -esteem or p ositiv e self -ima ge. Psychologis t Leon
Festing er (1957) define dcognit ive dis sonanc eas ps ychologic al disc omf ort arising from holding tw o or more
inconsis tent a ttitudes , behaviors , or c ognitions (thoughts , beliefs , or opinions). F esting er’s theor y of cognitiv e
dissonanc e states tha t when w e experienc e a c onflict in our b ehaviors , attitudes , or b eliefs tha t runs c ounter to
our p ositiv e self -perceptions , we experienc e ps ychologic al disc omf ort (dis sonanc e). F or e xample , if y ou b eliev e
smoking is b ad for y our he alth but y ou c ontinue to smok e, you e xperienc e conflict b etween y our b elief and
behavior ( Figure 12.11 ).
FIGURE 12.11 Cognitiv e dis sonanc e is ar oused b y inc onsis tent beliefs and beha viors . Belie ving cig arettes ar e bad
for your heal th, but smoking cig arettes an yway, can cause c ognitiv e dis sonanc e. To reduc e cognitiv e dis sonanc e,
individuals can chang e their beha vior, as in quit ting smoking , or chang e their belief , such as disc ounting the
evidenc e that smoking is harmful . (credit “ cigarettes”: modification o f work b y CDC/Debor a Car tagena; “ patch”:
modification o f "RegBar c"/Wikimedia Commons; “ smoking ”: modification o f work b y Tim P arkinson)
Later rese arch do cumente d tha t only c onflicting c ognitions tha t thre aten individuals’ p ositiv e self -ima ge cause
dissonanc e (Green wald & R onis , 1978). A dditional rese arch f ound tha t dis sonanc e is not only ps ychologic ally
unc omf ortable but also c an c ause ph ysiologic al arousal (C royle & C ooper, 1983) and activ ate regions o f the
brain imp ortant in emotions and c ognitiv e functioning ( van V een, Krug, Scho oler , & C arter, 2009). When w e
experienc e cognitiv e dis sonanc e, we are motiv ated to decre ase it b ecause it is ps ychologic ally, physically, and410 12 • Social P sycholog y

mentally unc omf ortable. We can re ducecognitiv e dis sonanc eby bringing our c ognitions , attitudes , and
behaviors in line —tha t is, making them harmonious . This c an b e done in diff erent w ays, such as:
•changing our discrep ant b ehavior (e .g., stop smoking ),
•changing our c ognitions through ra tionaliza tion or denial (e .g., telling ourselv es tha t he alth risks c an b e
reduced by smoking filtere d cig aret tes),
•adding a new c ognition (e .g., “Smoking suppres ses m y app etite so I don ’t become o verweight , which is
good for m y he alth .”).
A clas sic e xample o f cognitiv e dis sonanc e is J oaquin , a 20- year-old who enlis ts in the militar y. During b oot
camp he is a wakened at 5:00 a.m ., is chronic ally sleep depriv ed, yelled at, covered in sand fle a bites , physically
bruise d and b attere d, and mentally e xhausted (Figure 12.12 ). It g ets w orse . Recruits tha t mak e it to w eek 11 o f
boot camp ha ve to do 54 hours o f continuous training .
FIGURE 12.12 A person who has chosen a difficul t path mus t deal with c ognitiv e dis sonanc e in addition t o man y
other disc omforts. (credit: T yler J . Bolk en)
Not surprisingly , Joaquin is misera ble. No one lik es to b e misera ble. In this typ e of situa tion , people c an
chang e their b eliefs , their a ttitudes , or their b ehaviors . The las t option , a chang e of behaviors , is not a vailable
to Joaquin . He has signe d on to the militar y for four y ears, and he c annot leg ally le ave.
If Joaquin k eeps thinking a bout ho w misera ble he is , it is g oing to b e a v ery long f our y ears. He will b e in a
constant s tate of cognitiv e dis sonanc e. As an alterna tive to this miser y, Joaquin c an chang e his b eliefs or
attitudes . He c an tell himself, “I am b ecoming s trong er, healthier , and sharp er. I am le arning discipline and
how to def end m yself and m y countr y. Wha t I am doing is re ally imp ortant .” If this is his b elief, he will re alize
that he is b ecoming s trong er through his challeng es. He then will f eel b etter and not e xperienc e cognitiv e
dissonanc e, which is an unc omf ortable s tate.
The Eff ect of Initiation
The militar y example demons trates the obser vation tha t a difficult initia tion into a group influenc es us to lik e
the group more . Another so cial ps ycholog y concept,justification of eff ort, sugg ests tha t we value g oals and
achiev ements tha t we put a lot o f eff ort into . According to this theor y, if something is difficult f or us to achiev e,
we believ e it is more w orthwhile . For e xample , if y ou mo ve to an ap artment and sp end hours as sembling a
dres ser y ou b ought from Ik ea, you will v alue tha t more than a fancier dres ser someone else b ought y ou. We do
not w ant to ha ve wasted time and eff ort to join a group tha t we ev entually le ave. A clas sic e xperiment b y
Aronson and Mills (1959) demons trated this jus tific ation o f eff ort eff ect. Colleg e students v olunteere d to join a
campus group tha t would meet regularly to discus s the ps ycholog y of sex. Particip ants w ere randomly
assigne d to one o f three c onditions: no initia tion , an e asy initia tion , and a difficult initia tion into the group .
After p articip ating in the firs t discus sion , which w as delib erately made v ery boring , particip ants ra ted ho w
much the y lik ed the group . Particip ants who under went a difficult initia tion pro cess to join the group ra ted the
group more fa vorably than did p articip ants with an e asy initia tion or no initia tion ( Figure 12.13 ).12.3 • A ttitudes and P ersuasion 411
FIGURE 12.13 Justification o f effort has a dis tinct eff ect on a person liking a gr oup. Students in the difficul t
initiation c ondition lik ed the gr oup mor e than s tudents in other c onditions due t o the jus tification o f effort.
Similar eff ects c an b e seen in a more rec ent s tudy o f ho w student eff ort affects c ourse ev alua tions . Heck ert,
Latier, Ring wald-B urton, and Draz en (2006) sur veyed 463 undergradua tes enrolle d in c ourses a t a midw estern
univ ersity a bout the amount o f eff ort tha t their c ourses re quire d of them . In addition , the s tudents w ere also
asked to ev alua te various asp ects o f the c ourse . Giv en wha t you’ve jus t read, it will c ome as no surprise tha t
those c ourses tha t were as sociated with the highes t lev el of eff ort were ev alua ted as b eing more v alua ble than
those tha t did not . Furthermore , students indic ated tha t the y learne d more in c ourses tha t require d more
effort, reg ardles s of the grades tha t the y rec eived in those c ourses (Heck ert et al ., 2006).
Besides the clas sic militar y example and group initia tion , can y ou think o f other e xamples o fcognitiv e
dissonanc e? Here is one: Maria and Marc o liv e in F airfield C ounty , Connecticut , which is one o f the w ealthies t
areas in the Unite d Sta tes and has a v ery high c ost of living . Maria telec ommutes from home and Marc o do es
not w ork outside o f the home . The y rent a v ery small house f or more than $3000 a month . Marc o shops a t
consignment s tores f or clothes and ec onomiz es when p ossible . The y complain tha t the y nev er ha ve an y mone y
and tha t the y cannot buy an ything new . When ask ed wh y the y do not mo ve to a les s expensiv e location , sinc e
Maria telec ommutes , the y resp ond tha t Fairfield C ounty is b eautiful , the y love the b eaches , and the y feel
comf ortable there . Ho w do es the theor y of cognitiv e dis sonanc e apply to Maria and Marc o’s choic es?
Persuasion
In the previous section w e discus sed tha t the motiv ation to re duce cognitiv e dis sonanc e leads us to chang e our
attitudes , behaviors , and/or c ognitions to mak e them c onsonant .Persuasion is the pro cess of changing our
attitude to ward something b ased on some kind o f communic ation . Much o f the p ersuasion w e experienc e
comes from outside f orces. Ho w do p eople c onvinc e others to chang e their a ttitudes , beliefs , and b ehaviors
(Figure 12.14 )? Wha t communic ations do y ou rec eive tha t attempt to p ersuade y ou to chang e your a ttitudes ,
beliefs , and b ehaviors?412 12 • Social P sycholog y

A subfield o f social ps ycholog y studies p ersuasion and so cial influenc e, pro viding us with a plethora o f
informa tion on ho w humans c an b e persuade d by others .
Yale Attitude Change Appr oach
The topic o f persuasion has b een one o f the mos t extensiv ely rese arche d are as in so cial ps ycholog y (Fiske et
al., 2010). During the Sec ond W orld W ar, CarlHovland extensiv ely rese arche d persuasion f or the U .S. Arm y.
After the w ar, Ho vland c ontinue d his e xplora tion o f persuasion a t Yale Univ ersity . Out o f this w ork c ame a
model c alled the Yale a ttitude chang e appro ach, which describ es the c onditions under which p eople tend to
chang e their a ttitudes . Ho vland demons trated tha t certain f eatures o f the sourc e of a p ersuasiv e mes sage, the
content o f the mes sage, and the characteris tics o f the a udienc e will influenc e the p ersuasiv enes s of a mes sage
(Hovland , Janis , & K elley, 1953).
Features o f the sourc e of the p ersuasiv e mes sage include the cre dibility o f the sp eaker (Ho vland & W eiss,
1951) and the ph ysical attractiv enes s of the sp eaker (Ea gly & Chaik en, 1975; P etty, Wegener , & F abrig ar, 1997).
Thus , speakers who are cre dible , or ha ve expertise on the topic , and who are deeme d as tr ustworthy are more
persuasiv e than les s cre dible sp eakers. Similarly , more a ttractiv e sp eakers are more p ersuasiv e than les s
attractiv e sp eakers. The use o f famous actors and a thletes to adv ertise pro ducts on television and in print
relies on this principle . The imme diate and long term imp act o f the p ersuasion also dep ends , however, on the
credibility o f the mes seng er (K umkale & A lbarracín , 2004).
Features o f the mes sage itself tha t affect p ersuasion include subtlety (the quality o f being imp ortant , but not
obvious) (P etty & C aciopp o, 1986; W alster & F esting er, 1962); side dnes s (tha t is, having more than one side)
(Crowley & Ho yer, 1994; Ig ou & Bles s, 2003; L umsdaine & J anis , 1953); timing (Ha ugtv edt & W egener , 1994;
Miller & C ampb ell, 1959), and whether b oth sides are presente d. Mes sages tha t are more subtle are more
persuasiv e than direct mes sages. Arguments tha t occur firs t, such as in a deb ate, are more influential if
mes sages are giv en b ack-to-back. Ho wever, if there is a dela y after the firs t mes sage, and b efore the a udienc e
needs to mak e a decision , the las t mes sage presente d will tend to b e more p ersuasiv e (Miller & C ampb ell,
1959).
Features o f the a udienc e tha t affect p ersuasion are a ttention (A lbarracín & W yer, 2001; F esting er & Mac coby,
1964), intellig ence, self -esteem (Rho des & W ood, 1992), and a ge (K rosnick & A lwin , 1989). In order to b e
persuade d, audienc e memb ers mus t be paying a ttention . People with lo wer intellig ence are more e asily
persuade d than p eople with higher intellig ence; where as p eople with mo dera te self -esteem are more e asily
persuade d than p eople with higher or lo wer self -esteem (Rho des & W ood, 1992). F inally , young er adults a ged
18–25 are more p ersuada ble than older adults .12.3 • A ttitudes and P ersuasion 413
Elabor ation Lik elihood Model
An esp ecially p opular mo del tha t describ es the dynamics o f persuasion is the ela boration lik eliho od mo del o f
persuasion (P etty & C aciopp o, 1986). The elaboration lik eliho od mo delconsiders the v aria bles o f the a ttitude
chang e appro ach—tha t is, features o f the sourc e of the p ersuasiv e mes sage, contents o f the mes sage, and
characteris tics o f the a udienc e are use d to determine when a ttitude chang e will o ccur. According to the
elaboration lik eliho od mo del o f persuasion , there are tw o main routes tha t pla y a role in deliv ering a
persuasiv e mes sage: central and p eripheral ( Figure 12.15 ).
FIGURE 12.15 Persuasion can tak e one o f two paths , and the dur ability o f the end r esul t depends on the path.
The central route is logic driv en and uses da ta and facts to c onvinc e people o f an argument ’s worthines s. For
example , a c ar comp any seeking to p ersuade y ou to purchase their mo del will emphasiz e the c ar’s sa fety
features and fuel ec onom y. This is a direct route to p ersuasion tha t focuses on the quality o f the inf orma tion . In
order f or the c entral route o f persuasion to b e eff ectiv e in changing a ttitudes , thoughts , and b ehaviors , the
argument mus t be strong and , if suc cessful, will result in las ting a ttitude chang e.
The c entral route to p ersuasion w orks b est when the targ et of persuasion , or the a udienc e, is analytic al and
willing to eng age in pro cessing o f the inf orma tion . From an adv ertiser ’s persp ectiv e, wha t pro ducts w ould b e
best sold using the c entral route to p ersuasion? Wha t audienc e would mos t lik ely b e influenc ed to buy the
product? One e xample is buying a c omputer . It is lik ely, for e xample , tha t small busines s owners might b e
especially influenc ed by the f ocus on the c omputer ’s quality and f eatures such as pro cessing sp eed and
memor y capacity .
The peripheral route is an indirect route tha t uses p eripheral cues to as sociate p ositivity with the mes sage
(Petty & C aciopp o, 1986). Ins tead o f focusing on the facts and a pro duct ’s quality , the p eripheral route relies on
association with p ositiv e characteris tics such as p ositiv e emotions and c elebrity endorsement . For e xample ,
having a p opular a thlete adv ertise a thletic sho es is a c ommon metho d use d to enc oura ge young adults to
purchase the sho es. This route to a ttitude chang e do es not re quire much eff ort or inf orma tion pro cessing . This
metho d of persuasion ma y promote p ositivity to ward the mes sage or pro duct , but it typic ally results in les s
permanent a ttitude or b ehavior chang e. The a udienc e do es not nee d to b e analytic al or motiv ated to pro cess
the mes sage. In fact , a p eripheral route to p ersuasion ma y not ev en b e notic ed by the a udienc e, for e xample in
the s trategy of pro duct plac ement . Product plac ement ref ers to put ting a pro duct with a cle ar brand name or
brand identity in a T V sho w or mo vie to promote the pro duct (Gupta & Lord , 1998). F or e xample , one se ason o f
the re ality series Americ an Idol prominently sho wed the p anel o f judg es drinking out o f cups tha t displa yed
the C oca-Cola log o. Wha t other pro ducts w ould b e best sold using the p eripheral route to p ersuasion? Another
example is clothing: A retailer ma y focus on c elebrities tha t are w earing the same s tyle o f clothing .

people ’s attitude , ide as, and b ehaviors . One eff ectiv e strategy is the f oot-in-the -door technique (Cialdini , 2001;
Pliner , Har t, Kohl, & Saari , 1974). U sing the foot-in-the -door technique , the p ersuader g ets a p erson to a gree
to b estow a small fa vor or to buy a small item , only to la ter re ques t a larg er fa vor or purchase o f a bigg er item .
The f oot-in-the -door technique w as demons trated in a s tudy b y Freedman and F raser (1966) in which
particip ants who a gree d to a p ost small sign in their y ard or sign a p etition w ere more lik ely to a gree to put a
larg e sign in their y ard than p eople who decline d the firs t reques t (Figure 12.16 ). Research on this technique
also illus trates the principle o f consis tency (Cialdini , 2001): Our p ast behavior o ften directs our future
behavior , and w e ha ve a desire to maintain c onsis tency onc e we ha ve commit ted to a b ehavior .
FIGURE 12.16 With the f oot-in-the -door t echnique , getting someone t o agr ee to a smal l reques t such as (a)

A common applic ation o f foot-in-the -door is when teens ask their p arents f or a small p ermis sion (f or e xample ,
extending cur few b y a half hour) and then asking them f or something larg er. Ha ving grante d the smaller
reques t incre ases the lik eliho od tha t parents will ac quiesc e with the la ter, larg er re ques t.
How w ould a s tore o wner use the f oot-in-the -door technique to sell y ou an e xpensiv e pro duct? F or e xample ,
say tha t you are buying the la test mo del smar tphone , and the salesp erson sugg ests you purchase the b est data
plan . You a gree to this . The salesp erson then sugg ests a bigg er purchase —the three -year e xtende d warranty .
After a greeing to the smaller re ques t, you are more lik ely to also a gree to the larg er re ques t. You ma y ha ve
encountere d this if y ou ha ve bought a c ar. When salesp eople re alize tha t a buy er intends to purchase a c ertain
model, the y might tr y to g et the cus tomer to p ay for man y or mos t available options on the c ar. Another

In this section , we discus s additional w ays in which p eople influenc e others . The topics o f conformity , social
influenc e, obedienc e, and group pro cesses demons trate the p ower o f the so cial situa tion to chang e our
thoughts , feelings , and b ehaviors . We begin this section with a discus sion o f a famous so cial ps ycholog y
experiment tha t demons trated ho w susc eptible humans are to outside so cial pres sures .12.4 • Conf ormity , Complianc e, and Obedienc e415
Conf ormity
Solomon Asch conducte d sev eral e xperiments in the 1950s to determine ho w people are a ffecte d by the
thoughts and b ehaviors o f other p eople . In one s tudy , a group o f particip ants w as sho wn a series o f printe d line
segments o f diff erent lengths: a, b , and c ( Figure 12.17 ). Particip ants w ere then sho wn a f ourth line segment: x .
The y were ask ed to identif y which line segment from the firs t group (a, b , or c) mos t closely resemble d the
fourth line segment in length .
FIGURE 12.17 These line segments il lustrate the judgment task in Asch ’s conformity s tudy . Which line on the
right —a, b, or c—is the same length as line x on the left?
Each group o f particip ants had only one tr ue, naïv e subject . The remaining memb ers o f the group w ere
confedera tes o f the rese archer . Aconfederate is a p erson who is a ware o f the e xperiment and w orks f or the
rese archer . Confedera tes are use d to manipula te so cial situa tions as p art of the rese arch design , and the tr ue,
naïv e particip ants b eliev e tha t confedera tes are , like them , uninf orme d particip ants in the e xperiment . In
Asch ’s study , the c onfedera tes identifie d a line segment tha t was ob viously shor ter than the targ et line —a
wrong ans wer. The naïv e particip ant then had to identif y aloud the line segment tha t best ma tche d the targ et
line segment .
How often do y ou think the tr ue p articip ant aligne d with the c onfedera tes’ resp onse? Tha t is, how often do y ou
think the group influenc ed the p articip ant, and the p articip ant g ave the wrong ans wer? Asch (1955) f ound tha t
76% o f particip ants c onforme d to group pres sure a t least onc e by indic ating the inc orrect line .Conformit yis
the chang e in a p erson ’s behavior to g o along with the group , even if he do es not a gree with the group . Wh y
would p eople giv e the wrong ans wer? Wha t factors w ould incre ase or decre ase someone giving in or
conforming to group pres sure?
The Asch eff ectis the influenc e of the group majority on an individual ’s judgment .
Wha t factors mak e a p erson more lik ely to yield to group pres sure? R esearch sho ws tha t the siz e of the
majority , the presenc e of another dis senter , and the public or rela tively priv ate na ture o f resp onses are k ey
influenc es on c onformity .
•The siz e of the majority: The gre ater the numb er o f people in the majority , the more lik ely an individual
will c onform . There is , however, an upp er limit: a p oint where adding more memb ers do es not incre ase
conformity . In Asch ’s study , conformity incre ased with the numb er o f people in the majority —up to sev en
individuals . At numb ers b eyond sev en, conformity lev eled off and decre ased slightly (Asch , 1955).
•The presenc e of another dis senter: If there is a t least one dis senter , conformity ra tes drop to ne ar zero
(Asch , 1955).
•The public or priv ate na ture o f the resp onses: When resp onses are made publicly (in front o f others),
conformity is more lik ely; ho wever, when resp onses are made priv ately (e .g., writing do wn the resp onse),
conformity is les s lik ely (Deutsch & Gerard , 1955).
The finding tha t conformity is more lik ely to o ccur when resp onses are public than when the y are priv ate is the416 12 • Social P sycholog y

reason g overnment elections re quire v oting in secret , so w e are not c oerced by others ( Figure 12.18 ). The Asch
effectcan b e easily seen in children when the y ha ve to publicly v ote f or something . For e xample , if the te acher
asks whether the children w ould ra ther ha ve extra rec ess, no homew ork, or c andy , onc e a f ew children v ote,
the res t will c omply and g o with the majority . In a diff erent clas sroom, the majority might v ote diff erently , and
mos t of the children w ould c omply with tha t majority . When someone ’s vote chang es if it is made in public
versus priv ate, this is kno wn as c omplianc e. Complianc e can b e a f orm o f conformity . Complianc e is g oing
along with a re ques t or demand , even if y ou do not a gree with the re ques t. In Asch ’s studies , the p articip ants
complie d by giving the wrong ans wers, but priv ately did not ac cept tha t the ob vious wrong ans wers w ere
correct .

Now tha t you ha ve learne d about the Asch line e xperiments , wh y do y ou think the p articip ants c onforme d?
The c orrect ans wer to the line segment ques tion w as ob vious , and it w as an e asy task . Researchers ha ve
categoriz ed the motiv ation to c onform into tw o typ es: norma tive so cial influenc e and inf orma tional so cial
influenc e (Deutsch & Gerard , 1955).
Innormat ive so cial influenc e, people c onform to the group norm to fit in , to f eel g ood, and to b e ac cepte d by
the group . Ho wever, with informat ional so cial influenc e, people c onform b ecause the y believ e the group is
comp etent and has the c orrect inf orma tion , particularly when the task or situa tion is ambiguous . Wha t typ e of
social influenc e was op erating in the Asch c onformity s tudies? Sinc e the line judgment task w as unambiguous ,
particip ants did not nee d to rely on the group f or inf orma tion . Ins tead, particip ants c omplie d to fit in and
avoid ridicule , an ins tanc e of norma tive so cial influenc e.
An e xample o f inf orma tional so cial influenc e ma y be wha t to do in an emerg ency situa tion . Ima gine tha t you
are in a mo vie the ater w atching a film and wha t seems to b e smok e comes in the the ater from under the
emerg ency e xit do or. You are not c ertain tha t it is smok e—it might b e a sp ecial eff ect f or the mo vie, such as a
fog machine . When y ou are unc ertain y ou will tend to lo ok a t the b ehavior o f others in the the ater. If other
people sho w concern and g et up to le ave, you are lik ely to do the same . Ho wever, if others seem unc oncerne d,
you are lik ely to s tay put and c ontinue w atching the mo vie ( Figure 12.19 ).12.4 • Conf ormity , Complianc e, and Obedienc e417

How w ould y ou ha ve behaved if y ou w ere a p articip ant in Asch ’s study? Man y students sa y the y would not
conform , tha t the s tudy is outda ted, and tha t people no wadays are more indep endent . To some e xtent this ma y
be true. Research sugg ests tha t overall ra tes o f conformity ma y ha ve re duced sinc e the time o f Asch ’s rese arch .
Furthermore , efforts to replic ate Asch ’s study ha ve made it cle ar tha t man y factors determine ho w lik ely it is
that someone will demons trate conformity to the group . These factors include the p articip ant’s age, gender ,
and so cio-cultural b ackground (Bond & Smith , 1996; Larsen , 1990; W alker & Andrade , 1996).

Stanley Milgr am’ s Experiment
Conformity is one eff ect o f the influenc e of others on our thoughts , feelings , and b ehaviors . Another f orm o f
social influenc e is ob edienc e to a uthority .Obedienc eis the chang e of an individual ’s behavior to c omply with a
demand b y an a uthority figure . People o ften c omply with the re ques t because the y are c oncerne d about a
conse quenc e if the y do not c omply . To demons trate this phenomenon , we review another clas sic so cial
psycholog y experiment .
Stanle yMilgram was a so cial ps ycholog y pro fessor a t Yale who w as influenc ed by the trial o f Adolf Eichmann , a
Nazi w ar criminal . Eichmann ’s def ense f or the a trocities he c ommit ted was tha t he w as “jus t following orders .”
Milgram (1963) w ante d to tes t the v alidity o f this def ense , so he designe d an e xperiment and initially recr uite d
40 men f or his e xperiment . The v olunteer p articip ants w ere le d to b eliev e tha t the y were p articip ating in a
study to impro ve learning and memor y. The p articip ants w ere told tha t the y were to te ach other s tudents
(learners) c orrect ans wers to a series o f tes t items . The p articip ants w ere sho wn ho w to use a devic e tha t the y
were told deliv ered electric sho cks o f diff erent intensities to the le arners . The p articip ants w ere told to sho ck
the le arners if the y gave a wrong ans wer to a tes t item—tha t the sho ck w ould help them to le arn. The
particip ants b eliev ed the y gave the le arners sho cks, which incre ased in 15- volt increments , all the w ay up to
450 v olts. The p articip ants did not kno w tha t the le arners w ere c onfedera tes and tha t the c onfedera tes did not
actually rec eive sho cks.
In resp onse to a s tring o f inc orrect ans wers from the le arners , the p articip ants ob ediently and rep eatedly
shocked them . The c onfedera te le arners crie d out f or help , begged the p articip ant te achers to s top, and ev en
complaine d of he art trouble . Yet, when the rese archer told the p articip ant-teachers to c ontinue the sho ck, 65%
of the p articip ants c ontinue d the sho ck to the maximum v olta ge and to the p oint tha t the le arner b ecame
unresp onsiv e (Figure 12.20 ). Wha t mak es someone ob ey authority to the p oint o f potentially c ausing serious
harm to another p erson?

Several v aria tions o f the original Milgram experiment w ere c onducte d to tes t the b oundaries o f ob edienc e.
When c ertain f eatures o f the situa tion w ere chang ed, particip ants w ere les s lik ely to c ontinue to deliv er sho cks
(Milgram , 1965). F or e xample , when the set ting o f the e xperiment w as mo ved to an o ff-campus o ffice building ,
the p ercenta ge of particip ants who deliv ered the highes t sho ck dropp ed to 48%. When the le arner w as in the
same ro om as the te acher , the highes t sho ck ra te dropp ed to 40%. When the te achers’ and le arners’ hands
were touching , the highes t sho ck ra te dropp ed to 30%. When the rese archer g ave the orders b y phone , the ra te
dropp ed to 23%. These v aria tions sho w tha t when the humanity o f the p erson b eing sho cked was incre ased,
obedienc e decre ased. Similarly , when the a uthority o f the e xperimenter decre ased, so did ob edienc e.
This c ase is s till v ery applic able to day. Wha t do es a p erson do if an a uthority figure orders something done?
Wha t if the p erson b eliev es it is inc orrect , or w orse , unethic al? In a s tudy b y Mar tin and B ull (2008), midwiv es
priv ately fille d out a ques tionnaire reg arding b est practic es and e xpecta tions in deliv ering a b aby. Then , a
more senior midwif e and sup ervisor ask ed the junior midwiv es to do something the y had previously s tated
they were opp osed to. Mos t of the junior midwiv es w ere ob edient to a uthority , going a gains t their o wn b eliefs .
Burger (2009) p artially replic ated this s tudy . He f ound among a multicultural sample o f women and men tha t

Burger's work in P oland and c ontrolle d for the g ender o f both p articip ants and le arners , and onc e again,
results tha t were c onsis tent with Milgram 's original w ork w ere obser ved.
Groupthink
When in group set tings , we are o ften influenc ed by the thoughts , feelings , and b ehaviors o f people around us .
Whether it is due to norma tive or inf orma tional so cial influenc e, groups ha ve power to influenc e individuals .
Another phenomenon o f group c onformity is groupthink .Groupthink is the mo dific ation o f the opinions o f
memb ers o f a group to align with wha t the y believ e is the group c onsensus (J anis , 1972). In group situa tions ,
the group o ften tak es action tha t individuals w ould not p erform outside the group set ting b ecause groups
mak e more e xtreme decisions than individuals do . Moreo ver, groupthink c an hinder opp osing trains o f
thought . This elimina tion o f div erse opinions c ontributes to fa ulty decision b y the group .
Groupthink in the U.S. Go vernment
Ther e ha ve been se veral ins tanc es o f groupthink in the U .S. g overnment. One e xample oc curr ed when the Unit edDIG DEEPER12.4 • Conf ormity , Complianc e, and Obedienc e419
Stat es led a smal l coalition o f nations t o invade Ir aq in Mar ch 2003. This in vasion oc curr ed because a smal l
group o f advisors and f ormer P resident Geor ge W. Bush w ere convinc ed that Ir aq represent ed a significant
terrorism thr eat with a lar ge stockpile o f weapons o f mas s des truction at its disposal . Although some o f these
individuals ma y ha ve had some doub ts about the cr edibility o f the inf ormation a vailable t o them at the time , in
the end, the gr oup arriv ed at a c onsensus that Ir aq had w eapons o f mas s des truction and r epresent ed a
significant thr eat t o national security . It lat er came t o light that Ir aq did not ha ve weapons o f mas s des truction,
but not until the in vasion w as w ell under way. As a r esul t, 6000 American soldiers w ere kil led and man y mor e
civilians died. Ho w did the Bush adminis tration arriv e at their c onclusions? Vie w this video o f Colin P owell, 10
years aft er his famous Unit ed Nations speech, discus sing the inf ormation he had at the time
(https:/ /www .opens tax.org/l/Gr oupThink) that his decisions w ere based on. (" CNN Official Int erview: Colin
Powell now regrets UN speech about WMDs ," 2010).
Do y ou see e videnc e of groupthink?
Why do es groupthink o ccur? There are sev eral c auses o f groupthink , which mak es it prev enta ble. When the
group is highly c ohesiv e, or has a s trong sense o f connection , maintaining group harmon y ma y become more
imp ortant to the group than making sound decisions . If the group le ader is directiv e and mak es his opinions
kno wn, this ma y disc oura ge group memb ers from disa greeing with the le ader . If the group is isola ted from
hearing alterna tive or new viewp oints , groupthink ma y be more lik ely. Ho w do y ou kno w when groupthink is
occurring?
There are sev eral s ymptoms o f groupthink including the f ollowing:
•perceiving the group as in vulnera ble or in vincible —believing it c an do no wrong
•believing the group is morally c orrect
•self-censorship b y group memb ers, such as withholding inf orma tion to a void disr upting the group
consensus
•the quashing o f dis senting group memb ers’ opinions
•the shielding o f the group le ader from dis senting view s
•perceiving an illusion o f unanimity among group memb ers
•holding s tereotyp es or neg ative attitudes to ward the out -group or others’ with diff ering viewp oints (J anis ,
1972)
Given the c auses and s ymptoms o f groupthink , how can it b e avoide d? There are sev eral s trategies tha t can
impro ve group decision making including seeking outside opinions , voting in priv ate, having the le ader
withhold p osition s tatements until all group memb ers ha ve voiced their view s, conducting rese arch on all
viewp oints , weighing the c osts and b enefits o f all options , and dev eloping a c onting ency plan (J anis , 1972;
Mitchell & E ckstein , 2009).
Group P olariz ation
Another phenomenon tha t occurs within group set tings is group p olariza tion .Group p olarizat ion (Teger &
Pruitt, 1967) is the s trengthening o f an original group a ttitude a fter the discus sion o f view s within a group .
Tha t is, if a group initially fa vors a viewp oint , after discus sion the group c onsensus is lik ely a s trong er
endorsement o f the viewp oint . Conversely , if the group w as initially opp osed to a viewp oint , group discus sion
would lik ely le ad to s trong er opp osition . Group p olariza tion e xplains man y actions tak en b y groups tha t would
not b e under taken b y individuals . Group p olariza tion c an b e obser ved at politic al conventions , when pla tforms
of the p arty are supp orted by individuals who , when not in a group , would decline to supp ort them . Recently ,
some theoris ts ha ve argue d tha t group p olariza tion ma y be partly resp onsible f or the e xtreme p olitic al
partisanship tha t seems ubiquitous in mo dern so ciety . Giv en tha t people c an self -select me dia outlets tha t are
mos t consis tent with their o wn p olitic al view s, the y are les s lik ely to enc ounter opp osing viewp oints . Over
time , this le ads to a s trengthening o f their o wn p ersp ectiv e and o f hos tile a ttitudes and b ehaviors to wards420 12 • Social P sycholog y
Access for fr ee a t opens tax. org
those with diff erent p olitic al ide als. Remarka bly, politic al polariza tion le ads to op en lev els o f discrimina tion
that are on p ar with , or p erhaps e xceed, racial discrimina tion (Iy engar & W estwood, 2015). A more ev eryday
example is a group ’s discus sion o f ho w attractiv e someone is . Do es y our opinion chang e if y ou find someone
attractiv e, but y our friends do not a gree? If y our friends v ociferously a gree , might y ou then find this p erson
even more a ttractiv e?
Social traps ref er to situa tions tha t arise when individuals or groups o f individuals b ehave in w ays tha t are not
in their b est interes t and tha t ma y ha ve neg ative, long-term c onse quenc es. Ho wever, onc e es tablishe d, a so cial
trap is v ery difficult to esc ape. For e xample , following W orld W ar II, the Unite d Sta tes and the f ormer So viet
Union eng aged in a nucle ar arms rac e. While the presenc e of nucle ar w eapons is not in either p arty's best
interes t, onc e the arms rac e began, each c ountr y felt the nee d to c ontinue pro ducing nucle ar w eapons to
protect itself from the other .
Social Loafing
Ima gine y ou w ere jus t assigne d a group project with other s tudents whom y ou b arely kno w. Everyone in y our
group will g et the same grade . Are y ou the typ e who will do mos t of the w ork, even though the final grade will
be share d? Or are y ou more lik ely to do les s work b ecause y ou kno w others will pick up the slack? Social
loafing involves a re duction in individual output on tasks where c ontributions are p ooled. Bec ause e ach
individual's eff orts are not ev alua ted, individuals c an b ecome les s motiv ated to p erform w ell. Karau and
Williams (1993) and Simms and Nichols (2014) review ed the rese arch on so cial lo afing and disc erne d when it
was le ast lik ely to happ en. The rese archers note d tha t social lo afing c ould b e allevia ted if, among other
situa tions , individuals knew their w ork w ould b e as sessed by a mana ger (in a w orkplac e set ting ) or ins tructor
(in a clas sroom set ting ), or if a mana ger or ins tructor re quire d group memb ers to c omplete self -evalua tions .
The lik eliho od of social lo afing in s tudent w ork groups incre ases as the siz e of the group incre ases (Shepp erd &
Taylor , 1999). A ccording to K ama u and W illiams (1993), c olleg e students w ere the p opula tion mos t lik ely to
engage in so cial lo afing . Their s tudy also f ound tha t women and p articip ants from c ollectivis tic cultures w ere
less lik ely to eng age in so cial lo afing , explaining tha t their group orienta tion ma y ac count f or this .
Colleg e students c ould w ork around so cial lo afing or “free -riding ” by sugg esting to their pro fessors use o f a
flocking metho d to f orm groups . Harding (2018) c omp ared groups o f students who had self -selecte d into
groups f or clas s to those who had b een f orme d by flo cking , which in volves as signing s tudents to groups who
have similar sche dules and motiv ations . Not only did she find tha t students rep orted les s “free riding ,” but tha t
they also did b etter in the group as signments c omp ared to those whose groups w ere self -selecte d.
Interes tingly , the opp osite o f social lo afing o ccurs when the task is c omple x and difficult (Bond & Titus , 1983;
Geen , 1989). In a group set ting , such as the s tudent w ork group , if y our individual p erformanc e cannot b e
evalua ted, there is les s pres sure f or y ou to do w ell, and thus les s anxiety or ph ysiologic al arousal (La tané ,
Williams , & Hark ens, 1979). This puts y ou in a relax ed state in which y ou c an p erform y our b est, if y ou cho ose
(Zajonc , 1965). If the task is a difficult one , man y people f eel motiv ated and b eliev e tha t their group nee ds their
input to do w ell on a challenging project (J ackson & W illiams , 1985).
Deindividuation
Another w ay tha t being p art of a group c an a ffect b ehavior is e xhibite d in ins tanc es in which deindividua tion
occurs . Deindividua tion ref ers to situa tions in which a p erson ma y feel a sense o f anon ymity and theref ore a
reduction in ac counta bility and sense o f self when among others . Deindividua tion is o ften p ointe d to in c ases
in which mob or riot -like behaviors o ccur (Zimb ardo , 1969), but rese arch on the subject and the role tha t
deindividua tion pla ys in such b ehaviors has resulte d in inc onsis tent results (as discus sed in Grans tröm , Guv å,
Hylander , & R osander , 2009).

Understanding Pr ejudice and Discrimination
As w e discus sed in the op ening s tory of Trayvon Mar tin, humans are v ery div erse and although w e share man y
similarities , we also ha ve man y diff erenc es. The so cial groups w e belong to help f orm our identities ( Tajfel,
1974). These diff erenc es ma y be difficult f or some p eople to rec oncile , which ma y lead to prejudic e toward
people who are diff erent .Prejudic eis a neg ative attitude and f eeling to ward an individual b ased solely on
one’s memb ership in a p articular so cial group (A llport, 1954; Bro wn, 2010). P rejudic e is c ommon a gains t
people who are memb ers o f an unfamiliar cultural group . Thus , certain typ es o f educ ation , contact ,
interactions , and building rela tionships with memb ers o f diff erent cultural groups c an re duce the tendency
toward prejudic e. In fact , simply ima gining interacting with memb ers o f diff erent cultural groups might a ffect
prejudic e. Indee d, when e xperimental p articip ants w ere ask ed to ima gine themselv es p ositiv ely interacting
with someone from a diff erent group , this le d to an incre ased positiv e attitude to ward the other group and an
incre ase in p ositiv e traits as sociated with the other group . Furthermore , ima gine d so cial interaction c an
reduce anxiety as sociated with inter -group interactions (C risp & T urner , 2009). Wha t are some e xamples o f
social groups tha t you b elong to tha t contribute to y our identity? So cial groups c an include g ender , rac e,
ethnicity , nationality , social clas s, religion , sexual orienta tion , pro fession , and man y more . And , as is tr ue for
social roles , you c an simultaneously b e a memb er o f more than one so cial group . An e xample o f prejudic e is
having a neg ative attitude to ward p eople who are not b orn in the Unite d Sta tes. Although p eople holding this
prejudic ed attitude do not kno w all p eople who w ere not b orn in the Unite d Sta tes, the y dislik e them due to
their s tatus as f oreigners .
Can y ou think o f a prejudic ed attitude y ou ha ve held to ward a group o f people? Ho w did y our prejudic e
develop? P rejudic e often b egins in the f orm o f astereot ype—tha t is, a sp ecific b elief or as sumption a bout
individuals b ased solely on their memb ership in a group , reg ardles s of their individual characteris tics.
Stereotyp es b ecome o vergeneraliz ed and applie d to all memb ers o f a group . For e xample , someone holding
prejudic ed attitudes to ward older adults , ma y believ e tha t older adults are slo w and inc omp etent (Cuddy ,
Norton, & F iske, 2005; N elson , 2004). W e cannot p ossibly kno w each individual p erson o f adv anced age to
kno w tha t all older adults are slo w and inc omp etent . Theref ore, this neg ative belief is o vergeneraliz ed to all
memb ers o f the group , even though man y of the individual group memb ers ma y in fact b e spr y and intellig ent.
Another e xample o f a w ell-kno wn s tereotyp e involves b eliefs a bout racial diff erenc es among a thletes . As
Hodge, Burden , Robinson , and Bennet t (2008) p oint out , Black a thletes are o ften b eliev ed to b e more a thletic ,
yet les s intellig ent, than their White c ounterp arts. These b eliefs p ersis t despite a numb er o f high pro file
examples to the c ontrar y. Sadly , such b eliefs o ften influenc e ho w these a thletes are tre ated by others and ho w
they view themselv es and their o wn c apabilities . Whether or not y ou a gree with a s tereotyp e, stereotyp es are
generally w ell-kno wn within a giv en culture (Devine , 1989).
Sometimes p eople will act on their prejudic ed attitudes to ward a group o f people , and this b ehavior is kno wn
as discrimina tion .Discriminat ion is neg ative action to ward an individual as a result o f one ’s memb ership in a
particular group (A llport, 1954; Do vidio & G aertner , 2004). As a result o f holding neg ative beliefs (s tereotyp es)
and neg ative attitudes (prejudic e) about a p articular group , people o ften tre at the targ et of prejudic e poorly ,
such as e xcluding older adults from their circle o f friends . In this w ay, discrimina tion is a f orm o f oppres sion .
An e xample o f a ps ychologis t experiencing g ender discrimina tion is f ound in the lif e and s tudies o f Mar y
Whiton C alkins . Calkins w as giv en sp ecial p ermis sion to a ttend gradua te seminars a t Har vard (a t tha t time in
the la te 1880s , Har vard did not ac cept w omen) and a t one p oint w as the sole s tudent o f the famous

Har vard refuse d to grant C alkins a PhD b ecause she w as a w oman (Har vard Univ ersity , 2019). Table 12.312.5 • P rejudic e and Discrimina tion 423
summariz es the characteris tics o f stereotyp es, prejudic e, and discrimina tion . Ha ve you ev er b een the targ et of

Prejudice and Discrimination
When w e meet s trang ers w e automa tically pro cess three piec es o f inf orma tion a bout them: their rac e, gender ,
and a ge (Ito & Urland , 2003). Wh y are these asp ects o f an unfamiliar p erson so imp ortant? Wh y don ’t we
instead notic e whether their e yes are friendly , whether the y are smiling , their height , the typ e of clothes the y
are w earing? A lthough these sec ondar y characteris tics are imp ortant in f orming a firs t impres sion o f a
strang er, the so cial c ategories o f rac e, gender , and a ge pro vide a w ealth o f inf orma tion a bout an individual .
This inf orma tion , however, often is b ased on s tereotyp es. We ma y ha ve diff erent e xpecta tions o f strang ers
dep ending on their rac e, gender , and a ge. Wha t stereotyp es and prejudic es do y ou hold a bout p eople who are
from a rac e, gender , and a ge group diff erent from y our o wn?
Racism
Racism isprejudic eand discrimina tion agains t an individual b ased solely on one ’s memb ership in a sp ecific
racial group (such as to ward Afric an Americ ans, Asian Americ ans, Latinos , Native Americ ans, Europ ean
Americ ans). Wha t are some s tereotyp es o f various racial or ethnic groups? R esearch sugg ests cultural
stereotyp es for Asian Americ ans include c old, sly , and intellig ent; f or La tinos , cold and unintellig ent; f or

Europ ean Americ ans, cold and intellig ent; and f or Afric an Americ ans, aggres sive, athletic , and more lik ely to
be law bre akers (Devine & Elliot , 1995; F iske, Cuddy , Glick , & X u, 2002; Sommers & Ells worth, 2000; Dix on &
Linz, 2000).
Racism e xists for man y racial and ethnic groups . For e xample , Black p eople are signific antly more lik ely to
have their v ehicles se arche d during tra ffic s tops than White p eople , particularly when Black p eople are driving
in pre domina tely White neighb orho ods, a phenomenon o ften terme d “D WB” or “ driving while Black ” (Rojek ,
Rosenf eld, & Deck er, 2012).
Mexican Americ ans and other La tino groups also are targ ets o f racism from the p olice and other memb ers o f
the c ommunity . For e xample , when purchasing items with a p ersonal check , Latino shopp ers are more lik ely
than White shopp ers to b e ask ed to sho w formal identific ation (Do vidio et al ., 2010).
In one c ase o f alleg ed haras sment b y the p olice, sev eral Eas t Ha ven, Connecticut , police officers w ere arres ted
on f ederal charg es due to rep ortedly c ontinue d haras sment and br utaliza tion o f Latinos . When the ac cusa tions
came out , the ma yor o f Eas t Ha ven w as ask ed, “Wha t are y ou doing f or the La tino c ommunity to day?” The
Mayor resp onde d, “I might ha ve tac os when I g o home , I’m not quite sure y et” (“Eas t Ha ven Ma yor,” 2012). This
statement undermines the imp ortant is sue o f racial pro filing and p olice haras sment o f Latinos , while b elittling
Latino culture b y emphasizing an interes t in a f ood pro duct s tereotypic ally as sociated with La tinos .
Racism is prev alent to ward man y other groups in the Unite d Sta tes including N ative Americ ans, Ara b
Americ ans, Jewish Americ ans, and Asian Americ ans. Ha ve you e xperienc ed or witnes sed racism to ward an y of
these racial or ethnic groups? Are y ou a ware o f racism in y our c ommunity?
One re ason mo dern f orms o f racism , and prejudic e in g eneral , are hard to detect is rela ted to the dual a ttitudes
model ( Wilson , Lindse y, & Scho oler , 2000). Humans ha ve tw o forms o f attitudes: e xplicit a ttitudes , which are
conscious and c ontrolla ble, and implicit a ttitudes , which are unc onscious and unc ontrolla ble (Devine , 1989;
Olson & F azio , 2003). Bec ause holding eg alitarian view s is so cially desira ble (Plant & Devine , 1998), mos t
people do not sho w extreme racial bias or other prejudic es on me asures o f their e xplicit a ttitudes . Ho wever,
measures o f implicit a ttitudes o ften sho w evidenc e of mild to s trong racial bias or other prejudic es (Green wald,
McGee , & Sch wartz, 1998; Olson & F azio , 2003).
Sexism
Sexism isprejudic eand discrimina tion toward individuals b ased on their se x. Typic ally, sexism tak es the f orm
of men holding biases a gains t women , but an yone c an sho w se xism to ward their o wn or the other se x. Lik e
racism , sexism ma y be subtle and difficult to detect . Common f orms o f sexism in mo dern so ciety include
gender role e xpecta tions , such as e xpecting w omen to b e the c aretak ers o f the household . Sexism also includes
people ’s expecta tions f or ho w memb ers o f a g ender group should b ehave. For e xample , women are e xpecte d to
be friendly , passive, and nur turing , and when w omen b ehave in an unfriendly , assertive, or neglectful manner
they often are dislik ed for viola ting their g ender role (R udman , 1998). R esearch b y La urie R udman (1998) finds
that when f emale job applic ants self -promote , the y are lik ely to b e view ed as c omp etent , but the y ma y be
dislik ed and are les s lik ely to b e hire d because the y viola ted gender e xpecta tions f or mo desty. In this w ay,
women are sometimes blame d for w age and emplo yment ine quality , but the y would b e view ed neg atively f or
trying to o vercome them , a phenomenon sometimes ref erre d to as the double bind . Sexism c an e xist on a
societal lev el such as in hiring , emplo yment opp ortunities , and e duc ation . Women are les s lik ely to b e hire d or
promote d in male -domina ted pro fessions such as engineering , aviation , and c onstruction ( Figure 12.22 ) (Bla u,
Ferber, & W inkler , 2010; C eci & W illiams , 2011). Ha ve you ev er experienc ed or witnes sed se xism? Think a bout
your family memb ers’ jobs or c areers . Wh y do y ou think there are diff erenc es in the jobs w omen and men
have, such as more w omen nurses but more male surg eons (Betz, 2008)?12.5 • P rejudic e and Discrimina tion 425

Ageism
People o ften f orm judgments and hold e xpecta tions a bout p eople b ased on their a ge. These judgments and
expecta tions c an le ad to ageism , orprejudic eand discrimina tion toward individuals b ased solely on their a ge.
Think o f expecta tions y ou hold f or older adults . Ho w could someone ’s expecta tions influenc e the f eelings the y
hold to ward individuals from older a ge groups? Ag eism is widespre ad in U .S. culture (N osek , 2005), and a
common a geist attitude to ward older adults is tha t the y are inc omp etent , physically w eak, and slo w
(Greenb erg, Schimel , & Mar tens , 2002) and some p eople c onsider older adults les s attractiv e. Chang , Kannoth ,
Levy, Wang , Lee , and Lev y (2020) rep orted on rela tionships b etween a geism and he alth outc omes o ver a
40-year-plus p erio d from c ountries around the w orld . Acros s 11 he alth domains , people o ver 50 w ere lik ely to
experienc e ageism mos t often in the f orm o f being denie d ac cess to he alth ser vices and w ork opp ortunities .
Some cultures , however, including some Asian , Latino , and Afric an Americ an cultures , both outside and within
the Unite d Sta tes a fford older adults resp ect and honor .
Typic ally, ageism o ccurs a gains t older adults , but a geism also c an o ccur to ward y oung er adults . Wha t
expecta tions do y ou hold to ward y oung er p eople? Do es so ciety e xpect y oung er adults to b e imma ture and
irresp onsible? Are y oung er g enera tions seen as ha ving it to o easy or ha ving w eaker characters than older
genera tions? Ra ymer , Reed, Spieg el, and Pur vanova (2017) e xamine d ageism a gains t young er w orkers. The y
found tha t older w orkers endorse d neg ative stereotyp es o f young er w orkers, believing tha t the y had more w ork
deficit characteris tics (including p erceptions o f inc omp etenc e). Ho w might these f orms o f ageism a ffect a
young er and older adult who are applying f or a sales clerk p osition?
Homophobia and T ransphobia
Another f orm o f prejudic e is homophobia : an umbrella term ref erring to prejudic eand discrimina tion of
individuals b ased solely on their se xual orienta tion , which is o ften applie d to bise xual , lesbian , gay, and other
non-heterose xual p eople . Transphobia is the ha tred or f ear o f those who are p erceived to bre ak or blur
stereotypic al gender roles , often e xpres sed as s tereotyping , discrimina tion , haras sment and/or violenc e. Lik e
ageism ,homophobia is a widespre ad prejudic e in U .S. so ciety tha t is tolera ted by man y people (Herek &
McLemore , 2013; N osek , 2005). N egative feelings o ften result in discrimina tion , such as the e xclusion o f
lesbian , gay, bise xual , trans gender , and queer (L GBTQ+) p eople from so cial groups and the a voidanc e of
LGBTQ+ neighb ors and c o-workers. This discrimina tion also e xtends to emplo yers delib erately declining to
hire qualifie d LGBTQ+ job applic ants , a practic e officially outla wed by a 2020 Surpreme C ourt decision but
which remains a signific ant is sue. Ha ve you e xperienc ed or witnes sed homophobia? If so , wha t stereotyp es,
prejudic ed attitudes , and discrimina tion w ere evident?426 12 • Social P sycholog y

Resear ch into Homophobia
Some people ar e quit e pas sionat e in their hatr ed for nonhet erosexuals in our society . In some cases , people
have been t ortured and/or mur dered simpl y because the y were not s traight. This pas sionat e response has led
some r esear chers t o ques tion what motiv es might e xist for homophobic people . Adams , Wright, & L ohr (1996)
conduct ed a s tudy in vestigating this is sue and their r esul ts w ere quit e an e ye-opener .
In this e xperiment, male c ollege students w ere giv en a scale that as sessed ho w homophobic the y were; those
with e xtreme sc ores w ere recruit ed to par ticipat e in the e xperiment. In the end, 64 men agr eed t o par ticipat e
and w ere split int o 2 gr oups: homophobic men and nonhomophobic men. Both gr oups o f men w ere fitted with a
penile pleth ysmogr aph, an ins trument that measur es chang es in blood flo w to the penis and ser ves as an
objectiv e measur ement o f sexual ar ousal .
All men w ere sho wn segments o f sexual ly explicit videos . One o f these videos in volved a se xual int eraction
betw een a man and a w oman (s traight clip). One video displa yed tw o females eng aged in a se xual int eraction
(lesbian clip), and the final video displa yed tw o men eng aged in a se xual int eraction ( gay clip). Chang es in penile
tumesc ence (a measur e of physiological g enital ar ousal) w ere recorded during al l thr ee clips , and a subjectiv e
measur ement o f sexual ar ousal w as also ob tained. While both gr oups o f men became se xual ly aroused t o the
straight and lesbian video clips , onl y those men who w ere identified as homophobic sho wed se xual ar ousal t o
the g ay male video clip . While al l men r epor ted that their er ections indicat ed ar ousal f or the s traight and lesbian
clips , the homophobic men indicat ed that the y were not se xual ly aroused (despit e their er ections) t o the g ay
clips . Adams et al . (1996) sug gest that these findings ma y indicat e that homophobia is r elated to gay arousal that
the homophobic individuals either den y or ar e una ware.
Why Do Pr ejudice and Discrimination Exist?
Prejudic eand discrimina tion persis t in so ciety due to so cial le arning and c onformity to so cial norms . Children
learn prejudic ed attitudes and b eliefs from so ciety: their p arents , teachers , friends , the me dia, and other
sourc es o f socializa tion , such as so cial me dia (O ’Keeff e & Clark e-Pearson , 2011). If c ertain typ es o f prejudic e
and discrimina tion are ac cepta ble in a so ciety , there ma y be norma tive pres sures to c onform and share those
prejudic ed beliefs , attitudes , and b ehaviors . For e xample , public and priv ate scho ols are s till somewha t
segreg ated by so cial clas s. His toric ally, only children from w ealth y families c ould a fford to a ttend priv ate
scho ols, where as children from middle - and lo w-inc ome families typic ally a ttende d public scho ols. If a child
from a lo w-inc ome family rec eived a merit scholarship to a ttend a priv ate scho ol, how might the child b e
treated by clas sma tes? C an y ou rec all a time when y ou held prejudic ed attitudes or b eliefs or acte d in a
discrimina tory manner b ecause y our group o f friends e xpecte d you to?
Ster eotypes and Self -Fulfilling Pr ophecy
When w e hold a stereotyp eabout a p erson , we ha ve expecta tions tha t the y will fulfill tha t stereotyp e. Aself-
fulfilling prophecy is an e xpecta tion held b y a p erson tha t alters their b ehavior in a w ay tha t tends to mak e it
true. When w e hold s tereotyp es a bout a p erson , we tend to tre at the p erson ac cording to our e xpecta tions . This
treatment c an influenc e the p erson to act ac cording to our s tereotypic e xpecta tions , thus c onfirming our
stereotypic b eliefs . Research b y Rosenthal and J acobson (1968) f ound tha t disadv anta ged students whose
teachers e xpecte d them to p erform w ell had higher grades than disadv anta ged students whose te achers
expecte d them to do p oorly .
Consider this e xample o f cause and eff ect in a self -fulfilling prophecy: If an emplo yer expects an op enly g ay job
applic ant to b e inc omp etent , the p otential emplo yer might tre at the applic ant neg atively during the inter view
by eng aging in les s conversa tion , making lit tle e ye contact , and g enerally b ehaving c oldly to ward the applic antDIG DEEPER12.5 • P rejudic e and Discrimina tion 427
(Hebl , Foster, Mannix , & Do vidio , 2002). In turn , the job applic ant will p erceive tha t the p otential emplo yer
dislik es him , and he will resp ond b y giving shor ter resp onses to inter view ques tions , making les s eye contact ,
and g enerally diseng aging from the inter view . After the inter view , the emplo yer will reflect on the applic ant’s
behavior , which seeme d cold and dis tant , and the emplo yer will c onclude , based on the applic ant’s poor
performanc e during the inter view , tha t the applic ant w as in fact inc omp etent . Thus , the emplo yer’s
stereotyp e—gay people are inc omp etent and do not mak e good emplo yees—is reinf orced. Do y ou think this job
applic ant is lik ely to b e hire d? T reating individuals ac cording to s tereotypic b eliefs c an le ad to prejudic e and
discrimina tion .
Another dynamic tha t can reinf orce stereotyp es is c onfirma tion bias . When interacting with the targ et of our
prejudic e, we tend to p ay attention to inf orma tion tha t is c onsis tent with our s tereotypic e xpecta tions and
ignore inf orma tion tha t is inc onsis tent with our e xpecta tions . In this pro cess, kno wn as confirmat ion bias , we
seek out inf orma tion tha t supp orts our s tereotyp es and ignore inf orma tion tha t is inc onsis tent with our
stereotyp es (Wason & J ohnson-Laird , 1972). In the job inter view e xample , the emplo yer ma y not ha ve notic ed
that the job applic ant w as friendly and eng aging , and tha t he pro vide d comp etent resp onses to the inter view
ques tions in the b eginning o f the inter view . Ins tead, the emplo yer focuse d on the job applic ant’s performanc e
in the la ter p art of the inter view , after the applic ant chang ed his deme anor and b ehavior to ma tch the
inter view er’s neg ative tre atment . Ha ve you ev er fallen pre y to the self -fulfilling prophecy or c onfirma tion bias ,
either as the sourc e or targ et of such bias? Ho w might w e stop the cy cle o f the self -fulfilling prophecy?
In-Gr oups and Out-Gr oups
As discus sed previously in this section , we all b elong to a g ender , rac e, age, and so cial ec onomic group . These
groups pro vide a p owerful sourc e of our identity and self -esteem ( Tajfel & T urner , 1979). These groups ser ve as
our in-groups . An in-group is a group tha t we identif y with or see ourselv es as b elonging to . A group tha t we
don ’t belong to , or an out-group , is a group tha t we view as fundamentally diff erent from us . For e xample , if
you are a w oman , your g ender in-group includes all w omen , and y our g ender out -group includes all men
(Figure 12.23 ). People o ften view g ender groups as b eing fundamentally diff erent from e ach other in
personality traits , characteris tics, social roles , and interes ts. Bec ause w e often f eel a s trong sense o f belonging
and emotional c onnection to our in-groups , we dev elop in-group bias: a pref erenc e for our o wn group o ver
other groups . This in-group bias can result in prejudic e and discrimina tion b ecause the out -group is
perceived as diff erent and is les s pref erre d than our in-group .
FIGURE 12.23 These childr en ar e very young , but the y are alr eady a ware of their g ender in-gr oup and out -group.

Despite the group dynamics tha t seem only to push groups to ward c onflict , there are f orces tha t promote
reconcilia tion b etween groups: the e xpres sion o f emp athy, of ackno wledgment o f past suff ering on b oth sides ,
and the halt o f des tructiv e behaviors .428 12 • Social P sycholog y

One function o f prejudic e is to help us f eel g ood about ourselv es and maintain a p ositiv e self -concept. This
need to f eel g ood about ourselv es e xtends to our in-groups: W e want to f eel g ood and protect our in-groups . We
seek to resolv e thre ats individually and a t the in-group lev el. This o ften happ ens b y blaming an out -group f or
the problem .Scapegoating is the act o f blaming an out -group when the in-group e xperienc es fr ustration or is
blocked from obtaining a g oal (A llport, 1954).

LEARNING OBJEC TIVES
By the end o f this section, y ou wil l be able t o:
•Define ag gression
•Define cyberbul lying
•Describe the b ystander eff ect
Throughout this chapter w e ha ve discus sed ho w people interact and influenc e one another ’s thoughts ,
feelings , and b ehaviors in b oth p ositiv e and neg ative ways. People c an w ork tog ether to achiev e gre at things ,
such as helping e ach other in difficult times: c onsider ho w educ ators and he althc are w orkers w ent to gre at
lengths to help others during the C OVID-19 p andemic . People also c an do gre at harm to one another , such as
conforming to group norms tha t are immoral and ob eying a uthority to the p oint o f murder: c onsider the mas s
conformity o f Nazis during W WII. In this section w e will discus s a neg ative side o f human
behavior —aggres sion .
A numb er o f rese archers ha ve explore d ways to re duce prejudic e. One o f the e arlies t was a s tudy b y Sherif et al .
(1961) kno wn as the R obb ers C ave experiment . The y found tha t when tw o opp osing groups a t a c amp w orked
together to ward a c ommon g oal, prejudicial a ttitudes b etween the groups decre ased (G aertner , Do vidio ,
Bank er, Houlet te, Johnson , & McGlynn , 2000). F ocusing on sup erordina te goals w as the k ey to a ttitude chang e
in the rese arch . Another s tudy e xamine d the jigsa w clas sroom, a technique designe d by Aronson and
Bridg eman in an eff ort to incre ase suc cess in desegreg ated clas srooms . In this technique , students w ork on an
assignment in groups inclusiv e of various rac es and a bilities . The y are as signe d tasks within their group , then
collaborate with p eers from other groups who w ere as signe d the same task , and then rep ort back to their
original group . Walker and C rogan (1998) note d tha t the jigsa w clas sroom re duced potential f or prejudic e in
Australia, as div erse s tudents w orked tog ether on projects nee ding all o f the piec es to suc ceed. This rese arch
sugg ests tha t an ything tha t can allo w individuals to w ork tog ether to ward c ommon g oals c an decre ase
prejudicial a ttitudes . Ob viously , the applic ation o f such s trategies in re al-w orld set tings w ould enhanc e
opp ortunities f or c onflict resolution .
Aggr ession
Humans eng age in aggres sion when the y seek to c ause harm or p ain to another p erson . Aggres sion tak es tw o
forms dep ending on one ’s motiv es: hos tile or ins trumental .Hos tile a ggres sion is motiv ated by feelings o f
anger with intent to c ause p ain; a fight in a b ar with a s trang er is an e xample o f hos tile a ggres sion . In c ontras t,
instrumental a ggres sion is motiv ated by achieving a g oal and do es not nec essarily in volve intent to c ause

There are man y diff erent theories as to wh y aggres sion e xists. Some rese archers argue tha t aggres sion ser ves
an ev olutionar y function (B uss, 2004). Men are more lik ely than w omen to sho w aggres sion ( Wilson & Daly ,
1985). F rom the p ersp ectiv e of evolutionar y ps ycholog y, human male a ggres sion , like tha t in nonhuman
prima tes, likely ser ves to displa y dominanc e over other males , both to protect a ma te and to p erpetua te the
male ’s genes ( Figure 12.24 ). Se xual je alous y is p art of male a ggres sion; males ende avor to mak e sure their
mates are not c opula ting with other males , thus ensuring their o wn p aternity o f the f emale ’s offspring .
Although a ggres sion pro vides an ob vious ev olutionar y adv anta ge for men , women also eng age in a ggres sion .
Women typic ally displa y more indirect f orms o f aggres sion , with their a ggres sion ser ving as a me ans to an end
(Dodge & Sch wartz, 1997). F or e xample , women ma y expres s their a ggres sion c overtly b y communic ation tha t12.6 • Ag gression 429
imp airs the so cial s tanding o f another p erson . Another theor y tha t explains one o f the functions o f human
aggres sion is frustration a ggres sion theor y(Dollard , Do ob, Miller , Mo wrer , & Se ars, 1939). This theor y states
that when humans are prev ente d from achieving an imp ortant g oal, the y become fr ustrated and a ggres sive.

Bullying
Another f orm o f aggres sion is bullying . As y ou le arn in y our s tudy o f child dev elopment , socializing and
playing with other children is b eneficial f or children ’s ps ychologic al dev elopment . Ho wever, as y ou ma y ha ve
experienc ed as a child , not all pla y behavior has p ositiv e outc omes . Some children are a ggres sive and w ant to
play roughly . Other children are selfish and do not w ant to share to ys. One f orm o f neg ative so cial interactions
among children tha t has b ecome a na tional c oncern is bullying .Bullying is rep eated neg ative tre atment o f
another p erson , often an adolesc ent, over time (Olw eus, 1993). A one -time incident in which one child hits
another child on the pla yground w ould not b e considere d bullying: B ullying is rep eated behavior . The neg ative
treatment typic al in bullying is the a ttempt to inflict harm , injur y, or humilia tion , and bullying c an include
physical or v erbal attacks . Ho wever, bullying do esn’t ha ve to b e ph ysical or v erbal, it c an b e ps ychologic al.
Research finds g ender diff erenc es in ho w girls and b oys bully others (Americ an P sychologic al As sociation ,
2010; Olw eus, 1993). Bo ys tend to eng age in direct , physical aggres sion such as ph ysically harming others .
Girls tend to eng age in indirect , social f orms o f aggres sion such as spre ading r umors , ignoring , or so cially
isola ting others . Base d on wha t you ha ve learne d about child dev elopment and so cial roles , wh y do y ou think
boys and girls displa y diff erent typ es o f bullying b ehavior?
Bullying in volves three p arties: the bully , the victim , and witnes ses or b ystanders . The act o f bullying in volves
an imb alanc e of power with the bully holding more p ower—ph ysically, emotionally , and/or so cially o ver the
victim . The e xperienc e of bullying c an b e positiv e for the bully , who ma y enjo y a b oost to self -esteem . Ho wever,
there are sev eral neg ative conse quenc es o f bullying f or the victim , and also f or the b ystanders . Ho w do y ou
think bullying neg atively imp acts adolesc ents? Being the victim o f bullying is as sociated with decre ased
mental he alth , including e xperiencing anxiety and depres sion (AP A, 2010). V ictims o f bullying ma y
underp erform in scho olwork (Bo wen, 2011). B ullying also c an result in the victim dying b y suicide (AP A,
2010). Ho w might bullying neg atively a ffect witnes ses?
Although there is not one single p ersonality pro file f or who b ecomes a bully and who b ecomes a victim o f
bullying (APA, 2010), rese archers ha ve identifie d some p atterns in children who are a t a gre ater risk o f being
bullie d (Olw eus, 1993):
•Children who are emotionally re activ e are a t a gre ater risk f or b eing bullie d. Bullies ma y be attracte d to
children who g et upset e asily b ecause the bully c an quickly g et an emotional re action from them .
•Children who are diff erent from others are lik ely to b e targ eted for bullying . Children who are o verweight ,
cognitiv ely imp aire d, or racially or ethnic ally diff erent from their p eer group ma y be at higher risk .
•Gay, lesbian , bise xual , and trans gender teens are a t very high risk o f being bullie d and hur t due to their
sexual orienta tion .430 12 • Social P sycholog y

Cyberbullying
With widely a vailable mobile technolog y and so cial netw orking me dia, a new f orm o f bullying has emerg ed:
cyberbullying .Cyb erbullying , like bullying , is rep eated behavior tha t is intende d to c ause ps ychologic al or
emotional harm to another p erson . Wha t is unique a bout cyb erbullying is tha t it is typic ally c overt, concealed,
done in priv ate, and the bully c an remain anon ymous . This anon ymity giv es the bully p ower, and the victim
may feel helples s, una ble to esc ape the haras sment , and una ble to retalia te (S pears, Slee , Owens, & J ohnson ,
2009). Ab out one in three middle and high scho ol students rep ort tha t the y ha ve experienc ed cyb erbullying
(Patchin , 2016; P atchin , 2019), with some s tudies indic ating tha t ne arly three in fiv e teens ha ve experienc ed
some typ e of online a busiv e behavior such as non-rep eated name -calling or b eing sent unsolicite d links or
ima ges (Anderson , 2018).
Cyb erbullying c an tak e man y forms , including haras sing a victim b y spre ading r umors , cre ating a w ebsite
defaming the victim , thre atening the victim , or te asing the victim (S pears et al ., 2009). O verall , LGBTQ youth
are targ eted at a higher ra te than heterose xual and cis gender y outh , and memb ers o f minority p opula tions
overall are more lik ely to b e cyb erbullying victims (Hinjuda & P atchin , 2020). In terms o f gender , experienc es
vary in terms o f both the prev elanc e and typ es o f cyb erbullying e xperienc ed and p erpetra ted. In cyb erbullying ,
it is more c ommon f or girls to b e the bullies and victims . Interes tingly , girls who b ecome cyb erbullies o ften
have been the victims o f cyb erbullying a t one time ( Vandeb osch & V an Cleemput , 2009). Girls w ere more lik ely
to sa y someone spre ad r umors a bout them online while b oys were more lik ely to sa y tha t someone thre atene d
to hur t them online (P atchin , 2019). The eff ects o f cyb erbullying are jus t as harmful as traditional bullying and
include the victim f eeling fr ustration , ang er, sadnes s, helples snes s, powerles snes s, and f ear. Victims will also
experienc e lower self -esteem (Ho ff & Mitchell , 2009; S pears et al ., 2009). F urthermore , rec ent rese arch
sugg ests tha t both cyb erbullying victims and p erpetra tors are more lik ely to e xperienc e suicidal ide ation , and
they are more lik ely to a ttempt suicide than individuals who ha ve no e xperienc e with cyb erbullying (J ohn ,
2019). Cyb erbullying is a f orm o f aggres sion and , dep ending on the mes sages and metho ds, can b e considere d
haras sment , stalking , or as sault—all subject to prosecution . Finally , while much o f the c oncern and rese arch
regarding cyb erbullying c enters on adolesc ents , adults (p articularly c olleg e students) are fre quent victims and
perpetra tors . Wha t features o f technolog y mak e cyb erbullying e asier and p erhaps more ac cessible to y oung
adults? Wha t can p arents , teachers , and so cial netw orking w ebsites do to prev ent cyb erbullying?

The Bystander Eff ect
The discus sion o f bullying highlights the problem o f witnes ses not inter vening to help a victim . Researchers
Latané and Darle y (1968) describ ed a phenomenon c alled the b ystander eff ect. The bystander eff ectis a
phenomenon in which a witnes s or b ystander do es not v olunteer to help a victim or p erson in dis tres s. Ins tead,
they jus t watch wha t is happ ening . Social ps ychologis ts hold tha t we mak e these decisions b ased on the so cial
situa tion , not our o wn p ersonality v aria bles . The imp etus b ehind the b ystander eff ect w as the murder o f a
young w oman name d Kit ty Geno vese in 1964. The s tory of her tra gic de ath to ok on a lif e of its o wn when it w as
reported tha t none o f her neighb ors help ed her or c alled the p olice when she w as b eing a ttack ed. Ho wever,12.6 • Ag gression 431
Kassin (2017) note d tha t her killer w as apprehende d due to neighb ors who c alled the p olice when the y sa w
him c ommit ting a burglar y da ys later. Not only did b ystanders indee d inter vene in her murder (one man who
shoute d at the killer , a w oman who said she c alled the p olice, and a friend who c omf orted her in her las t
moments), but other b ystanders inter vened in the c apture o f the murderer . Social ps ychologis ts claim tha t
diffusion o f resp onsibility is the lik ely e xplana tion .Diffusion of resp onsibilit yis the tendency f or no one in a
group to help b ecause the resp onsibility to help is spre ad throughout the group (Bandura, 1999). Bec ause
there w ere man y witnes ses to the a ttack on Geno vese, as evidenc ed by the numb er o f lit ap artment windo ws in
the building , individuals as sume d someone else mus t ha ve alre ady c alled the p olice. The resp onsibility to c all
the p olice was diffuse d acros s the numb er o f witnes ses to the crime . Ha ve you ev er p assed an ac cident on the

•Describe the triang ular theor y of love
•Explain social e xchang e theor y in r elationships
You’ve learne d about man y of the neg ative behaviors o f social ps ycholog y, but the field also s tudies man y
positiv e so cial interactions and b ehaviors . Wha t mak es p eople lik e each other? W ith whom are w e friends?
Whom do w e da te? R esearchers ha ve do cumente d sev eral f eatures o f the situa tion tha t influenc e whether w e
form rela tionships with others . There are also univ ersal traits tha t humans find a ttractiv e in others . In this
section w e discus s conditions tha t mak e forming rela tionships more lik ely, wha t we look for in friendships and
romantic rela tionships , the diff erent typ es o f love, and a theor y explaining ho w our rela tionships are f orme d,
maintaine d, and termina ted.
Prosocial Behavior and Altruism
Do y ou v oluntarily help others? V oluntar y behavior with the intent to help other p eople is c alledproso cial
beha vior . Wh y do p eople help other p eople? Is p ersonal b enefit such as f eeling g ood about oneself the only
reason p eople help one another? R esearch sugg ests there are man y other re asons .Altr uism is people ’s desire
to help others ev en if the c osts outw eigh the b enefits o f helping . In fact , people acting in altr uistic w ays ma y
disreg ard the p ersonal c osts as sociated with helping ( Figure 12.26 ). For e xample , new s ac counts o f the 9/11
terroris t attacks on the W orld T rade C enter in N ew Y ork rep orted an emplo yee in the firs t tower help ed his c o-
workers mak e it to the e xit s tairwell. After helping a c o-worker to sa fety he w ent b ack in the burning building

responders and man y ordinar y people . (credit: Don Halas y)
Some rese archers sugg est tha t altr uism op erates on emp athy.Emp athyis the c apacity to unders tand another
person ’s persp ectiv e, to f eel wha t the y feel. An emp athetic p erson mak es an emotional c onnection with others
and f eels c omp elled to help (Ba tson , 1991). Other rese archers argue tha t altr uism is a f orm o f selfles s helping
that is not motiv ated by benefits or f eeling g ood about oneself. C ertainly , after helping , people f eel g ood about
themselv es, but some rese archers argue tha t this is a c onse quenc e of altr uism , not a c ause. Other rese archers
argue tha t helping is alw ays self -ser ving b ecause our eg os are in volved, and w e rec eive benefits from helping
(Cialdini , Bro wn, Lewis , Luce, & N eub erg 1997). It is challenging to determine e xperimentally the tr ue
motiv ation f or helping , whether it is larg ely self -ser ving (eg oism) or selfles s (altr uism). Thus , a deb ate on
whether pure altr uism e xists continues .

Forming R elationships
Wha t do y ou think is the single mos t influential factor in determining with whom y ou b ecome friends and
whom y ou f orm romantic rela tionships? Y ou might b e surprise d to le arn tha t the ans wer is simple: the p eople
with whom y ou ha ve the mos t contact . This mos t imp ortant factor is pro ximity . You are more lik ely to b e
friends with p eople y ou ha ve regular c ontact with . For e xample , there are dec ades o f rese arch tha t sho ws tha t
you are more lik ely to b ecome friends with p eople who liv e in y our dorm , your ap artment building , or y our
imme diate neighb orho od than with p eople who liv e far ther a way (Festing er, Schachler , & Back , 1950). It is
simply e asier to f orm rela tionships with p eople y ou see o ften b ecause y ou ha ve the opp ortunity to g et to kno w
them .
Similarity is another factor tha t influenc es who w e form rela tionships with . We are more lik ely to b ecome
friends or lo vers with someone who is similar to us in b ackground , attitudes , and lif estyle. In fact , there is no
evidenc e tha t opp osites a ttract . Rather , we are a ttracte d to p eople who are mos t lik e us ( Figure 12.27 )
(McPherson , Smith-Lo vin, & C ook, 2001). Wh y do y ou think w e are a ttracte d to p eople who are similar to us?
Sharing things in c ommon will c ertainly mak e it e asy to g et along with others and f orm c onnections . When y ou
and another p erson share similar music tas te, hobbies , food pref erenc es, and so on , deciding wha t to do with
your time tog ether might b e easy.Homophily is the tendency f or p eople to f orm so cial netw orks , including
friendships , marria ge, busines s rela tionships , and man y other typ es o f rela tionships , with others who are
12.7 • P rosocial Beha vior 433
similar (McPherson et al ., 2001).

quite ob vious in a c eremon y such as a w edding , and mor e sub tle (but no les s significant) in the da y-to-day workings
of a relationship . (credit: modification o f work b y Shir az Chana wala)
But, homophily limits our e xposure to div ersity (McPherson et al ., 2001). B y forming rela tionships only with
people who are similar to us , we will ha ve homog enous groups and will not b e exposed to diff erent p oints o f
view . In other w ords , because w e are lik ely to sp end time with those who are mos t lik e ourselv es, we will ha ve
limite d exposure to those who are diff erent than ourselv es, including p eople o f diff erent rac es, ethnicities ,
social-ec onomic s tatus, and lif e situa tions .
Onc e we form rela tionships with p eople , we desire recipro city.Recipro cityis the giv e and tak e in
rela tionships . We contribute to rela tionships , but w e expect to rec eive benefits as w ell. Tha t is, we want our
rela tionships to b e a tw o way street . We are more lik ely to lik e and eng age with p eople who lik e us b ack. Self -
disclosure is p art of the tw o way street .Self -disclosure is the sharing o f personal inf orma tion (La urenc eau,
Barret t, & Pietromonac o, 1998). W e form more intima te connections with p eople with whom w e disclose
imp ortant inf orma tion a bout ourselv es. Indee d, self -disclosure is a characteris tic o f he alth y intima te
rela tionships , as long as the inf orma tion disclose d is c onsis tent with our o wn view s (Cozby, 1973).
Attr action
We ha ve discus sed ho w pro ximity and similarity le ad to the f orma tion o f rela tionships , and tha t recipro city
and self -disclosure are imp ortant f or rela tionship maintenanc e. But, wha t features o f a p erson do w e find
attractiv e? W e don ’t form rela tionships with ev eryone tha t lives or w orks ne ar us , so ho w is it tha t we decide
which sp ecific individuals w e will select as friends and lo vers?
Researchers ha ve do cumente d sev eral characteris tics tha t humans find a ttractiv e. First we look for friends and
lovers who are ph ysically a ttractiv e. People diff er in wha t the y consider a ttractiv e, and a ttractiv enes s is
culturally influenc ed. Research , however, sugg ests tha t some univ ersally a ttractiv e features in w omen include
larg e eyes, high cheekb ones , a narro w ja w line , a slender build (B uss, 1989), and a lo wer w aist-to-hip ra tio
(Singh , 1993). F or men , attractiv e traits include b eing tall , having bro ad shoulders , and a narro w w aist (Buss,
1989). Both men and w omen with high lev els o f facial and b ody s ymmetr y are g enerally c onsidere d more
attractiv e than as ymmetric individuals (F ink, Neave, Manning , & Grammer , 2006; P enton-V oak et al ., 2001;
Rikowski & Grammer , 1999). So cial traits tha t people find a ttractiv e in p otential f emale ma tes include w armth ,
affection , and so cial skills; in males , the a ttractiv e traits include achiev ement , leadership qualities , and job
skills (R egan & Berscheid , 1997). A lthough humans w ant ma tes who are ph ysically a ttractiv e, this do es not
mean tha t we look for the mos t attractiv e person p ossible . In fact , this obser vation has le d some to prop ose
wha t is kno wn as the ma tching h ypothesis which as serts tha t people tend to pick someone the y view as their
equal in ph ysical attractiv enes s and so cial desira bility ( Taylor , Fiore , Mendelsohn , & Cheshire , 2011). F or
example , you and mos t people y ou kno w lik ely w ould sa y tha t a v ery attractiv e mo vie s tar is out o f your le ague.434 12 • Social P sycholog y

So, even if y ou had pro ximity to tha t person , you lik ely w ould not ask them out on a da te because y ou b eliev e
you lik ely w ould b e rejecte d. People w eigh a p otential p artner ’s attractiv enes s agains t the lik eliho od of suc cess

Sternberg’ s Triangular Theory of Love
We typic ally lo ve the p eople with whom w e form rela tionships , but the typ e of love we ha ve for our family ,
friends , and lo vers diff ers. Robert Sternb erg (1986) prop osed tha t there are three c omp onents o f love:
intimacy , passion , and c ommitment . These three c omp onents f orm a triangle tha t defines multiple typ es o f
love: this is kno wn as Sternb erg’striangular theor y of lo ve(Figure 12.28 ). Intimacy is the sharing o f details
and intima te thoughts and emotions . Passion is the ph ysical attraction—the flame in the fire . Commitment is
standing b y the p erson—the “in sicknes s and he alth ” part of the rela tionship .
FIGURE 12.28 According t o Sternber g’s triang ular theor y of love, seven types o f love can be described fr om
combinations o f thr ee c omponents: intimacy , pas sion, and c ommitment. (cr edit: modification o f work b y
“Lnesa”/ Wikimedia Commons)
Sternb erg (1986) s tates tha t a he alth y rela tionship will ha ve all three c omp onents o f love—intimacy , passion ,
and c ommitment —which is describ ed as consummate lo ve(Figure 12.29 ). Ho wever, diff erent asp ects o f love
might b e more prev alent a t diff erent lif e stages. Other f orms o f love include liking , which is define d as ha ving
intimacy but no p assion or c ommitment . Infa tuation is the presenc e of passion without intimacy or
commitment . Empty lo ve is ha ving c ommitment without intimacy or p assion .Comp anionate lo ve, which is
characteris tic o f close friendships and family rela tionships , consis ts of intimacy and c ommitment but no
passion .Romant ic lo veis define d by ha ving p assion and intimacy , but no c ommitment . Finally , fatuous lo ve is
define d by ha ving p assion and c ommitment , but no intimacy , such as a long term se xual lo ve affair . Can y ou
describ e other e xamples o f rela tionships tha t fit these diff erent typ es o f love?12.7 • P rosocial Beha vior 435

Social Ex change Theory
We ha ve discus sed wh y we form rela tionships , wha t attracts us to others , and diff erent typ es o f love. But wha t
determines whether w e are sa tisfied with and s tay in a rela tionship? One theor y tha t pro vides an e xplana tion
is so cial e xchang e theor y. According to social e xchang e theor y, we act as naïv e ec onomis ts in k eeping a tally
of the ra tio o f costs and b enefits o f forming and maintaining a rela tionship with others ( Figure 12.30 ) (Rusbult
& Van Lang e, 2003).

People pref er to ha ve more b enefits than c osts, or to ha ve ne arly e qual c osts and b enefits , but mos t people are

Summary
12.1 What Is Social Psychology?
Social ps ycholog y is the subfield o f psycholog y tha t studies the p ower o f the situa tion to influenc e individuals’
thoughts , feelings , and b ehaviors . Psychologis ts categoriz e the c auses o f human b ehavior as those due to
internal factors , such as p ersonality , or those due to e xternal factors , such as cultural and other so cial
influenc es. Beha vior is b etter e xplaine d, however, by using b oth appro aches . Lay people tend to o ver-rely on
disp ositional e xplana tions f or b ehavior and ignore the p ower o f situa tional influenc es, a p ersp ectiv e called the
fundamental a ttribution error . People from individualis tic cultures are more lik ely to displa y this bias v ersus
people from c ollectivis tic cultures . Our e xplana tions f or our o wn and others b ehaviors c an b e biase d due to not
having enough inf orma tion a bout others’ motiv ations f or b ehaviors and b y pro viding e xplana tions tha t bolster
our self -esteem .
12.2 Self -presentation
Human b ehavior is larg ely influenc ed by our so cial roles , norms , and scripts . In order to kno w ho w to act in a
given situa tion , we ha ve share d cultural kno wledge of ho w to b ehave dep ending on our role in so ciety . Social
norms dicta te the b ehavior tha t is appropria te or inappropria te for e ach role . Each so cial role has scripts tha t
help humans le arn the se quenc e of appropria te behaviors in a giv en set ting . The famous Stanf ord prison
experiment is an e xample o f ho w the p ower o f the situa tion c an dicta te the so cial roles , norms , and scripts w e
follow in a giv en situa tion , even if this b ehavior is c ontrar y to our typic al behavior .
12.3 Attitudes and P ersuasion
Attitudes are our ev alua tions or f eelings to ward a p erson , ide a, or object and typic ally are p ositiv e or neg ative.
Our a ttitudes and b eliefs are influenc ed not only b y external f orces, but also b y internal influenc es tha t we
control . An internal f orm o f attitude chang e is c ognitiv e dis sonanc e or the tension w e experienc e when our
thoughts , feelings , and b ehaviors are in c onflict . In order to re duce dis sonanc e, individuals c an chang e their
behavior , attitudes , or c ognitions , or add a new c ognition . External f orces o f persuasion include adv ertising;
the f eatures o f adv ertising tha t influenc e our b ehaviors include the sourc e, mes sage, and a udienc e. There are
two primar y routes to p ersuasion . The c entral route to p ersuasion uses facts and inf orma tion to p ersuade
potential c onsumers . The p eripheral route uses p ositiv e as sociation with cues such as b eauty, fame , and
positiv e emotions .
12.4 Conf ormity , Compliance, and Obedience
The p ower o f the situa tion c an le ad p eople to c onform , or g o along with the group , even in the fac e of
inac cura te inf orma tion . Conformity to group norms is driv en b y tw o motiv ations , the desire to fit in and b e
liked and the desire to b e ac cura te and g ain inf orma tion from the group . Authority figures also ha ve influenc e
over our b ehaviors , and man y people b ecome ob edient and f ollow orders ev en if the orders are c ontrar y to
their p ersonal v alues . Conformity to group pres sures c an also result in groupthink , or the fa ulty decision-
making pro cess tha t results from c ohesiv e group memb ers tr ying to maintain group harmon y. Group
situa tions c an impro ve human b ehavior through facilita ting p erformanc e on e asy tasks , but inhibiting
performanc e on difficult tasks . The presenc e of others c an also le ad to so cial lo afing when individual eff orts
cannot b e ev alua ted.
12.5 Prejudice and Discrimination
As div erse individuals , humans c an e xperienc e conflict when interacting with p eople who are diff erent from
each other . Prejudic e, or neg ative feelings and ev alua tions , is c ommon when p eople are from a diff erent so cial
group (i .e., out -group). N egative attitudes to ward out -groups c an le ad to discrimina tion . Prejudic e and
discrimina tion a gains t others c an b e based on g ender , rac e, ethnicity , social clas s, sexual orienta tion , or a
variety o f other so cial identities . In-group ’s who f eel thre atene d ma y blame the out -groups f or their plight , thus
using the out -group as a sc apegoat for their fr ustration .12 • Summar y439
12.6 Aggr ession
Aggres sion is seeking to c ause another p erson harm or p ain. Hos tile a ggres sion is motiv ated by feelings o f
anger with intent to c ause p ain, and ins trumental a ggres sion is motiv ated by achieving a g oal and do es not
necessarily in volve intent to c ause p ain B ullying is an interna tional public he alth c oncern tha t larg ely a ffects
the adolesc ent p opula tion . Bullying is rep eated behaviors tha t are intende d to inflict harm on the victim and
can tak e the f orm o f ph ysical, psychologic al, emotional , or so cial a buse . Bullying has neg ative mental he alth
conse quenc es for y outh including suicide . Cyb erbullying is a new er form o f bullying tha t tak es plac e in an
online en vironment where bullies c an remain anon ymous and victims are helples s to addres s the haras sment .
Despite the so cial norm o f helping others in nee d, when there are man y bystanders witnes sing an emerg ency ,
diffusion o f resp onsibility will le ad to a lo wer lik eliho od of an y one p erson helping .
12.7 Prosocial Behavior
Altruism is a pure f orm o f helping others out o f emp athy, which c an b e contras ted with eg oistic motiv ations f or
helping . Forming rela tionships with others is a nec essity f or so cial b eings . We typic ally f orm rela tionships with
people who are close to us in pro ximity and p eople with whom w e share similarities . We expect recipro city and
self-disclosure in our rela tionships . We also w ant to f orm rela tionships with p eople who are ph ysically
attractiv e, though s tandards f or a ttractiv enes s vary by culture and g ender . There are man y typ es o f love tha t
are determine d by various c ombina tions o f intimacy , passion , and c ommitment; c onsumma te lo ve, which is
the ide al form o f love, contains all three c omp onents . When determining sa tisfaction and whether to maintain
a rela tionship , individuals o ften use a so cial e xchang e appro ach and w eigh the c osts and b enefits o f forming
and maintaining a rela tionship .

The Historical Development of Industrial and Organiz ational Psychology
Indus trial and org aniza tional ps ycholog y had its origins in the e arly 20th c entur y. Sev eral influential e arly
psychologis ts studie d issues tha t today would b e categoriz ed as indus trial ps ycholog y: James C attell
(1860–1944), Hug o Müns terb erg (1863–1916), W alter Dill Sc ott (1869–1955), R obert Yerkes (1876–1956),
Walter Bingham (1880–1952), and Lillian Gilbreth (1878–1972). C attell, Müns terb erg, and Sc ott had b een
students o f Wilhelm W undt , the fa ther o f experimental ps ycholog y. Some o f these rese archers had b een
involved in w ork in the are a of indus trial ps ycholog y before W orld W ar I. C attell’s contribution to indus trial
psycholog y is larg ely reflecte d in his f ounding o f a ps ychologic al consulting c omp any, which is s till op erating
today called the P sychologic al Corporation , and in the ac complishments o f students a t Columbia in the are a of
indus trial ps ycholog y. In 1913, Müns terb erg publishe dPsycholog y and Indus trial Efficiency , which c overed
topics such as emplo yee selection , emplo yee training , and eff ectiv e adv ertising .
Scottwas one o f the firs t psychologis ts to apply ps ycholog y to adv ertising , mana gement , and p ersonnel
selection . In 1903, Sc ott publishe d tw o books: The Theor y of Advertising and Psycholog y of Advertising . The y
are the firs t books to describ e the use o f psycholog y in the busines s world . By 1911 he publishe d tw o more
books,Influencing Men in B usines sand Incre asing Human Efficiency in B usines s. In 1916 a newly f orme d
division in the C arnegie Ins titute o f Technolog y hire d Sc ott to c onduct applie d rese arch on emplo yee selection
(Katzell & A ustin, 1992).
The f ocus o f all this rese arch w as in wha t we no w kno w as indus trial ps ycholog y; it w as only la ter in the
centur y tha t the field o f org aniza tional ps ycholog y dev elop ed as an e xperimental scienc e (K atzell & A ustin,
1992). In addition to their ac ademic p ositions , these rese archers also w orked directly f or busines ses as
consultants .
When the Unite d Sta tes entere d W orld W ar I in A pril 1917, the w ork o f psychologis ts w orking in this discipline
expande d to include their c ontributions to militar y eff orts. At tha t time Y erkes w as the president o f the
25-year-old Americ an P sychologic al As sociation (AP A). The AP A is a pro fessional as sociation in the Unite d
States f or clinic al and rese arch ps ychologis ts. Today the AP A performs a numb er o f functions including
holding c onferenc es, accrediting univ ersity degree programs , and publishing scientific journals . Yerkes
organiz ed a group under the Surg eon General ’s Offic e (SG O) tha t dev elop ed metho ds for screening and
selecting enlis ted men . The y dev elop ed the Arm y Alpha tes t to me asure mental a bilities . The Arm y Beta tes t
was a non-v erbal form o f the tes t tha t was adminis tere d to illitera te and non-English-sp eaking dra ftees . Scott
and Bingham org aniz ed a group under the A djutant General ’s Offic e (A GO) with the g oal to dev elop selection
metho ds for o fficers. The y cre ated a c atalogue o f occup ational nee ds for the Arm y, essentially a job -description
system and a s ystem o f performanc e ra tings and o ccup ational skill tes ts for o fficers (K atzell & A ustin, 1992).
After the w ar, work on p ersonnel selection c ontinue d. For e xample , Millic ent P ond rese arche d the selection o f
factor y workers, comp aring the results o f pre -emplo yment tes ts with v arious indic ators o f job p erformanc e
(Vinchur & K opp es, 2014).
From 1929 to 1932 Elton Ma yo (1880–1949) and his c olleagues b egan a series o f studies a t a plant ne ar
Chic ago, Western Electric’ s Ha wthorne W orks ( Figure 13.4 ). This long-term project to ok indus trial ps ycholog y
beyond jus t emplo yee selection and plac ement to a s tudy o f more c omple x problems o f interp ersonal
rela tions , motiv ation , and org aniza tional dynamics . These s tudies mark the origin o f org aniza tional
psycholog y. The y began as rese arch into the eff ects o f the ph ysical w ork en vironment (e .g., lev el of lighting in a

In the 1930s , rese archers b egan to s tudy emplo yees’ f eelings a bout their jobs . Kurt Lewin also c onducte d
rese arch on the eff ects o f various le adership s tyles , team s tructure , and te am dynamics (K atzell & A ustin,
1992). Lewin is c onsidere d the f ounder o f social ps ycholog y and much o f his w ork and tha t of his s tudents
produced results tha t had imp ortant influenc es in org aniza tional ps ycholog y. Lewin and his s tudents’ rese arch
include d an imp ortant e arly s tudy tha t use d children to s tudy the eff ect o f leadership s tyle on a ggres sion ,
group dynamics , and sa tisfaction (Lewin , Lippit t, & White , 1939). Lewin w as also resp onsible f or c oining the
term group dynamics , and he w as in volved in s tudies o f group interactions , cooperation , comp etition , and
communic ation tha t bear on org aniza tional ps ycholog y.
Parallel to these s tudies in indus trial and org aniza tional ps ycholog y, the field o f human factors ps ycholog y was
also dev eloping . Frederick Taylor was an engineer who sa w tha t if one c ould re design the w orkplac e there
would b e an incre ase in b oth output f or the c omp any and w ages for the w orkers. In 1911 he put f orward his
theor y in a b ook title d,The P rinciples o f Scientific Mana gement (Figure 13.6 ). His b ook e xamines mana gement
theories , personnel selection and training , as w ell as the w ork itself, using time and motion s tudies . Taylor
argue d tha t the principle g oal of mana gement should b e to mak e the mos t mone y for the emplo yer, along with
the b est outc ome f or the emplo yee. He b eliev ed tha t the b est outc ome f or the emplo yee and mana gement
would b e achiev ed through training and dev elopment so tha t each emplo yee c ould pro vide the b est work. He
believ ed tha t by conducting time and motion s tudies f or b oth the org aniza tion and the emplo yee, the b est
interes ts of both w ere addres sed. Time -motion s tudies w ere metho ds aime d to impro ve work b y dividing
different typ es o f op erations into sections tha t could b e me asure d. These analy ses w ere use d to s tandardiz e
work and to check the efficiency o f people and e quipment .
Personnel selection is a pro cess use d by recr uiting p ersonnel within the c omp any to recr uit and select the b est
candida tes f or the job . Training ma y nee d to b e conducte d dep ending on wha t skills the hire d candida te has .
Often c omp anies will hire someone with the p ersonality tha t fits in with others but who ma y be lacking in
skills . Skills c an b e taught , but p ersonality c annot b e easily chang ed.

One o f the e xamples o f Taylor ’s theor y in action in volved workers handling he avy iron ing ots. Taylor sho wed
that the w orkers c ould b e more pro ductiv e by taking w ork res ts. This metho d of res t incre ased worker
productivity from 12.5 to 47.0 tons mo ved per da y with les s rep orted fatigue as w ell as incre ased wages for the
workers who w ere p aid b y the ton . At the same time , the c omp any’s cost was re duced from 9.2 c ents to 3.9
cents p er ton . Despite these incre ases in pro ductivity , Taylor ’s theor y rec eived a gre at deal of criticism a t the
time b ecause it w as b eliev ed tha t it w ould e xploit w orkers and re duce the numb er o f workers nee ded. Also

working , and tha t while a t work, a w orker w as inc apable o f this . Taylor ’s theor y was underpinne d by the notion
that a w orker w as fundamentally lazy and the g oal of Taylor ’s scientific mana gement appro ach w as to
maximiz e pro ductivity without much c oncern f or w orker w ell-b eing . His appro ach w as criticiz ed by unions
and those s ymp athetic to w orkers ( Van De W ater, 1997).
Gilbreth was another influential I-O ps ychologis t who s trove to find w ays to incre ase pro ductivity ( Figure 13.7 ).
Using time and motion s tudies , Gilbreth and her husb and , Frank , worked to mak e workers more efficient b y
reducing the numb er o f motions re quire d to p erform a task . She not only applie d these metho ds to indus try
but also to the home , office, shops , and other are as. She in vestigated emplo yee fa tigue and time mana gement
stres s and f ound man y emplo yees w ere motiv ated by mone y and job sa tisfaction . In 1914, Gilbreth wrote the
book title ,The P sycholog y of Mana gement: The F unction o f the Mind in Determining , Teaching , and Ins talling
Metho ds o f Least Waste, and she is kno wn as the mother o f mo dern mana gement . Some o f Gilbreth ’s
contributions are s till in use to day: you c an thank her f or the ide a to put shelv es inside on refrig erator do ors,
and she also c ame up with the c oncept o f using a f oot p edal to op erate the lid o f trash c an (Gilbreth , 1914,
1998; K opp es, 1997; Lanc aster, 2004). Gilbreth w as the firs t woman to join the Americ an So ciety o f Mechanic al
Engineers in 1926, and in 1966 she w as a warde d the Ho over Me dal o f the Americ an So ciety o f Civil Engineers .
Taylor and Gilbreth ’s work impro ved pro ductivity , but these inno vations also impro ved the fit b etween

saw gro wth in I-O ps ycholog y during W orld W ar II (McMillan , Stev ens, & K elloway, 2009). In the y ears a fter the

Concerns a bout the fairnes s of emplo yment tes ts arose , and the ethnic and g ender biases in v arious tes ts w ere

emplo yee motiv ation (K atzell & A ustin, 1992).
The rese arch and w ork o f I-O ps ychologis ts in the are as o f emplo yee selection , plac ement , and p erformanc e
appraisal b ecame incre asingly imp ortant in the 1960s . When C ongres s passed the 1964 Civil Rights A ct, Title13.1 • Wha t Is Indus trial and Or ganiza tional P sycholog y? 455

Then , org aniza tions mus t identif y the characteris tics o f applic ants f or a ma tch to the job analy sis. It also
involves training emplo yees from their firs t day on the job throughout their tenure within the org aniza tion ,
and appraising their p erformanc e along the w ay.
Selecting Employees
When y ou re ad job adv ertisements , do y ou ev er w onder ho w the c omp any comes up with the job description?
Often , this is done with the help o f I-O ps ychologis ts. There are tw o rela ted but diff erent appro aches to job
analy sis—you ma y be familiar with the results o f each as the y often app ear on the same job adv ertisement . The
first appro ach is task -oriente d and lis ts in detail the tasks tha t will b e performe d for the job . Each task is
typic ally ra ted on sc ales f or ho w fre quently it is p erforme d, how difficult it is , and ho w imp ortant it is to the job .
The sec ond appro ach is w orker-oriente d. This appro ach describ es the characteris tics re quire d of the w orker
to suc cessfully p erform the job . This sec ond appro ach has b een c alled job sp ecific ation (Dierdor ff & W ilson ,
2003). F or job sp ecific ation , the kno wledge, skills , and a bilities (KS As) tha t the job re quires are identifie d.
Obser vation , sur veys, and inter view s are use d to obtain the inf orma tion re quire d for b oth typ es o f job analy sis.
It is p ossible to obser ve someone who is pro ficient in a p osition and analyz e wha t skills are app arent . Another
appro ach use d is to inter view p eople presently holding tha t position , their p eers , and their sup ervisors to g et a
consensus o f wha t the y believ e are the re quirements o f the job .
How ac cura te and relia ble is a job analy sis? R esearch sugg ests tha t it c an dep end on the na ture o f the
descriptions and the sourc e for the job analy sis. For e xample , Dierdor ff & W ilson (2003) f ound tha t job

Candidate Analysis and T esting
Onc e a c omp any identifies p otential c andida tes f or a p osition , the c andida tes’ kno wledge, skills , and other
abilities mus t be ev alua ted and c omp ared with the job description . These ev alua tions c an in volve tes ting , an
inter view , and w ork samples or e xercises . You le arne d about p ersonality tes ts in the chapter on p ersonality; in
the I-O c onte xt, the y are use d to identif y the p ersonality characteris tics o f the c andida te in an eff ort to ma tch
those to p ersonality characteris tics tha t would ensure g ood performanc e on the job . For e xample , a high ra ting
of agree ablenes s might b e desira ble in a cus tomer supp ort position . Ho wever, it is not alw ays cle ar ho w best to
correla te p ersonality characteris tics with pre dictions o f job p erformanc e. It might b e tha t too high o f a sc ore on
agree ablenes s is actually a hindranc e in the cus tomer supp ort position . For e xample , if a cus tomer has a
misp erception a bout a pro duct or ser vice, agreeing with their misp erception will not ultima tely le ad to
resolution o f their c omplaint . An y use o f personality tes ts should b e ac comp anie d by a v erifie d as sessment o f
wha t scores on the tes t correla te with g ood performanc e (Ar thur , Woehr, & Graziano , 2001). Other typ es o f tes ts
that ma y be giv en to c andida tes include IQ tes ts, integrity tes ts, and ph ysical tes ts, such as dr ug tes ts or
physical fitnes s tes ts.
To better unders tand the hiring pro cess, let’s consider an e xample c ase. A c omp any determine d it had an op en
position and adv ertised it. The human resourc es (HR) mana ger directe d the hiring te am to s tart the
recr uitment pro cess. Imani sa w the adv ertisement and submit ted her résumé , which w ent into the c ollection
of candida te résumés . The HR te am review ed the c andida tes’ cre dentials and pro vide d a lis t of the b est
potential c andida tes to the dep artment mana ger, who re ache d out to them (including Imani) to set up
individual inter view s.
Using Cutoff Scor es to Determine Job Selection
Man y positions r equir e applicants t o tak e tests as par t of the selection pr ocess. These can include IQ t ests, job -
specific skil ls tests, or personality t ests. The or ganization ma y set cut off sc ores (i. e., a sc ore belo w which a
candidat e wil l not mo ve forward) for each t est to det ermine whether the applicant mo ves on t o the ne xt stage.
For example , ther e was a case o f Rober t Jor dan, a 49- year-old c ollege graduat e who applied f or a position with
the polic e force in Ne w London, Connecticut. As par t of the selection pr ocess, Jor dan t ook the W onderlic
Personnel T est (WPT ), a t est designed t o measur e cognitiv e ability .
Jordan did not mak e it t o the int erview stage because his WPT sc ore of 33, equiv alent t o an IQ sc ore of 125 (100
is the a verage IQ sc ore), w as too high. The Ne w London P olice depar tment policy is t o not int erview an yone who
has a WPT sc ore over 27 (equiv alent t o an IQ sc ore over 104) because the y belie ve an yone who sc ores higher
would be bor ed with polic e work. The a verage score for polic e officers nation wide is the equiv alent o f an IQ sc ore
of 104 ( Jordan v . New London , 2000; ABC Ne ws, 2000).
Jordan sued the polic e depar tment al leging that his r ejection w as discrimination and his civil rights w ere violat ed
because he w as denied equal pr otection under the la w. The 2nd U .S. Cir cuit Cour t of Appeals upheld a lo wer
court’s decision that the city o f Ne w London did not discriminat e ag ains t him because the same s tandar ds w ere
applied t o everyone who t ook the e xam ( The Ne w York Times , 1999).
What do y ou think? When might univ ersal cut off points mak e sense in a hiring decision, and when might the y
eliminat e other wise pot ential ly strong emplo yees?
Interviews
Mos t jobs f or mid-siz e to larg e-size busines ses in the Unite d Sta tes re quire a p ersonal inter view as a s tep in the
selection pro cess. Bec ause inter view s are c ommonly use d, the y ha ve been the subject o f considera ble rese arch
by indus trial ps ychologis ts. Inf orma tion deriv ed from job analy sis usually f orms the b asis f or the typ es o fWHA T DO Y OU THINK?458 13 • Indus trial -Organiza tional P sycholog y

ques tions ask ed. Inter view s can pro vide a more dynamic sourc e of inf orma tion a bout the c andida te than
standard tes ting me asures . Imp ortantly , social factors and b ody langua ge can influenc e the outc ome o f the
inter view . These include influenc es, such as the degree o f similarity o f the applic ant to the inter view er and
non verbal behaviors , such as hand g estures , head no dding , and smiling (B ye, Hor verak , Sandal , Sam , & V ivjer ,
2014; Rakić , Steff ens, & Mummende y, 2011).
There are tw o typ es o f inter view s: uns tructure d and s tructure d. In an uns tructure d inter view , the inter view er
may ask diff erent ques tions o f each diff erent c andida te. One c andida te might b e ask ed about her c areer g oals,
and another might b e ask ed about his previous w ork e xperienc e. In an uns tructure d inter view , the ques tions
are o ften , though not alw ays, unsp ecifie d beforehand . And in an uns tructure d inter view the resp onses to
ques tions ask ed are g enerally not sc ored using a s tandard s ystem . In a s tructure d inter view , the inter view er
asks the same ques tions o f every candida te, the ques tions are prep ared in adv ance, and the inter view er uses a
standardiz ed ra ting s ystem f or e ach resp onse . With this appro ach, the inter view er can ac cura tely c omp are tw o
candida tes’ inter view s. In a meta-analy sis o f studies e xamining the eff ectiv enes s of various typ es o f job
inter view s, McDaniel , Whetz el, Schmidt & Ma urer (1994) f ound tha t structure d inter view s were more eff ectiv e
at pre dicting subse quent job p erformanc e of the job c andida te.
Let’s return to our e xample c ase. For her firs t inter view , Imani w as inter view ed by a te am o f emplo yees a t the
comp any. She w as one o f five candida tes inter view ed tha t day for the p osition . Each inter view ee w as ask ed the
same lis t of ques tions , by the same p eople , so the inter view e xperienc e was as c onsis tent as p ossible acros s
applic ants . At the end o f the inter view s, the HR te am met and review ed the ans wers giv en b y Imani and the
other c andida tes. The HR te am then identifie d a f ew new qualifie d candida tes and c onducte d a new round o f
initial inter view s, while the firs t group o f potential hires w aite d to he ar b ack from the c omp any.
Preparing f or the Job Interview
You might be w ondering if ps ycholog y resear ch can t ell you ho w to suc ceed in a job int erview. As y ou can
imagine , mos t resear ch is c oncerned with the emplo yer’s int erest in choosing the mos t appr opriat e candidat e for
the job , a g oal that mak es sense f or the candidat e too. But suppose y ou ar e not the onl y qualified candidat e for
the job; is ther e a w ay to incr ease y our chanc es o f being hir ed? A limit ed amount o f resear ch has addr essed this
ques tion.
As y ou might e xpect, non verbal cues ar e impor tant in an int erview. Liden, Mar tin, & P arsons (1993) f ound that
lack o f eye contact and smiling on the par t of the applicant led t o lower applicant r atings . Studies o f impr ession
manag ement on the par t of an applicant ha ve sho wn that self-pr omotion beha viors g ener ally ha ve a positiv e
impact on int erviewers (Gilmor e & F erris , 1989). Diff erent personality types use diff erent f orms o f impr ession
manag ement, f or example e xtroverts use v erbal self-pr omotion, and applicants high in agr eeablenes s use non-
verbal methods such as smiling and e ye contact. Self-pr omotion w as mos t consis tently related with a positiv e
outcome f or the int erview, par ticularl y if it w as related to the candidat e’s person–job fit. Ho wever, it is pos sible t o
overdo self-pr omotion with e xperienc ed int erviewers (Ho ward & F erris , 1996). Barrick, Swider & St ewart (2010)
examined the eff ect o f firs t impr essions during the r appor t building that typical ly oc curs bef ore an int erview
begins . The y found that initial judgments b y int erviewers during this period w ere related to job o ffers and that the
judgments w ere about the candidat e’s compet ence and not jus t likability . Levine and F eldman (2002) look ed at
the influenc e of several non verbal beha viors in mock int erviews on candidat es’ lik ability and pr ojections o f
compet ence. Lik ability w as aff ected positiv ely by greater smiling beha vior. Int erestingl y, other beha viors aff ected
likability diff erently depending on the g ender o f the applicant. Men who displa yed higher e ye contact w ere les s
likable; w omen w ere mor e lik able when the y made gr eater eye contact. Ho wever, for this s tudy male applicants
were int erviewed b y men and f emale applicants w ere int erviewed b y women. In a s tudy carried out in a r eal
setting, DeGr oot & Gooty (2009) f ound that non verbal cues aff ected int erviewers’ as sessments aboutEVER YDAY CONNECTION13.2 • Indus trial P sycholog y: Selecting and Ev alua ting Emplo yees 459
candidat es. The y look ed at visual cues , which can o ften be modified b y the candidat e and v ocal (non verbal) cues ,
which ar e mor e difficul t to modif y. The y found that int erviewer judgment w as positiv ely aff ected b y visual and
vocal cues o f conscientiousnes s, visual and v ocal cues o f opennes s to experienc e, and v ocal cues o f
extroversion.
What is the tak e home mes sage from the limit ed resear ch that has been done? L earn t o be a ware of your
beha vior during an int erview. You can do this b y practicing and soliciting f eedback fr om mock int erviews. Pay
attention t o an y non verbal cues y ou ar e projecting and w ork at pr esenting non verbal cur es that pr oject
confidenc e and positiv e personality tr aits. And final ly, pay attention t o the firs t impr ession y ou ar e making as it
may also ha ve an impact in the int erview.
Training
Training is an imp ortant element o f suc cess and p erformanc e in man y jobs . Mos t jobs b egin with an
orienta tion p erio d during which the new emplo yee is pro vide d inf orma tion reg arding the c omp any his tory,
policies , and adminis trative proto cols such as time tracking , benefits , and rep orting re quirements . An
imp ortant g oal of orienta tion training is to e duc ate the new emplo yee a bout the org aniza tional culture , the
values , visions , hierarchies , norms and w ays the c omp any’s emplo yees interact —essentially ho w the
organiza tion is r un, how it op erates, and ho w it mak es decisions . There will also b e training tha t is sp ecific to
the job the individual w as hire d to do , or training during the individual ’s perio d of emplo yment tha t teaches
aspects o f new duties , or ho w to use new ph ysical or so ftware to ols. Much o f these kinds o f training will b e
formaliz ed for the emplo yee; f or e xample , orienta tion training is o ften ac complishe d using so ftware
presenta tions , group presenta tions b y memb ers o f the human resourc es dep artment or with p eople in the new
hire ’s dep artment ( Figure 13.9 ).
FIGURE 13.9 Training usual ly begins with an orientation period during which a ne w emplo yee learns about

Mentoring is a f orm o f inf ormal training in which an e xperienc ed emplo yee guides the w ork o f a new
emplo yee. In some situa tions , mentors will b e formally as signe d to a new emplo yee, while in others a
mentoring rela tionship ma y dev elop inf ormally .
Mentoring eff ects on the mentor and the emplo yee b eing mentore d, the protég é, have been s tudie d in rec ent
years. In a review o f mentoring s tudies , Eby, Allen , Evans, Ng, & DuBois (2008) f ound signific ant but small
effects o f mentoring on p erformanc e (i.e., behavioral outc omes), motiv ation and sa tisfaction , and actual c areer
outc omes . In a more detaile d review , Allen , Eby, Poteet , Lentz, & Lima (2004) f ound tha t mentoring p ositiv ely
affecte d a protég é’s comp ensa tion and numb er o f promotions c omp ared with non-mentore d emplo yees. In
addition , protég és w ere more sa tisfied with their c areers and had gre ater job sa tisfaction . All of the eff ects
were small but signific ant. Eby, Durle y, Evans, & Ra gins (2006) e xamine d mentoring eff ects on the mentor and460 13 • Indus trial -Organiza tional P sycholog y

found tha t mentoring w as as sociated with gre ater job sa tisfaction and org aniza tional c ommitment . Gentr y,
Weber, & Sadri (2008) f ound tha t mentoring w as p ositiv ely rela ted with p erformanc e ra tings b y sup ervisors .
Allen , Lentz, & Da y (2006) f ound in a c omp arison o f mentors and non-mentors tha t mentoring le d to gre ater
reported salaries and promotions .
Mentoring is rec ogniz ed to b e particularly imp ortant to the c areer suc cess of women (McK een & B ujaki , 2007)
by cre ating c onnections to inf ormal netw orks , reducing f eelings o f isola tion , and with o vercoming
discrimina tion in job promotions .
Researchers ha ve worked to unders tand the imp acts o f gender , rac e, and ethnicity on mentoring rela tionships ,
especially whether outc omes diff er b ased on the g ender or racial/ethnic mak eup o f the mentor -mentee p air.
Overall , women and memb ers o f underrepresente d racial/ethnic p opula tions do not lack ac cess to mentors ,
but the y do lack ac cess to mentors o f the same g ender , rac e, and ethnicity , because the senior roles in man y
organiza tions are made up o f White men (MLD C, 2010). R esults from these s tudies are mix ed, but g enerally
sugg est tha t pairings made up o f two people o f the same g ender or rac e/ethnicity ha ve better ps ychoso cial
outc omes , such as a f eeling o f more supp ort (Koberg, Bos s, & Go odman , 1998; A llen et al , 2006). On the other
hand , women and p eople o f color typic ally e xperienc e gre ater c areer adv ancement or higher p ay when
mentore d by people o f a diff erent g ender or rac e/ethnicity (P arks -Yancy , 2012).
A 2003 s tudy b y Ar thur , Bennet t, Edens , and Bell e xamine d multiple other s tudies to determine ho w eff ectiv e
organiza tional training is . Their results sho wed tha t training w as eff ectiv e, based on f our typ es o f
measurement: (1) the imme diate resp onse o f the emplo yee to the training eff ort, (2) tes ting a t the end o f
training to demons trate tha t learning outc omes w ere met , (3) b ehavioral me asurements o f job activities b y
supervisors , and (4) results such as pro ductivity and pro fits. The e xamine d studies represente d div erse f orms
of training including self -ins truction , lecture and discus sion , and c omputer as sisted training .
Evaluating Employees
Indus trial and org aniza tional ps ychologis ts are typic ally in volved in designing p erformanc e-appraisal s ystems
for org aniza tions . These s ystems are designe d to ev alua te whether e ach emplo yee is p erforming sa tisfactorily .
Indus trial and org aniza tional ps ychologis ts study , rese arch , and implement w ays to mak e work ev alua tions as
fair and p ositiv e as p ossible; the y also w ork to decre ase the subjectivity in volved with p erformanc e ra tings .
Fairly ev alua ted work helps emplo yees do their jobs b etter, impro ves the lik eliho od of people b eing in the right
jobs f or their talents , maintains fairnes s, and identifies c omp any and individual training nee ds. In our
example c ase, Imani w as o ffered the p osition and w as hire d with a 90- day prob ation p erio d. During tha t time ,
she met with her sup ervisor to discus s her p erformanc e and the e xpecta tions o f the p osition and her gro wth .
At the end o f the 90 da ys, it w as determine d tha t Imani w as meeting the e xpecta tions o f her emplo yer and had
passed her prob ationar y perio d. Imani w as e xcited to no w ha ve a p ermanent job .
Performanc e appraisals are typic ally do cumente d sev eral times a y ear, often with a f ormal pro cess and an
annual fac e-to-fac e brief meeting b etween an emplo yee and their sup ervisor . It is imp ortant tha t the original
job analy sis pla y a role in p erformanc e appraisal as w ell as an y goals tha t ha ve been set b y the emplo yee or b y
the emplo yee and sup ervisor . The meeting is o ften use d for the sup ervisor to c ommunic ate sp ecific c oncerns
about the emplo yee’s performanc e and to p ositiv ely reinf orce elements o f good performanc e. It ma y also b e
used to discus s sp ecific p erformanc e rew ards , such as a p ay incre ase, or c onse quenc es o f poor p erformanc e,
such as a prob ationar y perio d. Part of the function o f performanc e appraisals f or the org aniza tion is to
document p oor p erformanc e to b olster decisions to termina te an emplo yee.
Performanc e appraisals are b ecoming more c omple x pro cesses within org aniza tions and are o ften use d to
motiv ate emplo yees to impro ve performanc e and e xpand their are as o f comp etenc e, in addition to as sessing
their job p erformanc e. In this c apacity , performanc e appraisals c an b e use d to identif y opp ortunities f or
training or whether a p articular training program has b een suc cessful. One appro ach to p erformanc e
appraisal is c alled 360- degree f eedback appraisal ( Figure 13.10 ). In this s ystem , the emplo yee’s appraisal13.2 • Indus trial P sycholog y: Selecting and Ev alua ting Emplo yees 461
deriv es from a c ombina tion o f ratings b y sup ervisors , peers , emplo yees sup ervise d by the emplo yee, and from
the emplo yee herself. Oc casionally , outside obser vers ma y be use d as w ell, such as cus tomers . The purp ose o f
360- degree s ystem is to giv e the emplo yee (who ma y be a mana ger) and sup ervisor diff erent p ersp ectiv es o f
the emplo yee’s job p erformanc e; the s ystem should help emplo yees mak e impro vements through their o wn
efforts or through training . The s ystem is also use d in a traditional p erformanc e-appraisal c onte xt, pro viding
the sup ervisor with more inf orma tion with which to mak e decisions a bout the emplo yee’s position and
comp ensa tion ( Torno w, 1993a).
FIGURE 13.10 In a 360- degr ee per formanc e appr aisal , super visors , cus tomers , direct r epor ts, peers , and the

Few s tudies ha ve as sessed the eff ectiv enes s of 360- degree metho ds, but A tkins and W ood (2002) f ound tha t
the self and p eer ra tings w ere unrelia ble as an as sessment o f an emplo yee’s performanc e and tha t even
supervisors tende d to underra te emplo yees tha t gave themselv es mo dest feedback ra tings . Ho wever, a
different p ersp ectiv e sees this v aria bility in ra tings as a p ositiv e in tha t it pro vides f or gre ater le arning on the
part of the emplo yees as the y and their sup ervisor discus s the re asons f or the discrep ancies ( Torno w, 1993b).
In theor y, performanc e appraisals should b e an as set f or an org aniza tion wishing to achiev e its g oals, and mos t
emplo yees will actually solicit f eedback reg arding their jobs if it is not o ffered (DeNisi & Klug er, 2000).
However, in practic e, man y performanc e ev alua tions are dislik ed by org aniza tions , emplo yees, or b oth
(Fletcher , 2001), and f ew o f them ha ve been ade qua tely tes ted to see if the y do in fact impro ve performanc e or
motiv ate emplo yees (DeNisi & Klug er, 2000). One o f the re asons ev alua tions fail to ac complish their purp ose in
an org aniza tion is tha t performanc e appraisal s ystems are o ften use d inc orrectly or are o f an inappropria te
type for an org aniza tion ’s particular culture (Schrae der, Becton , & P ortis, 2007). An org aniza tion ’s culture is
how the org aniza tion is r un, how it op erates, and ho w it mak es decisions . It is b ased on the c ollectiv e values ,
hierarchies , and ho w individuals within the org aniza tion interact . Examining the eff ectiv enes s of performanc e
appraisal s ystems in p articular org aniza tions and the eff ectiv enes s of training f or the implementa tion o f the
performanc e appraisal s ystem is an activ e are a of rese arch in indus trial ps ycholog y (Fletcher , 2001).
Bias and Pr otections in Hiring
In an ide al hiring pro cess, an org aniza tion w ould g enera te a job analy sis tha t accura tely reflects the462 13 • Indus trial -Organiza tional P sycholog y

individual is to c arry out the job ’s requirements . For man y re asons , hiring decisions in the re al w orld are o ften
made b ased on factors other than ma tching a job analy sis to KS As. As mentione d earlier , inter view rankings
can b e influenc ed by other factors: similarity to the inter view er (B ye, Hor verak , Sandal , Sam , & V ijver, 2014)
and the regional ac cent o f the inter view ee (Rakić , Steff ens, & Mummende y 2011). A s tudy b y Ag erström &
Rooth (2011) e xamine d hiring mana gers’ decisions to in vite e qually qualifie d non-ob ese and ob ese job
applic ants to an inter view . The decisions o f the hiring mana gers w ere b ased on photographs o f the tw o
applic ants . The s tudy f ound tha t hiring mana gers tha t scored high on a tes t of neg ative as sociations with
overweight p eople displa yed a bias in fa vor o f inviting the e qually qualifie d non-ob ese applic ant but not
inviting the ob ese applic ant. The as sociation tes t me asures a utoma tic or sub conscious as sociations b etween
an individual ’s neg ative or p ositiv e values and , in this c ase, the b ody-size attribute . A meta-analy sis o f
experimental s tudies f ound tha t ph ysical attractiv enes s benefite d individuals in v arious job -rela ted outc omes
such as hiring , promotion , and p erformanc e review (Hoso da, Stone -Romero , & C oats, 2003). The y also f ound
that the s trength o f the b enefit app eared to b e decre asing with time b etween the la te 1970s and the la te 1990s .
Some hiring criteria ma y be rela ted to a p articular group an applic ant b elongs to and not individual a bilities .
Unles s memb ership in tha t group directly a ffects p otential job p erformanc e, a decision b ased on group
memb ership is discrimina tory (Figure 13.11 ). To comb at hiring discrimina tion , in the Unite d Sta tes there are

Title VII o f the Civil Rights A ct of 1964 mak es it illeg al to tre at individuals unfa vorably b ecause o f their rac e or
color o f their skin: An emplo yer cannot discrimina te based on skin c olor , hair te xture , or other immutable
characteris tics, which are traits o f an individual tha t are fundamental to their identity , in hiring , benefits ,
promotions , or termina tion o f emplo yees. The P regnancy Discrimina tion A ct of 1978 amends the Civil Rights
Act; it prohibits job (e .g., emplo yment , pay, and termina tion) discrimina tion o f a w oman b ecause she is
pregnant as long as she c an p erform the w ork re quire d.
The Supreme C ourt ruling in Griggs v . Duk e Power C o.made it illeg al under Title VII o f the Civil Rights A ct to
include e ducational re quirements in a job description (e .g., high scho ol diploma) tha t neg atively imp acts one
race over another if the re quirement c annot b e sho wn to b e directly rela ted to job p erformanc e. The EEO C

itself is illeg al. Only a small fraction o f these claims b ecome suits file d in a f ederal c ourt, although the suits
may represent the claims o f more than one p erson . In 2013, there w ere 148 suits file d in f ederal c ourts.

Base d on a 2020 Supreme C ourt ruling reg arding the applic ation o f the Civil Rights A ct, federal legisla tion no w
protects emplo yees in the priv ate sector from discrimina tion rela ted to se xual orienta tion and g ender identity .
These groups include lesbian , gay, bise xual , and trans gender individuals . There is evidenc e of discrimina tion
deriv ed from sur veys of workers, studies o f complaint filings , wage comp arison s tudies , and c ontrolle d job -
inter view s tudies (Badg ett, Sears, Lau, & Ho , 2009). P rior to the r uling , federal legisla tion protecte d federal
emplo yees from such discrimina tion; the Dis trict o f Columbia and 20 s tates ha ve laws protecting public and
priv ate emplo yees from discrimina tion f or se xual orienta tion (Americ an Civil Lib erties Union , n.d). Mos t of the
states with these la ws also protect a gains t discrimina tion b ased on g ender identity . Gender identity ref ers to
one’s sense o f being male , female , neither o f these , both o f these , or another g ender .
While the Supreme C ourt's Civil Rights A ct interpreta tion is reg arde d as a landmark outc ome f or L GBTQ
people , it will b e continually tes ted by org aniza tions tha t for v arious re asons see a nee d to e xclude L GBTQ
people from emplo yment or ser vice. The F irst Amendment protects religious org aniza tions from some asp ects
of anti-discrimina tion la ws, and some rec ent c ourt decisions ha ve expande d these e xceptions so tha t certain
minis tries , scho ols, or other org aniza tions c ould a void emplo ying or ser ving L GBTQ people .
Americans with Disabilities Act (AD A)
The Americ ans with Disabilit ies A ct (AD A)of 1990 s tates p eople ma y not b e discrimina ted agains t due to the

individual emplo yment w ould other wise viola te the la w. For e xample , there ma y be cases in which religion ,
national origin , age, and se x are b ona fide o ccup ational qualific ations . There are no BF OQ exceptions tha t
apply to rac e, although the firs t amendment protects ar tistic e xpres sions , such as films , in making rac e a

Sex or g ender is the mos t common re ason f or in voking a BF OQ as a def ense a gains t accusing an emplo yer o f

used in other typ es o f leg al cases f or determining whether a BF OQ exists. The firs t of these is whether all or
subs tantially all w omen w ould b e una ble to p erform a job . This is the re ason mos t ph ysical limita tions , such as
“able to lift 30 p ounds ,” fail as re asons to discrimina te because mos t women are a ble to lift this w eight . The
second tes t is the “ essenc e of the busines s” tes t, in which ha ving to cho ose the other g ender w ould undermine

accommo dations , such as re assigning s taff so tha t a w oman do es not ha ve to w ork in a men-only p art of a jail

Organiza tional ps ycholog y is the sec ond major branch o f study and practic e within the discipline o f indus trial
and org aniza tional ps ycholog y. Inorganiza tional ps ycholog y, the f ocus is on so cial interactions and their eff ect
on the individual and on the functioning o f the org aniza tion . In this section , you will le arn a bout the w ork
organiza tional ps ychologis ts ha ve done to unders tand job sa tisfaction , diff erent s tyles o f mana gement ,
different s tyles o f leadership , org aniza tional culture , and te amwork.
Job Satisf action
Some p eople lo ve their jobs , some p eople tolera te their jobs , and some p eople c annot s tand their jobs .Job
satisfaction describ es the degree to which individuals enjo y their job . It w as describ ed by Edwin Lo cke (1976)
as the s tate of feeling resulting from appraising one ’s job e xperienc es. While job sa tisfaction results from b oth
how w e think a bout our w ork (our c ognition) and ho w w e feel a bout our w ork (our a ffect) (Saari & J udg e, 2004),
it is describ ed in terms o f affect. Job sa tisfaction is imp acte d by the w ork itself, our p ersonality , and the culture
we come from and liv e in (Saari & J udg e, 2004).
Job sa tisfaction is typic ally me asure d after a chang e in an org aniza tion , such as a shift in the mana gement
model, to as sess ho w the chang e affects emplo yees. It ma y also b e routinely me asure d by an org aniza tion to
assess one o f man y factors e xpecte d to a ffect the org aniza tion ’s performanc e. In addition , polling c omp anies
like Gallup regularly me asure job sa tisfaction on a na tional sc ale to g ather bro ad inf orma tion on the s tate of
the ec onom y and the w orkf orce (Saad , 2012).
Job sa tisfaction is me asure d using ques tionnaires tha t emplo yees c omplete . Sometimes a single ques tion
might b e ask ed in a v ery straightf orward w ay to which emplo yees resp ond using a ra ting sc ale, such as a Lik ert
scale, which w as discus sed in the chapter on p ersonality . A Lik ert scale (typic ally) pro vides fiv e possible
answers to a s tatement or ques tion tha t allo ws resp ondents to indic ate their p ositiv e-to-neg ative strength o f
agreement or s trength o f feeling reg arding the ques tion or s tatement . Thus the p ossible resp onses to a
ques tion such as “Ho w sa tisfied are y ou with y our job to day?” might b e “Very sa tisfied,” “Somewha t satisfied,”
“Neither sa tisfied, nor dis satisfied,” “Somewha t dis satisfied,” and “ Very dis satisfied.” More c ommonly the
survey will ask a numb er o f ques tions a bout the emplo yee’s sa tisfaction to determine more precisely wh y the y
are sa tisfied or dis satisfied. Sometimes these sur veys are cre ated for sp ecific jobs; a t other times , the y are
designe d to apply to an y job . Job sa tisfaction c an b e me asure d at a glob al lev el, me aning ho w sa tisfied in
general the emplo yee is with w ork, or a t the lev el of specific factors intende d to me asure which asp ects o f the
job le ad to sa tisfaction ( Table 13.2 ).

Research has sugg ested tha t the w ork-content factor , which includes v ariety , difficulty lev el, and role clarity o f
the job , is the mos t strongly pre dictiv e factor o f overall job sa tisfaction (Saari & J udg e, 2004). In c ontras t, there
is only a w eak c orrela tion b etween p ay lev el and job sa tisfaction (J udg e, Pic colo, Podsak off, Sha w, & Rich ,
2010). J udg e et al . (2010) sugg est tha t individuals adjus t or adapt to higher p ay lev els: Higher p ay no long er
provides the sa tisfaction the individual ma y ha ve initially f elt when their salar y incre ased.
Why should w e care a bout job sa tisfaction? Or more sp ecific ally, wh y should an emplo yer care a bout job
satisfaction? Me asures o f job sa tisfaction are somewha t correla ted with job p erformanc e; in p articular , the y
app ear to rela te to org aniza tional citiz enship or discretionar y behaviors on the p art of an emplo yee tha t
further the g oals o f the org aniza tion (J udg e & K amme yer-Mueller , 2012). J ob sa tisfaction is rela ted to g eneral
life sa tisfaction , although there has b een limite d rese arch on ho w the tw o influenc e each other or whether
personality and cultural factors a ffect b oth job and g eneral lif e sa tisfaction . One c arefully c ontrolle d study
sugg ested tha t the rela tionship is recipro cal: J ob sa tisfaction a ffects lif e sa tisfaction p ositiv ely, and vic e versa
(Judg e & W atana be, 1993). Of c ourse , org aniza tions c annot c ontrol lif e sa tisfaction ’s influenc e on job
satisfaction . Job sa tisfaction , specific ally lo w job sa tisfaction , is also rela ted to withdra wal behaviors , such as
leaving a job or a bsenteeism (J udg e & K amme yer-Mueller , 2012). The rela tionship with turno ver itself,
however, is w eak (J udg e & K amme yer-Mueller , 2012). F inally , it app ears tha t job sa tisfaction is rela ted to
organiza tional p erformanc e, which sugg ests tha t implementing org aniza tional chang es to impro ve emplo yee
job sa tisfaction will impro ve org aniza tional p erformanc e (Judg e & K amme yer-Mueller , 2012).
There is opp ortunity f or more rese arch in the are a of job sa tisfaction . For e xample , Weiss (2002) sugg ests tha t
the c oncept o f job sa tisfaction me asurements ha ve combine d both emotional and c ognitiv e concepts , and
measurements w ould b e more relia ble and sho w better rela tionships with outc omes lik e performanc e if the

Jobstres saffects job sa tisfaction . Job s tres s, or job s train , is c aused by sp ecific s tres sors in an o ccup ation .
Stres s can b e an ambiguous term as it is use d in c ommon langua ge. Stres s is the p erception and resp onse o f
an individual to ev ents judg ed as o verwhelming or thre atening to the individual ’s well-b eing (Gyllens ten &
Palmer , 2005). The ev ents themselv es are the s tres sors . Stres s is a result o f an emplo yee’s perception tha t the
demands plac ed on them e xceed their a bility to meet them (Gyllens ten & P almer , 2005), such as ha ving to fill
multiple roles in a job or lif e in g eneral , workplac e role ambiguity , lack o f career progres s, lack o f job security ,
lack o f control o ver w ork outc omes , isola tion , work o verlo ad, discrimina tion , haras sment , and bullying
(Collig an & Higgins , 2005). The s tres sors are diff erent f or w omen than men and these diff erenc es are a
signific ant are a of rese arch (Gyllens ten & P almer , 2005). J ob s tres s leads to p oor emplo yee he alth , job
performanc e, and family lif e (Collig an & Higgins , 2005).
As alre ady mentione d, job insecurity c ontributes signific antly to job s tres s. Tw o incre asing thre ats to job
security are do wnsizing ev ents and c orporate merg ers. Busines ses typic ally in volve I-O ps ychologis ts in
planning f or, implementing , and mana ging these typ es o f org aniza tional chang e.
Downsizing is an incre asingly c ommon resp onse to a busines s’s pronounc ed failure to achiev e pro fit g oals,
and it in volves la ying o ff a signific ant p ercenta ge of the c omp any’s emplo yees. Indus trial-org aniza tional
psychologis ts ma y be involved in all asp ects o f downsizing: ho w the new s is deliv ered to emplo yees ( both those
being let g o and those s taying ), ho w laid-o ff emplo yees are supp orted (e.g., sep aration p acka ges), and ho w
retaine d emplo yees are supp orted. The la tter is imp ortant f or the org aniza tion b ecause do wnsizing ev ents
affect the retaine d emplo yee’s intent to quit , org aniza tional c ommitment , and job insecurity (U gboro, 2006).
In addition to do wnsizing as a w ay of resp onding to outside s trains on a busines s, corporations o ften gro w
larg er b y combining with other busines ses. This c an b e ac complishe d through a merg er (i .e., the joining o f two
organiza tions o f equal p ower and s tatus) or an ac quisition (i .e., one org aniza tion purchases the other). In an
acquisition , the purchasing org aniza tion is usually the more p owerful or dominant p artner . In b oth c ases ,
there is usually a duplic ation o f ser vices b etween the tw o comp anies , such as tw o ac counting dep artments and
two sales f orces. Both dep artments mus t be merg ed, which c ommonly in volves a re duction o f staff (Figure
13.14 ). This le ads to org aniza tional pro cesses and s tres ses similar to those tha t occur in do wnsizing ev ents .
Merg ers re quire determining ho w the org aniza tional culture will chang e, to which emplo yees also mus t adjus t
(van K nipp enb erg, van K nipp enb erg, Monden , & de Lima, 2002). There c an b e additional s tres s on w orkers as
they lose their c onnection to the old org aniza tion and tr y to mak e connections with the new c ombine d group
(Amiot , Terry, Jimmieson , & C allan , 2006). R esearch in this are a focuses on unders tanding emplo yee re actions13.3 • Or ganiza tional P sycholog y: The Social Dimension o f Work 469
and making practic al rec ommenda tions f or mana ging these org aniza tional chang es.

Work–Family Balance
Man y people juggle the demands o f work lif e with the demands o f their home lif e, whether it b e caring f or
children or taking c are o f an elderly p arent; this is kno wn as work-family b alanc e. We might c ommonly think
about w ork inter fering with family , but it is also the c ase tha t family resp onsibilities ma y conflict with w ork
oblig ations (C arlson , Kacmar , & W illiams , 2000). Greenha us and Beutell (1985) firs t identifie d three sourc es o f
work–family c onflicts:
•time dev oted to w ork mak es it difficult to fulfill re quirements o f family , or vic e versa,
•strain from p articip ation in w ork mak es it difficult to fulfill re quirements o f family , or vic e versa, and
•specific b ehaviors re quire d by work mak e it difficult to fulfill the re quirements o f family , or vic e versa.
Women o ften ha ve gre ater resp onsibility f or family demands , including home c are, child c are, and c aring f or
aging p arents , yet men in the Unite d Sta tes are incre asingly as suming a gre ater share o f domes tic
resp onsibilities . Ho wever, rese arch has do cumente d tha t women rep ort gre ater lev els o f stres s from
work–family c onflict (Gyllens ten & P almer , 2005).
There are man y ways to decre ase w ork–family c onflict and impro ve people ’s job sa tisfaction (P osig & Kick ul,
2004). These include supp ort in the home , which c an tak e various f orms: emotional ( listening ), practic al (help
with chores). W orkplac e supp ort can include unders tanding sup ervisors , flextime , leave with p ay, and
telec ommuting . Fle xtime usually in volves a re quirement o f core hours sp ent in the w orkplac e around which
the emplo yee ma y sche dule their arriv al and dep arture from w ork to meet family demands .Telec ommut ing
involves emplo yees w orking a t home and set ting their o wn hours , which allo ws them to w ork during diff erent
parts of the da y, and to sp end p art of the da y with their family; this ma y also b e kno wn as ec ommuting ,

Management and Organiz ational Structur e
A signific ant p ortion o f I-O rese arch f ocuses on mana gement and human rela tions . Douglas McGreg or (1960)
combine dscient ific mana gement (a theor y of mana gement tha t analyz es and s ynthesiz es w orkflo ws with the
main objectiv e of impro ving ec onomic efficiency , esp ecially la bor pro ductivity ) and human rela tions into the
notion o f leadership b ehavior . His theor y lays out tw o diff erent s tyles c alled Theor y X and Theor y Y. In the
Theor y X appro ach to mana gement , mana gers as sume tha t mos t people dislik e work and are not inna tely self -
directe d. Theor y X mana gers p erceive emplo yees as p eople who pref er to b e led and told which tasks to
perform and when . Their emplo yees ha ve to b e watche d carefully to b e sure tha t the y work hard enough to
fulfill the org aniza tion ’s goals. Theor y X w orkplac es will o ften ha ve emplo yees punch a clo ck when arriving
and le aving the w orkplac e: Tardines s is punishe d. Sup ervisors , not emplo yees, determine whether an
emplo yee nee ds to s tay late, and ev en this decision w ould re quire someone higher up in the c ommand chain to
appro ve the e xtra hours . Theor y X sup ervisors will ignore emplo yees’ sugg estions f or impro ved efficiency and
reprimand emplo yees f or sp eaking out o f order . These sup ervisors blame efficiency failures on individual
emplo yees ra ther than the s ystems or p olicies in plac e. Mana gerial g oals are achiev ed through a s ystem o f
punishments and thre ats ra ther than entic ements and rew ards . Mana gers are suspicious o f emplo yees’
motiv ations and alw ays susp ect selfish motiv ations f or their b ehavior a t work (e .g., being p aid is their sole
motiv ation f or w orking ).
In the Theor y Yappro ach, on the other hand , mana gers as sume tha t mos t people seek inner sa tisfaction and
fulfillment from their w ork. Emplo yees function b etter under le adership tha t allo ws them to p articip ate in , and
provide input a bout, set ting their p ersonal and w ork g oals. In Theor y Y w orkplac es, emplo yees p articip ate in
decisions a bout prioritizing tasks; the y ma y belong to te ams tha t, onc e giv en a g oal, decide themselv es ho w it
will b e ac complishe d. In such a w orkplac e, emplo yees are a ble to pro vide input on ma tters o f efficiency and
safety. One e xample o f Theor y Y in action is the p olicy o f Toyota pro duction lines tha t allo ws an y emplo yee to
stop the entire line if a def ect or other is sue app ears, so tha t the def ect c an b e fix ed and its c ause reme died
(Toyota Motor Manufacturing , 2013). A Theor y Y w orkplac e will also me aningfully c onsult emplo yees on an y
chang es to the w ork pro cess or mana gement s ystem . In addition , the org aniza tion will enc oura ge emplo yees to
contribute their o wn ide as. McGreg or (1960) characteriz ed Theor y X as the traditional metho d of mana gement
used in the Unite d Sta tes. He argue d tha t a Theor y Y appro ach w as nee ded to impro ve org aniza tional output
and the w ellb eing o f individuals .Table 13.3 summariz es ho w these tw o mana gement appro aches diff er.

TABLE 13.3
Another mana gement s tyle w as describ ed by Donald Clifton , who f ocuse d his rese arch on ho w an org aniza tion
can b est use an individual ’s strengths , an appro ach he c alled strengths -based mana gement . He and his
colleagues inter view ed 8,000 mana gers and c onclude d tha t it is imp ortant to f ocus on a p erson ’s strengths , not
their w eaknes ses. A s trength is a p articular enduring talent p ossessed by an individual tha t allo ws them to
provide c onsis tent , near-perfect p erformanc e in tasks in volving tha t talent . Clifton argue d tha t our s trengths
provide the gre atest opp ortunity f or gro wth (B uckingham & Clifton , 2001). An e xample o f a s trength is public
speaking or the a bility to plan a suc cessful ev ent. The s trengths -based appro ach is v ery popular although its
effect on org aniza tion p erformanc e is not w ell-s tudie d. Ho wever, Kaiser & O verfield (2011) f ound tha t
mana gers o ften neglecte d impro ving their w eaknes ses and o verused their s trengths , both o f which inter fered
with p erformanc e.
Leadership is an imp ortant element o f mana gement . Leadership s tyles ha ve been o f major interes t within I-O
rese arch , and rese archers ha ve prop osed numerous theories o f leadership . Bas s (1985) p opulariz ed and
develop ed the c oncepts o f transactional le adership v ersus trans forma tional le adership s tyles . Intransact ional
leadership , the f ocus is on sup ervision and org aniza tional g oals, which are achiev ed through a s ystem o f
rew ards and punishments (i .e., transactions). T ransactional le aders maintain the s tatus quo: The y are
mana gers. This is in c ontras t to the trans forma tional le ader . People who ha vetrans format ional le adership
possess four a ttributes to v arying degrees: The y are charisma tic ( highly lik ed role mo dels), inspira tional
(optimis tic a bout g oal attainment), intellectually s timula ting (enc oura ge critic al thinking and problem
solving ), and c onsidera te (Bas s, Avolio, & A twater, 1996).
As w omen incre asingly tak e on le adership roles in c orporations , ques tions ha ve arisen as to whether there are
differenc es in le adership s tyles b etween men and w omen (Ea gly, Johannesen-Schmidt , & v an Eng en, 2003).
Eagly & J ohnson (1990) c onducte d a meta-analy sis to e xamine g ender and le adership s tyle. The y found , to a
slight but signific ant degree , tha t women tend to practic e an interp ersonal s tyle o f leadership (i .e., she f ocuses
on the morale and w elfare o f the emplo yees) and men practic e a task -oriente d style (i .e., he f ocuses on
accomplishing tasks). Ho wever, the diff erenc es w ere les s pronounc ed when one lo oked only a t org aniza tional
studies and e xclude d laboratory experiments or sur veys tha t did not in volve actual org aniza tional le aders .
Larg er g ender -rela ted diff erenc es w ere obser ved when le adership s tyle w as c ategoriz ed as demo cratic or
autocratic, and these diff erenc es w ere c onsis tent acros s all typ es o f studies . The a uthors sugg est tha t
similarities b etween g enders in le adership s tyles are a ttributa ble to diff erent g enders nee ding to c onform to
the org aniza tion ’s culture; additionally , the y prop ose tha t gender -rela ted diff erenc es reflect inherent
differenc es in the s trengths e ach g ender brings to b ear on le adership practic e. In another meta-analy sis o f
leadership s tyle, Eagly, Johannesen-Schmidt , & v an Eng en (2003) f ound tha t women tende d to e xhibit the
characteris tics o f trans forma tional le aders , while men w ere more lik ely to b e transactional le aders . Ho wever,
the diff erenc es are not a bsolute; f or e xample , women w ere f ound to use metho ds o f rew ard f or p erformanc e
more o ften than men , which is a c omp onent o f transactional le adership . The diff erenc es the y found w ere472 13 • Indus trial -Organiza tional P sycholog y

rela tively small . As Ea gly, Johannesen-Schmidt , & v an Eng en (2003) p oint out , rese arch sho ws tha t
trans forma tional le adership appro aches are more eff ectiv e than transactional appro aches , although individual
leaders typic ally e xhibit elements o f both appro aches .
A new and emerging are a of rese arch within ps ycholog y focuses on le adership and the rela tionship with
leaders from the p ersp ectiv e of a follower. This “f ollowership ” rese arch sugg ests tha t studies nee d to e xamine
the le ader -follower rela tionship in b oth directions —ins tead o f focusing only on le adership —to b etter
unders tand the dynamics o f the rela tionship . Put diff erently , people are individuals , and b ecause the y are
different , there prob ably is no single b est leadership -follower dynamic b etween le aders and f ollowers. For
instanc e, think a bout the diff erenc es b etween y ourself and someone y ou kno w w ell. Do y ou resp ond the same
way to criticism? Ma ybe one o f you lik es a lot o f structure and other seems to w ork b est with les s structure .
Perhaps , one o f you is re ady to tr y a new res taurant a t an y time and the other pref ers to g o to the trie d-and-tr ue
plac e tha t you’ve visite d so man y times the ser vers kno w your order b efore y ou plac e it.
Some e arly rese arch has disc overed tha t the characteris tics o f individual f ollowers will result in diff erent typ es
of rela tionships with a le ader dep ending on the le adership s tyle. It app ears tha t not all le adership s tyles w ork
well with all f ollower typ es. One characteris tic o f followers, for e xample , is their degree o f extro version .
Previous rese arch sugg ests tha t individuals with a high degree o f extro version w ould nee d a larg er amount o f
interaction with their le aders in order to function w ell; ho wever, other rese arch sugg ests this ma y not
necessarily b e the c ase and ins tead other factors ma y be at work (Phillips & Be deian; Ba uer et al , 2006).
Another characteris tic o f followers is their individual nee d for gro wth . For followers who ha ve a s trong desire
to le arn and gro w within their org aniza tion , a le ader who pro vides dev elopmental opp ortunities might b e
better rec eived than one who do es not . In addition , for those f ollowers who are lo w on gro wth and nee d
strength , leaders who push them to gro w ma y mak e them les s sa tisfied followers as the y feel f orced into
further dev elopment and training , possibly signaling a lo wer lev el of achiev ement from their sup ervisor .
Training f or le aders in b oth helping emplo yees who ha ve a s trong driv e for gro wth and those who do not
app ears to b e helpful in impro ving the rela tionship b etween b oth typ es o f followers and their le aders (Sch yns,
Kroon, & Mo ors, 2008).
Finally , an emplo yee’s nee d for le adership is an imp ortant c omp onent o f the le ader -follower rela tionship .
Some individuals are signific antly more a utonomous than others and as a result do not resp ond as w ell to
leaders who pro vide a lot o f structure and rigidity o f pro cesses, in turn re ducing the quality o f their
rela tionship with their le ader . Other emplo yees who are high in nee d for le adership ha ve a b etter rela tionship
with their le ader if the y are pro vide d with a w ell-s tructure d en vironment with cle ar resp onsibilities and lit tle
ambiguity in their w ork. These f ollowers w ork b est in situa tions where the y feel the y can c omf ortably p erform
the w ork with lit tle re quirement to think outside o f the guidelines tha t ha ve been pro vide d. For these
individuals , having a le ader who is a ble to set a cle ar p ath forward f or the emplo yee with lit tle nee d for
devia tion promotes a s trong p ositiv e leader -follower rela tionship (F elfe & Sch yns, 2006).
Goals, T eamwork and W ork T eams
The w orkplac e today is rapidly changing due to a v ariety o f factors , such as shifts in technolog y, economics ,
foreign c omp etition , glob aliza tion , and w orkplac e demographics . Org aniza tions nee d to resp ond quickly to
chang es in these factors . Man y comp anies are resp onding to these chang es b y structuring their org aniza tions
so tha t work c an b e deleg ated to work te ams , which bring tog ether div erse skills , experienc e, and e xpertise.
This is in c ontras t to org aniza tional s tructures tha t ha ve individuals a t their b ase (N aquin & T ynan , 2003). In
the te am-b ased appro ach, teams are brought tog ether and giv en a sp ecific task or g oal to ac complish . Despite
their burg eoning p opularity , team s tructures do not alw ays deliv er gre ater pro ductivity —the w ork o f teams is
an activ e are a of rese arch (N aquin & T ynan , 2003).
Why do some te ams w ork w ell while others do not? There are man y contributing factors . For e xample , teams
can mask te am memb ers tha t are not w orking (i .e., so cial lo afing ). Teams c an b e inefficient due to p oor13.3 • Or ganiza tional P sycholog y: The Social Dimension o f Work 473
communic ation; the y can ha ve poor decision-making skills due to c onformity eff ects; and , the y can ha ve
conflict within the group . The p opularity o f teams ma y in p art result from the te am halo eff ect: T eams are
given cre dit f or their suc cesses. but individuals within a te am are blame d for te am failures (N aquin & T ynan ,
2003). One asp ect o f team div ersity is their g ender mix . Researchers ha ve explore d whether g ender mix has an
effect on te am p erformanc e. On the one hand , div ersity c an intro duce communic ation and interp ersonal-
rela tionship problems tha t hinder p erformanc e, but on the other hand div ersity c an also incre ase the te am’s
skill set , which ma y include skills tha t can actually impro ve team memb er interactions . Ho ogendo orn,
Oos terb eek, & v an P raag (2013) s tudie d project te ams in a univ ersity busines s scho ol in which the g ender mix
of the te ams w as manipula ted. The y found tha t gender -balanc ed teams p erforme d better, as me asure d by
sales and pro fits, than te ams made up mos tly b y men . The s tudy did not ha ve enough da ta to determine the
rela tive performanc e of teams with more w omen than men . The s tudy w as unsuc cessful in identif ying which
mechanism (interp ersonal rela tionships , learning , or skills mix es) ac counte d for p erformanc e impro vement .
There are three b asic typ es o f teams: problem resolution te ams , cre ative teams , and tactic al te ams . Problem
resolution te ams are cre ated for the purp ose o f solving a p articular problem or is sue; f or e xample , the
diagnos tic te ams a t the C enters f or Dise ase C ontrol . Creative teams are use d to dev elop inno vative possibilities
or solutions; f or e xample , design te ams f or c ar manufacturers cre ate new v ehicle mo dels . Tactic al te ams are
used to e xecute a w ell-define d plan or objectiv e, such as a p olice or FBI S WAT te am handling a hos tage
situa tion (Larson & LaF asto, 1989). One are a of activ e rese arch in volves a f ourth kind o f team—the vir tual
team; these s tudies e xamine ho w groups o f geographic ally disp arate p eople brought tog ether using digital
communic ations technolog y function (P owell, Pic coli, & Iv es, 2004). E ven b efore the C OVID-19 p andemic ,
virtual te ams w ere more c ommon due to the gro wing glob aliza tion o f org aniza tions and the use o f consulting
and p artnerships facilita ted by digital c ommunic ation .
Organiz ational Cultur e
Each c omp any and org aniza tion has an org aniza tional culture .Organizat ional culture encomp asses the
values , visions , hierarchies , norms , and interactions among its emplo yees. It is ho w an org aniza tion is r un,
how it op erates, and ho w it mak es decisions —the indus try in which the org aniza tion p articip ates ma y ha ve an
influenc e. Diff erent dep artments within one c omp any can dev elop their o wn sub culture within the
organiza tion ’s culture . Ostroff, Kinicki , and T amkins (2003) identif y three la yers in org aniza tional culture:
obser vable ar tifacts , esp ouse d values , and b asic as sumptions . Obser vable ar tifacts are the s ymb ols, langua ge
(jarg on, slang , and humor), narra tives (s tories and leg ends), and practic es (rituals) tha t represent the
underlying cultural as sumptions . Esp ouse d values are c oncepts or b eliefs tha t the mana gement or the entire
organiza tion endorses . The y are the r ules tha t allo w emplo yees to kno w which actions the y should tak e in
different situa tions and which inf orma tion the y should adhere to . These b asic as sumptions g enerally are
unobser vable and unques tione d. Researchers ha ve dev elop ed sur vey ins truments to me asure org aniza tional
culture .
With the w orkf orce being a glob al mark etplac e, your c omp any ma y ha ve a supplier in K orea and another in
Honduras and ha ve emplo yees in the Unite d Sta tes, China, and South Afric a. You ma y ha ve coworkers o f

Managing Gener ational Diff erences
An impor tant c onsider ation in managing emplo yees is ag e. Workers’ e xpectations and at titudes ar e de veloped in
part by experienc e in par ticular cul tural time periods . Gener ational c onstructs ar e some what arbitr ary, yet the y
may be help ful in set ting br oad dir ections t o organizational manag ement as one g ener ation lea ves the w orkf orce
and another ent ers it. The bab y boomer g ener ation (born betw een 1946 and 1964) is in the pr ocess of lea ving
the w orkf orce and wil l continue t o depar t it for a decade or mor e. Gener ation X (born betw een the earl y 1960s
and the 1980s) ar e no w in the middle o f their car eers . Mil lennials (born fr om 1979 t o the earl y 1994) beg an to
come o f age at the turn o f the c entur y, and ar e earl y in their car eers .
Today, as these thr ee diff erent g ener ations w ork side b y side in the w orkplac e, emplo yers and manag ers need t o
be able t o identif y their unique char acteristics. Each g ener ation has dis tinctiv e expectations , habits , attitudes ,
and motiv ations (Elmor e, 2010). One o f the major diff erences among these g ener ations is kno wledg e of the use
of technolog y in the w orkplac e. Mil lennials ar e technological ly sophis ticat ed and belie ve their use o f technolog y
sets them apar t from other g ener ations . The y ha ve also been char acterized as self-c entered and o verly self-
confident. Their at titudinal diff erences ha ve raised c oncerns f or manag ers about maintaining their motiv ation as
emplo yees and their ability t o int egrate int o organizational cul ture created b y bab y boomers (My ers &
Sadaghiani, 2010). F or example , mil lennials ma y expect t o hear that the y need t o pa y their dues in their jobs
from bab y boomers who belie ve the y paid their dues in their time . Yet mil lennials ma y resist doing so because
they value lif e outside o f work t o a gr eater degr ee (My ers & Sadaghiani, 2010). Meis ter & Wil lyerd (2010) sug gest
alternativ e appr oaches t o training and ment oring that wil l eng age mil lennials and adap t to their need f or
feedback fr om super visors: r everse ment oring , in which a y oung er emplo yee educat es a senior emplo yee in
social media or other digital r esour ces. The senior emplo yee then has the oppor tunity t o provide useful g uidanc e
within a les s demanding r ole.
Recruiting and r etaining mil lennials and Gener ation X emplo yees poses chal leng es that did not e xist in pr evious
gener ations . The c oncept of building a car eer with the c ompan y is not r elatable t o mos t Gener ation X emplo yees,
who do not e xpect t o stay with one emplo yer for their car eer. This e xpectation arises fr om o f a reduc ed sense o f
loyalty because the y do not e xpect their emplo yer to be lo yal to them (Gibson, Gr eenwood, & Murph y, 2009).
Retaining Gener ation X w orkers thus r elies on motiv ating them b y making their w ork meaningful (Gibson,
Greenwood, & Murph y, 2009). Sinc e mil lennials lack an inher ent lo yalty to the c ompan y, retaining them also
requir es eff ort in the f orm o f nur turing thr ough fr equent r ewards, praise , and f eedback.
Millennials ar e also int erested in ha ving man y choic es, including op tions in w ork scheduling , choic e of job duties ,
and so on. The y also e xpect mor e training and education fr om their emplo yers. Companies that o ffer the bes t
benefit pack age and br and at tract mil lennials (My ers & Sadaghiani, 2010).
One w ell-rec ogniz ed neg ative asp ect o f org aniza tional culture is a culture o fharas sment , including se xual
haras sment . Mos t org aniza tions o f an y siz e ha ve dev elop ed se xual haras sment p olicies tha t define se xual
haras sment (or haras sment in g eneral) and the pro cedures the org aniza tion has set in plac e to prev ent and
addres s it when it do es o ccur. Thus , in mos t jobs y ou ha ve held , you w ere prob ably made a ware o f the
comp any’s sexual haras sment p olicy and pro cedures , and ma y ha ve rec eived training rela ted to the p olicy . The
U.S. E qual Emplo yment Opp ortunity C ommis sion (n .d.) pro vides the f ollowing description o fsexual
haras sment :
Unwelcome se xual adv ances, reques ts for se xual fa vors, and other v erbal or ph ysical conduct o f a
sexual na ture c onstitute se xual haras sment when this c onduct e xplicitly or implicitly a ffects an
individual's emplo yment , unre asona bly inter feres with an individual's w ork p erformanc e, or cre ates
an intimida ting , hos tile, or o ffensiv e work en vironment . (par. 2)DIG DEEPER13.3 • Or ganiza tional P sycholog y: The Social Dimension o f Work 475
One f orm o f sexual haras sment is c alled quid pro quo . Quid pro quo me ans y ou giv e something to g et
something , and it ref ers to a situa tion in which org aniza tional rew ards are o ffered in e xchang e for se xual
favors. Quid pro quo haras sment is o ften b etween an emplo yee and a p erson with gre ater p ower in the
organiza tion . For e xample , a sup ervisor might re ques t an action , such as a kis s or a touch , in e xchang e for a
promotion , a p ositiv e performanc e review , or a p ay raise . Another f orm o f sexual haras sment is the thre at of
withholding a rew ard if a se xual re ques t is refuse d. Hos tile en vironment se xual haras sment is another typ e of
workplac e haras sment . In this situa tion , an emplo yee e xperienc es c onditions in the w orkplac e tha t are
considere d hos tile or intimida ting . For e xample , a w ork en vironment tha t allo ws offensiv e langua ge or jok es or
displa ys sexually e xplicit ima ges. Isola ted occurrenc es o f these ev ents do not c onstitute haras sment , but a
pattern o f rep eated occurrenc es do es. In addition to viola ting org aniza tional p olicies a gains t sexual
haras sment , these f orms o f haras sment are illeg al.
Haras sment do es not ha ve to b e se xual; it ma y be rela ted to an y of the protecte d clas ses in the s tatutes
regula ted by the EEO C: rac e, national origin , religion , or a ge.
Violence in the W orkplace
Workplac e violenc eis an y act or thre at of ph ysical violenc e, haras sment , intimida tion , or other thre atening ,
disr uptiv e behavior tha t occurs a t the w orkplac e. It rang es from thre ats and v erbal abuse to ph ysical as saults
and ev en homicide (Oc cup ational Sa fety & He alth A dminis tration , 2014).
There are diff erent targ ets o f workplac e violenc e: a p erson c ould c ommit violenc e agains t coworkers,
supervisors , or prop erty. Warning signs o ften prec ede such actions: intimida ting b ehavior , thre ats, sabotaging
equipment , or radic al chang es in a c oworker’s behavior . Often there is intimida tion and then esc alation tha t
leads to ev en fur ther esc alation . It is imp ortant f or emplo yees to in volve their imme diate sup ervisor if the y
ever feel intimida ted or unsa fe.
Murder is the sec ond le ading c ause o f death in the w orkplac e. It is also the primar y cause o f death for w omen
in the w orkplac e. Every year there are ne arly tw o million w orkers who are ph ysically as saulte d or thre atene d
with as sault. Man y are murdere d in domes tic violenc e situa tions b y boyfriends or husb ands who chose the
woman ’s workplac e to c ommit their crimes .
There are man y trigg ers f or w orkplac e violenc e. A signific ant trigg er is the f eeling o f being tre ated unfairly ,

LEARNING OBJEC TIVES
By the end o f this section, y ou wil l be able t o:
•Describe the field o f human fact ors ps ycholog y
•Explain the r ole o f human fact ors ps ycholog y in saf ety, productivity , and job satis faction
Human factors ps ycholog y (or erg onomics , a term tha t is fa vored in Europ e) is the third subject are a within
indus trial and org aniza tional ps ycholog y. This field is c oncerne d with the integra tion o f the human-machine
inter face in the w orkplac e, through design , and sp ecific ally with rese arching and designing machines tha t fit
human re quirements . The integra tion ma y be ph ysical or c ognitiv e, or a c ombina tion o f both. An yone who
needs to b e convinc ed tha t the field is nec essary nee d only tr y to op erate an unfamiliar television remote
control or use a new piec e of software f or the firs t time . Where as the tw o other are as o f I-O ps ycholog y focus on
the inter face between the w orker and te am, group , or org aniza tion , human factors ps ycholog y focuses on the
individual w orker’s interaction with a machine , work s tation , inf orma tion displa ys, and the lo cal en vironment ,
such as lighting . In the Unite d Sta tes, human factors ps ycholog y has origins in b oth ps ycholog y and
engineering; this is reflecte d in the e arly c ontributions o f Lillian Gilbreth (psychologis t and engineer) and her
husb and F rank Gilbreth (engineer).
Human factor pro fessionals are in volved in design from the b eginning o f a project , as is more c ommon in
software design projects , or to ward the end in tes ting and ev alua tion , as is more c ommon in traditional
indus tries (Ho well, 2003). Another imp ortant role o f human factor pro fessionals is in the dev elopment o f
regula tions and principles o f best design . These regula tions and principles are o ften rela ted to w ork sa fety. For
example , the Three Mile Island nucle ar ac cident le ad to Nucle ar R egula tory Commis sion (NR C) re quirements
for additional ins trumenta tion in nucle ar facilities to pro vide op erators with more critic al inf orma tion and
incre ased op erator training (Unite d Sta tes Nucle ar R egula tory Commis sion , 2013). The Americ an N ational
Standards Ins titute (ANSI, 2000), an indep endent dev elop er o f indus trial s tandards , dev elops man y standards
rela ted to erg onomic design , such as the design o f control-c enter w orks tations tha t are use d for transp ortation
control or indus trial pro cess control .
Man y of the c oncerns o f human factors ps ycholog y are rela ted to w orkplac e sa fety. These c oncerns c an b e
studie d to help prev ent w ork-rela ted injuries o f individual w orkers or those around them . Safety proto cols ma y
also b e rela ted to activities , such as c ommercial driving or flying , me dical pro cedures , and la w enf orcement ,
that ha ve the p otential to imp act the public .
One o f the metho ds use d to re duce ac cidents in the w orkplac e is a checklis t. The airline indus try is one
indus try tha t uses checklis ts. Pilots are re quire d to g o through a detaile d checklis t of the diff erent p arts of the
aircra ft before tak eoff to ensure tha t all es sential e quipment is w orking c orrectly . Astrona uts also g o through
checklis ts before tak eoff. The surgic al sa fety checklis t sho wn in Figure 13.15 was dev elop ed by the W orld
Health Org aniza tion ( WHO) and ser ves as the b asis f or man y checklis ts at me dical facilities .13.4 • Human F actors P sycholog y and W orkplac e Design 477
FIGURE 13.15 Checklis ts, such as the WHO sur gical checklis t sho wn her e, help r educ e workplac e ac cidents .
Safety c oncerns also le ad to limits to ho w long an op erator, such as a pilot or tr uck driv er, is allo wed to op erate
the e quipment . Recently the F ederal A viation A dminis tration (F AA) intro duced limits f or ho w long a pilot is
allowed to fly without an o vernight bre ak.

Summary
13.1 What Is Industrial and Organiz ational Psychology?
The field o f I-O ps ycholog y had its bir th in indus trial ps ycholog y and the use o f psychologic al concepts to aid in
personnel selection . Ho wever, with rese arch such as the Ha wthorne s tudy , it w as found tha t pro ductivity w as
affecte d more b y human interaction and not ph ysical factors; the field o f indus trial ps ycholog y expande d to
include org aniza tional ps ycholog y. Both W WI and W WII had a s trong influenc e on the dev elopment o f an
expansion o f indus trial ps ycholog y in the Unite d Sta tes and elsewhere: The tasks the ps ychologis ts w ere
assigne d led to dev elopment o f tes ts and rese arch in ho w the ps ychologic al concepts c ould as sist indus try and
other are as. This mo vement aide d in e xpanding indus trial ps ycholog y to include org aniza tional ps ycholog y.
13.2 Industrial Psychology : Selecting and Ev aluating Employees
Indus trial ps ycholog y studies the a ttributes o f jobs , applic ants o f those jobs , and metho ds for as sessing fit to a
job. These pro cedures include job analy sis, applic ant tes ting , and inter view s. It also s tudies and puts into plac e
procedures f or the orienta tion o f new emplo yees and ong oing training o f emplo yees. The pro cess of hiring
emplo yees c an b e vulnera ble to bias , which is illeg al, and indus trial ps ychologis ts mus t dev elop metho ds for
adhering to the la w in hiring . Performanc e appraisal s ystems are an activ e are a of rese arch and practic e in
indus trial ps ycholog y.
13.3 Organiz ational Psychology : The Social Dimension of W ork
Organiza tional ps ycholog y is c oncerne d with the eff ects o f interactions among p eople in the w orkplac e on the
emplo yees themselv es and on org aniza tional pro ductivity . Job sa tisfaction and its determinants and outc omes
are a major f ocus o f org aniza tional ps ycholog y rese arch and practic e. Org aniza tional ps ychologis ts ha ve also
studie d the eff ects o f mana gement s tyles and le adership s tyles on pro ductivity . In addition to the emplo yees
and mana gement , org aniza tional ps ycholog y also lo oks a t the org aniza tional culture and ho w tha t might a ffect
productivity . One asp ect o f org aniza tion culture is the prev ention and addres sing o f sexual and other f orms o f
haras sment in the w orkplac e. Sexual haras sment includes langua ge, behavior , or displa ys tha t cre ate a hos tile
environment; it also includes se xual fa vors re ques ted in e xchang e for w orkplac e rew ards (i .e., quid pro quo).
Indus trial-org aniza tional ps ycholog y has c onducte d extensiv e rese arch on the trigg ers and c auses o f
workplac e violenc e and sa fety. This ena bles the org aniza tion to es tablish pro cedures tha t can identif y these
trigg ers b efore the y become a problem .
13.4 Human F actors Psychology and W orkplace Design
Human factors ps ycholog y, or erg onomics , studies the inter face between w orkers and their machines and
physical en vironments . Human factors ps ychologis ts sp ecific ally seek to design machines to b etter supp ort
the w orkers using them . Psychologis ts ma y be involved in design o f work to ols such as so ftware, displa ys, or
machines from the b eginning o f the design pro cess or during the tes ting an alre ady dev elop ed pro duct .
Human factor ps ychologis ts are also in volved in the dev elopment o f best design rec ommenda tions and
regula tions . One imp ortant asp ect o f human factors ps ycholog y is enhancing w orker sa fety. Human factors
rese arch in volves eff orts to unders tand and impro ve interactions b etween technolog y systems and their
human op erators . Human–so ftware interactions are a larg e sector o f this rese arch .

LEARNING OBJEC TIVES
By the end o f this section, y ou wil l be able t o:
•Differentiat e betw een s timulus -based and r esponse -based definitions o f stress
•Define s tress as a pr ocess
•Differentiat e betw een g ood s tress and bad s tress
•Describe the earl y contributions o f Walter Cannon and Hans Sel ye to the s tress resear ch field
•Unders tand the ph ysiological basis o f stress and describe the g ener al adap tation s yndr ome
The term stres sas it rela tes to the human c ondition firs t emerg ed in scientific litera ture in the 1930s , but it did
not enter the p opular v ernacular until the 1970s (L yon, 2012). T oday, we often use the term lo osely in
describing a v ariety o f unple asant f eeling s tates; f or e xample , we often sa y we are s tres sed out when w e feel
frustrated, angr y, conflicte d, overwhelme d, or fa tigue d. Despite the widespre ad use o f the term , stres s is a
fairly v ague c oncept tha t is difficult to define with precision .
Researchers ha ve had a difficult time a greeing on an ac cepta ble definition o f stres s. Some ha ve conceptualiz ed
stres s as a demanding or thre atening ev ent or situa tion (e .g., a high-s tres s job , overcro wding , and long
commutes to w ork). Such c onceptualiza tions are kno wn as s timulus -based definitions b ecause the y
characteriz e stres s as a s timulus tha t causes c ertain re actions . Stimulus -based definitions o f stres s are
problema tic, however, because the y fail to rec ogniz e tha t people diff er in ho w the y view and re act to
challenging lif e ev ents and situa tions . For e xample , a c onscientious s tudent who has s tudie d dilig ently all
semes ter w ould lik ely e xperienc e les s stres s during final e xams w eek than w ould a les s resp onsible ,
unprep ared student .
Others ha ve conceptualiz ed stres s in w ays tha t emphasiz e the ph ysiologic al resp onses tha t occur when fac ed
with demanding or thre atening situa tions (e .g., incre ased arousal). These c onceptualiza tions are ref erre d to as
resp onse -based definitions b ecause the y describ e stres s as a resp onse to en vironmental c onditions . For
example , the endo crinologis t Hans Sely e, a famous s tres s rese archer , onc e define d stres s as the “resp onse o f
the b ody to an y demand , whether it is c aused by, or results in , ple asant or unple asant c onditions” (Sely e, 1976,
p. 74). Sely e’s definition o f stres s is resp onse -based in tha t it c onceptualiz es stres s chiefly in terms o f the
body’s ph ysiologic al re action to an y demand tha t is plac ed on it . Neither s timulus -based nor resp onse -based
definitions pro vide a c omplete definition o f stres s. Man y of the ph ysiologic al re actions tha t occur when fac ed
with demanding situa tions (e .g., ac celera ted he art rate) c an also o ccur in resp onse to things tha t mos t people
would not c onsider to b e genuinely s tres sful, such as rec eiving unanticip ated good new s: an une xpecte d
promotion or raise .
A useful w ay to c onceptualiz estres sis to view it as a pro cess whereb y an individual p erceives and resp onds to
events tha t the y appraise as o verwhelming or thre atening to their w ell-b eing (Lazar us & F olkman , 1984). A
critic al element o f this definition is tha t it emphasiz es the imp ortanc e of ho w w e appraise —tha t is,
judg e—demanding or thre atening ev ents (o ften ref erre d to as stres sors ); these appraisals , in turn , influenc e
our re actions to such ev ents . Tw o kinds o f appraisals o f a s tres sor are esp ecially imp ortant in this reg ard:
primar y and sec ondar y appraisals . Aprimar y appraisal involves judgment a bout the degree o f potential harm
or thre at to w ell-b eing tha t a s tres sor might entail . A s tres sor w ould lik ely b e appraise d as a thre at if one
anticip ates tha t it c ould le ad to some kind o f harm , los s, or other neg ative conse quenc e; conversely , a s tres sor
would lik ely b e appraise d as a challeng e if one b eliev es tha t it c arries the p otential f or g ain or p ersonal gro wth .
For e xample , an emplo yee who is promote d to a le adership p osition w ould lik ely p erceive the promotion as a
much gre ater thre at if the y believ ed the promotion w ould le ad to e xcessive work demands than if the y view ed
it as an opp ortunity to g ain new skills and gro w pro fessionally . Similarly , a c olleg e student on the cusp o f
gradua tion ma y fac e the chang e as a thre at or a challeng e (Figure 14.2 ).486 14 • S tress, Lifestyle, and Heal th

The p erception o f a thre at trigg ers a secondar y appraisal : judgment o f the options a vailable to c ope with a
stres sor, as w ell as p erceptions o f ho w eff ectiv e such options will b e (Lyon, 2012) ( Figure 14.3 ). As y ou ma y
recall from wha t you le arne d about self -effic acy, an individual ’s belief in their a bility to c omplete a task is
imp ortant (Bandura, 1994). A thre at tends to b e view ed as les s catastrophic if one b eliev es something c an b e
done a bout it (Lazar us & F olkman , 1984). Ima gine tha t two middle -aged people , Robin and Madhuri , perform
breast self -examina tions one morning and e ach notic es a lump on the lo wer region o f their left bre ast.
Although b oth view the bre ast lump as a p otential thre at (primar y appraisal), their sec ondar y appraisals diff er
considera bly. In c onsidering the bre ast lump , some o f the thoughts racing through R obin ’s mind are , “Oh m y
God, I could ha ve bre ast cancer! Wha t if the c ancer has spre ad to the res t of my body and I c annot rec over?
Wha t if I ha ve to g o through chemotherap y? I’ ve he ard tha t experienc e is a wful! Wha t if I ha ve to quit m y job?
My p artner and I w on’t ha ve enough mone y to p ay the mor tgage. Oh , this is jus t horrible …I c an’t deal with it!”
On the other hand , Madhuri thinks , “Hmm , this ma y not b e good. Although mos t times these things turn out to
be benign , I nee d to ha ve it check ed out . If it turns out to b e bre ast cancer, there are do ctors who c an tak e care
of it b ecause the me dical technolog y today is quite adv anced. I’ll ha ve a lot o f diff erent options , and I’ll b e jus t
fine .” Cle arly , Robin and Madhuri ha ve diff erent outlo oks on wha t might turn out to b e a v ery serious situa tion:
Robin seems to think tha t little c ould b e done a bout it , where as Madhuri b eliev es tha t, worst case sc enario , a
numb er o f options tha t are lik ely to b e eff ectiv e would b e available. As such , Robin w ould cle arly e xperienc e
greater s tres s than w ould Madhuri .14.1 • Wha t Is Stress? 487
FIGURE 14.3 When enc ount ering a s tressor, a person judg es its pot ential thr eat (primar y appr aisal) and then
determines if eff ectiv e op tions ar e available t o manag e the situation. Str ess is lik ely to resul t if a s tressor is
perceived as e xtremel y thr eatening or thr eatening with f ew or no eff ectiv e coping op tions a vailable .
To be sure , some s tres sors are inherently more s tres sful than others in tha t the y are more thre atening and
leave les s potential f or v aria tion in c ognitiv e appraisals (e .g., objectiv e thre ats to one ’s he alth or sa fety).
Nevertheles s, appraisal will s till pla y a role in a ugmenting or diminishing our re actions to such ev ents (E verly
& La ting , 2002).
If a p erson appraises an ev ent as harmful and b eliev es tha t the demands imp osed by the ev ent e xceed the
available resourc es to mana ge or adapt to it , the p erson will subjectiv ely e xperienc e a s tate of stres s. In
contras t, if one do es not appraise the same ev ent as harmful or thre atening , she is unlik ely to e xperienc e
stres s. According to this definition , environmental ev ents trigg er stres s reactions b y the w ay the y are
interprete d and the me anings the y are as signe d. In shor t, stres s is larg ely in the e ye of the b eholder: it ’s not so
much wha t happ ens to y ou as it is ho w you resp ond (Sely e, 1976).
Good Str ess?
Although s tres s carries a neg ative connota tion , at times it ma y be of some b enefit . Stres s can motiv ate us to do
things in our b est interes ts, such as s tudy f or e xams , visit the do ctor regularly , exercise , and p erform to the
best of our a bility a t work. Indee d, Sely e (1974) p ointe d out tha t not all s tres s is harmful . He argue d tha t stres s488 14 • S tress, Lifestyle, and Heal th

can sometimes b e a p ositiv e, motiv ating f orce tha t can impro ve the quality o f our liv es. This kind o f stres s,
which Sely e calledeustres s(from the Greek eu= “good”), is a g ood kind o f stres s as sociated with p ositiv e
feelings , optimal he alth , and p erformanc e. A mo dera te amount o f stres s can b e beneficial in challenging
situa tions . For e xample , athletes ma y be motiv ated and energiz ed by preg ame s tres s, and s tudents ma y
experienc e similar b eneficial s tres s before a major e xam . Indee d, rese arch sho ws tha t mo dera te stres s can
enhanc e both imme diate and dela yed rec all o f educ ational ma terial . Particip ants in one s tudy who memoriz ed
a scientific te xt p assage sho wed impro ved memor y of the p assage imme diately a fter e xposure to a mild
stres sor as w ell as one da y following e xposure to the s tres sor (Hupb ach & F ieman , 2012).
Incre asing one ’s lev el of stres s will c ause p erformanc e to chang e in a pre dicta ble w ay. As sho wn in Figure 14.4 ,
as s tres s incre ases , so do p erformanc e and g eneral w ell-b eing (eus tres s); when s tres s lev els re ach an optimal
level (the highes t point o f the cur ve), p erformanc e re aches its p eak. A p erson a t this s tres s lev el is c olloquially
at the top o f their g ame , me aning the y feel fully energiz ed, focuse d, and c an w ork with minimal eff ort and
maximum efficiency . But when s tres s exceeds this optimal lev el, it is no long er a p ositiv e force—it b ecomes
excessive and debilita ting , or wha t Sely e terme ddistres s(from the La tindis= “b ad”). P eople who re ach this
level of stres s feel burne d out; the y are fa tigue d, exhausted, and their p erformanc e begins to decline . If the
stres s remains e xcessive, health ma y begin to ero de as w ell (E verly & La ting , 2002). A g ood example o f dis tres s
is sev ere tes t anxiety . When s tudents are f eeling v ery stres sed about a tes t, neg ative emotions c ombine d with

FIGURE 14.4 As the s tress level incr eases fr om lo w to moder ate, so does per formanc e (eus tress). A t the op timal

The Pr evalence of Str ess
Stres s is ev erywhere and , as sho wn in Figure 14.5 , it has b een on the rise o ver the las t sev eral y ears. Each o f us

Stres s is an e xperienc e tha t evokes a v ariety o f resp onses , including those tha t are ph ysiologic al (e .g.,
accelera ted he art rate, headaches , or g astrointes tinal problems), c ognitiv e (e.g., difficulty c oncentra ting or

contributing to the onset and progres sion o f a v ariety o f ph ysical illnes ses and dise ases (C ohen & Herb ert,
1996).
The scientific s tudy o f ho w stres s and other ps ychologic al factors imp act he alth falls within the re alm o fhealth
psycholog y, a subfield o f psycholog y dev oted to unders tanding the imp ortanc e of psychologic al influenc es on

Early Contributions to the Study of Str ess
As previously s tated, scientific interes t in s tres s goes b ack ne arly a c entur y. One o f the e arly pioneers in the
study o f stres s was W alter Cannon , an eminent Americ an ph ysiologis t at Har vard Me dical Scho ol (Figure 14.7 ).
In the e arly p art of the 20th c entur y, Cannon w as the firs t to identif y the b ody’s ph ysiologic al re actions to
stres s.14.1 • Wha t Is Stress? 491
FIGURE 14.7 Harvard ph ysiologis t Walter Cannon firs t articulat ed and named the fight -or-flight r esponse , the
nervous s ystem’s sympathetic r esponse t o a significant s tressor.
Cannon and the Fight-or-Flight R esponse
Ima gine tha t you are hiking in the b eautiful mountains o f Colorado on a w arm and sunn y spring da y. At one
point during y our hik e, a larg e, frightening-lo oking black b ear app ears from b ehind a s tand o f trees and sits
about 50 y ards from y ou. The b ear notic es y ou, sits up , and b egins to lumb er in y our direction . In addition to
thinking , “This is definitely not g ood,” a c onstella tion o f ph ysiologic al re actions b egins to tak e plac e inside y ou.
Prompte d by a delug e of epinephrine (adrenaline) and norepinephrine (noradrenaline) from y our adrenal
glands , your pupils b egin to dila te. Your he art starts to p ound and sp eeds up , you b egin to bre athe he avily and
perspire , you g et but terflies in y our s tomach , and y our muscles b ecome tense , prep aring y ou to tak e some kind
of direct action . Cannon prop osed tha t this re action , which he c alled the fight -or-flight resp onse , occurs when
a person e xperienc es v ery strong emotions —especially those as sociated with a p erceived thre at (Cannon ,
1932). During the fight -or-flight resp onse , the b ody is rapidly arouse d by activ ation o f both the s ymp athetic
nervous s ystem and the endo crine s ystem ( Figure 14.8 ). This arousal helps prep are the p erson to either fight
or flee from a p erceived thre at.
FIGURE 14.8 Fight or flight is a ph ysiological r esponse t o a s tressor.
According to C annon , the fight -or-flight resp onse is a built -in mechanism tha t assists in maintaining492 14 • S tress, Lifestyle, and Heal th

homeos tasis —an internal en vironment in which ph ysiologic al varia bles such as blo od pres sure , respira tion ,
digestion , and temp erature are s tabiliz ed at lev els optimal f or sur vival. Thus , Cannon view ed the fight -or-flight
resp onse as adaptiv e because it ena bles p eople to adjus t internally and e xternally to thre ats in their
environment , allo wing them to c ontinue to b e aliv e and o vercome the thre at.
Selye and the Gener al Adaptation Syndr ome
Another imp ortant e arly c ontributor to the s tres s field w as Hans Sely e, mentione d earlier . He w ould ev entually
become one o f the w orld ’s foremos t experts in the s tudy o f stres s (Figure 14.9 ). As a y oung as sistant in the
biochemis try dep artment a t McGill Univ ersity in the 1930s , Sely e was eng aged in rese arch in volving se x
hormones in ra ts. Although he w as una ble to find an ans wer for wha t he w as initially rese arching , he
incidentally disc overed tha t when e xposed to prolong ed neg ative stimula tion (s tres sors)—such as e xtreme
cold, surgic al injur y, excessive muscular e xercise , and sho ck—the ra ts sho wed signs o f adrenal enlarg ement ,
thymus and lymph no de shrinka ge, and s tomach ulc eration . Sely e re alized tha t these resp onses w ere trigg ered
by a c oordina ted series o f ph ysiologic al re actions tha t unf old o ver time during c ontinue d exposure to a
stres sor. These ph ysiologic al re actions w ere nonsp ecific , which me ans tha t reg ardles s of the typ e of stres sor,
the same p attern o f reactions w ould o ccur. Wha t Sely e disc overed was the general adaptat ion syndrome , the
body’s nonsp ecific ph ysiologic al resp onse to s tres s.
FIGURE 14.9 Hans Sel ye specializ ed in r esear ch about s tress. In 2009, his nativ e Hung ary honor ed his w ork with
this s tamp , released in c onjunction with the 2nd annual W orld Conf erence on Str ess.
The g eneral adapta tion s yndrome , sho wn in Figure 14.10 , consis ts of three s tages: (1) alarm re action , (2) s tage
of resis tanc e, and (3) s tage of exhaustion (Sely e, 1936; 1976). Alarm re action describ es the b ody’s imme diate
reaction up on facing a thre atening situa tion or emerg ency , and it is roughly analog ous to the fight -or-flight
resp onse describ ed by Cannon . During an alarm re action , you are aler ted to a s tres sor, and y our b ody alarms
you with a c ascade o f ph ysiologic al re actions tha t pro vide y ou with the energ y to mana ge the situa tion . A
person who w akes up in the middle o f the night to disc over her house is on fire , for e xample , is e xperiencing an
alarm re action .

ultimat ely resul ts in e xhaus tion.14.1 • Wha t Is Stress? 493
If exposure to a s tres sor is prolong ed, the org anism will enter the stage of resis tanc e. During this s tage, the
initial sho ck o f alarm re action has w orn o ff and the b ody has adapte d to the s tres sor. Nevertheles s, the b ody
also remains on aler t and is prep ared to resp ond as it did during the alarm re action , although with les s
intensity . For e xample , supp ose a child who w ent mis sing is s till mis sing 72 hours la ter. Although the p arents
would ob viously remain e xtremely dis turb ed, the ma gnitude o f ph ysiologic al re actions w ould lik ely ha ve
diminishe d over the 72 inter vening hours due to some adapta tion to this ev ent.
If exposure to a s tres sor c ontinues o ver a long er p erio d of time , the stage of e xhaus tion ensues . At this s tage,
the p erson is no long er a ble to adapt to the s tres sor: the b ody’s ability to resis t becomes deplete d as ph ysical
wear tak es its toll on the b ody’s tis sues and org ans. As a result , illnes s, dise ase, and other p ermanent dama ge
to the b ody—even de ath—ma y occur. If a mis sing child s till remaine d mis sing a fter three months , the long-
term s tres s as sociated with this situa tion ma y cause a p arent to literally faint with e xhaustion a t some p oint or
even to dev elop a serious and irrev ersible illnes s.
In shor t, Sely e’s general adapta tion s yndrome sugg ests tha t stres sors tax the b ody via a three -phase
process—an initial jolt , subse quent re adjus tment , and a la ter depletion o f all ph ysical resourc es—tha t
ultima tely la ys the groundw ork f or serious he alth problems and ev en de ath. It should b e pointe d out , however,
that this mo del is a resp onse -based conceptualiza tion o f stres s, focusing e xclusiv ely on the b ody’s ph ysical
resp onses while larg ely ignoring ps ychologic al factors such as appraisal and interpreta tion o f thre ats.
Nevertheles s, Sely e’s mo del has had an enormous imp act on the field o f stres s because it o ffers a g eneral
explana tion f or ho w stres s can le ad to ph ysical dama ge and , thus , dise ase. As w e shall discus s later, prolong ed
or rep eated stres s has b een implic ated in dev elopment o f a numb er o f disorders such as h ypertension and
coronar y ar tery dise ase.
The Physiological Basis of Str ess
Wha t goes on inside our b odies when w e experienc e stres s? The ph ysiologic al mechanisms o f stres s are
extremely c omple x, but the y generally in volve the w ork o f two systems —the symp athetic ner vous s ystem and
the hypothalamic -pituitar y-adrenal (HP A) axis . When a p erson firs t perceives something as s tres sful (Sely e’s
alarm re action), the s ymp athetic ner vous s ystem trigg ers arousal via the rele ase o f adrenaline from the
adrenal glands . Release o f these hormones activ ates the fight -or-flight resp onses to s tres s, such as ac celera ted
heart rate and respira tion . At the same time , the HP A axis , which is primarily endo crine in na ture , becomes
especially activ e, although it w orks much more slo wly than the s ymp athetic ner vous s ystem . In resp onse to
stres s, the h ypothalamus (one o f the limbic s tructures in the brain) rele ases c orticotropin-rele asing factor , a
hormone tha t causes the pituitar y gland to rele ase adreno corticotropic hormone (A CTH) ( Figure 14.11 ). The
ACTH then activ ates the adrenal glands to secrete a numb er o f hormones into the blo odstream; an imp ortant
one is c ortisol , which c an a ffect vir tually ev ery org an within the b ody.Cortisol is commonly kno wn as a s tres s
hormone and helps pro vide tha t boost of energ y when w e firs t enc ounter a s tres sor, prep aring us to r un a way
or fight . Ho wever, sus taine d elev ated lev els o f cortisol w eaken the immune s ystem .494 14 • S tress, Lifestyle, and Heal th

FIGURE 14.11 This diagr am sho ws the functioning o f the h ypothalamic-pituitar y-adr enal (HP A) axis . The
hypothalamus activ ates the pituitar y gland, which in turn activ ates the adr enal glands , incr easing their secr etion o f
cortisol .
In shor t burs ts, this pro cess can ha ve some fa vorable eff ects , such as pro viding e xtra energ y, impro ving
immune s ystem functioning temp orarily , and decre asing p ain sensitivity . Ho wever, extende d rele ase o f
cortisol—as w ould happ en with prolong ed or chronic s tres s—often c omes a t a high pric e. High lev els o f cortisol
have been sho wn to pro duce a numb er o f harmful eff ects . For e xample , incre ases in c ortisol c an signific antly
weaken our immune s ystem (Glaser & Kiec olt-Glaser , 2005), and high lev els are fre quently obser ved among
depres sed individuals (Geo ffroy, Her tzman , Li, & P ower, 2013). In summar y, a s tres sful ev ent c auses a v ariety
of ph ysiologic al re actions tha t activ ate the adrenal glands , which in turn rele ase epinephrine , norepinephrine ,
and c ortisol . These hormones a ffect a numb er o f bodily pro cesses in w ays tha t prep are the s tres sed person to
take direct action , but also in w ays tha t ma y heighten the p otential f or illnes s.
When s tres s is e xtreme or chronic , it c an ha ve pro foundly neg ative conse quenc es. For e xample , stres s often
contributes to the dev elopment o f certain ps ychologic al disorders , including p ost-trauma tic s tres s disorder ,
major depres sive disorder , and other serious ps ychia tric c onditions . Additionally , we note d earlier tha t stres s

The y can include major tra uma tic ev ents , signific ant lif e chang es, daily has sles , as w ell as other situa tions in

Traumatic Events
Some s tres sors in volve tra uma tic ev ents or situa tions in which a p erson is e xposed to actual or thre atene d

In the 1960s , psychia trists Thomas Holmes and Richard Rahe wante d to e xamine the link b etween lif e
stres sors and ph ysical illnes s, based on the h ypothesis tha t life ev ents re quiring signific ant chang es in a
person ’s normal lif e routines are s tres sful, whether these ev ents are desira ble or undesira ble. The y dev elop ed
the Social R eadjus tment Rat ing Sc ale (SRRS ), consis ting o f 43 lif e ev ents tha t require v arying degrees o f
personal re adjus tment (Holmes & Rahe , 1967). Man y life ev ents tha t mos t people w ould c onsider ple asant
(e.g., holida ys, retirement , marria ge) are among those lis ted on the SRRS; these are e xamples o f eus tres s.
Holmes and Rahe also prop osed tha t life ev ents c an add up o ver time , and tha t experiencing a clus ter o f
stres sful ev ents incre ases one ’s risk o f dev eloping ph ysical illnes ses.
In dev eloping their sc ale, Holmes and Rahe ask ed 394 p articip ants to pro vide a numeric al es tima te for e ach o f
the 43 items; e ach es tima te corresp onde d to ho w much re adjus tment p articip ants f elt e ach ev ent w ould
require . These es tima tes resulte d in me an v alue sc ores f or e ach ev ent—often c alled lif e chang e units (L CUs)
(Rahe , McK een, & Ar thur , 1967). The numeric al sc ores rang ed from 11 to 100, representing the p erceived
magnitude o f life chang e each ev ent entails . De ath o f a sp ouse rank ed highes t on the sc ale with 100 L CUs, and
divorce rank ed sec ond highes t with 73 L CUs. In addition , personal injur y or illnes s, marria ge, and job
termina tion also rank ed highly on the sc ale with 53, 50, and 47 L CUs, resp ectiv ely. Conversely , chang e in
residenc e (20 L CUs), chang e in e ating ha bits (15 L CUs), and v acation (13 L CUs) rank ed low on the sc ale ( Table

Extensiv e rese arch has demons trated tha t accumula ting a high numb er o f life chang e units within a brief
perio d of time (one or tw o years) is rela ted to a wide rang e of ph ysical illnes ses (ev en ac cidents and a thletic
injuries) and mental he alth problems (Mona t & Lazar us, 1991; Scully , Tosi, & Banning , 2000). In an e arly
demons tration , rese archers obtaine d LCU sc ores f or U .S. and N orwegian N avy personnel who w ere a bout to
emb ark on a six -month v oyage. A la ter e xamina tion o f me dical rec ords rev ealed positiv e (but small)
correla tions b etween L CU sc ores prior to the v oyage and subse quent illnes s symptoms during the ensuing six -
month journe y (Rahe , 1974). In addition , people tend to e xperienc e more ph ysical symptoms , such as
backache , upset s tomach , diarrhe a, and acne , on sp ecific da ys in which self -rep orted LCU v alues are
considera bly higher than normal , such as the da y of a family memb er’s wedding (Holmes & Holmes , 1970).
The So cial R eadjus tment Ra ting Sc ale (SRRS ) pro vides rese archers a simple , easy-to-adminis ter w ay of
assessing the amount o f stres s in p eople ’s liv es, and it has b een use d in hundre ds o f studies ( Thoits , 2010).
Despite its widespre ad use , the sc ale has b een subject to criticism . First, man y of the items on the SRRS are
vague; f or e xample , death o f a close friend c ould in volve the de ath o f a long-a bsent childho od friend tha t
requires lit tle so cial re adjus tment (Dohren wend , 2006). In addition , some ha ve challeng ed its as sumption tha t
undesira ble lif e ev ents are no more s tres sful than desira ble ones (Derog atis & C oons, 1993). Ho wever, mos t of
the a vailable evidenc e sugg ests tha t, at least as far as mental he alth is c oncerne d, undesira ble or neg ative
events are more s trongly as sociated with p oor outc omes (such as depres sion) than are desira ble, positiv e
events (Ha tch & Dohren wend , 2007). P erhaps the mos t serious criticism is tha t the sc ale do es not tak e into
considera tion resp ondents’ appraisals o f the lif e ev ents it c ontains . As y ou rec all, appraisal o f a s tres sor is a
key element in the c onceptualiza tion and o verall e xperienc e of stres s. Being fire d from w ork ma y be
devastating to some but a w elcome opp ortunity to obtain a b etter job f or others . The SRRS remains one o f the
mos t well-kno wn ins truments in the s tudy o f stres s, and it is a useful to ol for identif ying p otential s tres s-
rela ted he alth outc omes (Scully et al ., 2000).

OCCUP ATION-RELA TED Str essors
Stres sors c an include situa tions in which one is fre quently e xposed to challenging and unple asant ev ents ,
such as difficult , demanding , or unsa fe working c onditions . Although mos t jobs and o ccup ations c an a t times
be demanding , some are cle arly more s tres sful than others ( Figure 14.14 ). For e xample , mos t people w ould
likely a gree tha t a firefighter ’s work is inherently more s tres sful than tha t of a floris t. Equally lik ely, mos t would

Some p eople who are e xposed to chronic ally s tres sful w ork c onditions c an e xperienc ejob burnout , which is a
general sense o f emotional e xhaustion and cynicism in rela tion to one ’s job (Maslach & J ackson , 1981). J ob
burnout o ccurs fre quently among those in human ser vice jobs (e .g., so cial w orkers, teachers , therapis ts, and
police officers). J ob burnout c onsis ts of three dimensions . The firs t dimension is e xhaustion—a sense tha t
one’s emotional resourc es are draine d or tha t one is a t the end o f their rop e and has nothing more to giv e at a
psychologic al lev el. Sec ond , job burnout is characteriz ed by dep ersonaliza tion: a sense o f emotional
detachment b etween the w orker and the recipients o f their ser vices, often resulting in c allous , cynic al, or
indiff erent a ttitudes to ward these individuals . Third , job burnout is characteriz ed by diminishe d personal
accomplishment , which is the tendency to ev alua te one ’s work neg atively b y, for e xample , experiencing
dissatisfaction with one ’s job -rela ted ac complishments or f eeling as though one has c ategoric ally faile d to
influenc e others’ liv es through one ’s work.
Job s train app ears to b e one o f the gre atest risk factors le ading to job burnout , which is mos t commonly

alcohol c onsumption , physical inactivity , being o verweight , and ha ving a ph ysical or lif etime mental disorder
are also as sociated with job burnout (A hola, et al ., 2006). In addition , depres sion o ften c o-occurs with job
burnout . One larg e-scale s tudy o f over 3,000 F innish emplo yees rep orted tha t half o f the p articip ants with
severe job burnout had some f orm o f depres sive disorder (A hola et al ., 2005). J ob burnout is o ften precipita ted
by feelings o f having in vested considera ble energ y, effort, and time into one ’s work while rec eiving lit tle in
return (e .g., little resp ect or supp ort from others or lo w pay) (Tatris, Peeters , Le Blanc , Schreurs , & Scha ufeli,

Social Status, Str ess, and Health Car e
Psychologis ts ha ve long been a ware that social s tatus (e .g., wealth, privileg e) is intimat ely tied t o stress, heal th,
and w ell-being . Some fact ors that c ontribut e to high s tress and poor heal th among people with lo wer social
status include lack o f contr ol and pr edictability (e .g., greater unemplo yment) and r esour ce inequality (e .g., les s
access to heal th car e and other c ommunity r esour ces) (Marmot & Sapolsky , 2014).
In the Unit ed Stat es, resour ce inequalities tied t o social s tatus o ften cr eate race and g ender diff erences in heal th
care. For example , African American w omen ha ve the highes t rates o f emer gency r oom visits and unmet heal th

lack o f unders tanding , and insensitivity among heal th car e professionals (Haf eez, Zeshan, T ahir, Jahan, &

Stress and the Immune System
In a sense , the immune sy stem is the b ody’s sur veillanc e system . It c onsis ts of a v ariety o f structures , cells,
and mechanisms tha t ser ve to protect the b ody from in vading micro organisms tha t can harm or dama ge the
body’s tis sues and org ans. When the immune s ystem is w orking as it should , it k eeps us he alth y and dise ase

Immune System Err ors
Sometimes , the immune s ystem will function erroneously . For e xample , sometimes it c an g o awry by

In addition , the immune s ystem ma y sometimes bre ak do wn and b e una ble to do its job . This situa tion is

For e xample , acquire d immune deficiency s yndrome (AIDS ) is a serious and lethal dise ase tha t is c aused by

Stressors and Immune Function
The ques tion o f whether s tres s and neg ative emotional s tates c an influenc e immune function has c aptiv ated
rese archers f or o ver three dec ades , and disc overies made o ver tha t time ha ve drama tically chang ed the fac e of
health ps ycholog y (Kiec olt-Glaser , 2009). Psychoneuroimmunolog yis the field tha t studies ho w ps ychologic al
factors such as s tres s influenc e the immune s ystem and immune functioning . The term
psychoneuroimmunolog y was firs t coine d in 1981, when it app eared as the title o f a b ook tha t review ed
available evidenc e for as sociations b etween the brain , endo crine s ystem , and immune s ystem (Zacharie ,
2009). T o a larg e extent , this field ev olved from the disc overy tha t there is a c onnection b etween the c entral
nervous s ystem and the immune s ystem .
Some o f the mos t comp elling evidenc e for a c onnection b etween the brain and the immune s ystem c omes
from s tudies in which rese archers demons trated tha t immune resp onses in animals c ould b e clas sically
conditione d (E verly & La ting , 2002). F or e xample , Ader and C ohen (1975) p aire d fla vored water (the
conditione d stimulus) with the presenta tion o f an immunosuppres sive dr ug (the unc onditione d stimulus),
causing sicknes s (an unc onditione d resp onse). N ot surprisingly , rats exposed to this p airing dev elop ed a
conditione d aversion to the fla vored water. Ho wever, the tas te of the w ater itself la ter pro duced
immunosuppres sion (a c onditione d resp onse), indic ating tha t the immune s ystem itself had b een c onditione d.
Man y subse quent s tudies o ver the y ears ha ve fur ther demons trated tha t immune resp onses c an b e clas sically
conditione d in b oth animals and humans (A der & C ohen , 2001). Thus , if clas sical conditioning c an alter
immunity , other ps ychologic al factors should b e capable o f altering it as w ell.
Hundre ds o f studies in volving tens o f thousands o f particip ants ha ve tes ted man y kinds o f brief and chronic
stres sors and their eff ects on the immune s ystem (e .g., public sp eaking , me dical scho ol examina tions ,
unemplo yment , marital disc ord, div orce, death o f spouse , burnout and job s train , caring f or a rela tive with
Alzheimer ’s dise ase, and e xposure to the harsh clima te of Antarctic a). It has b een rep eatedly demons trated
that man y kinds o f stres sors are as sociated with p oor or w eakened immune functioning (Glaser & Kiec olt-
Glaser , 2005; Kiec olt-Glaser , McGuire , Robles , & Glaser , 2002; Seg erstrom & Miller , 2004).
When ev alua ting these findings , it is imp ortant to rememb er tha t there is a tangible ph ysiologic al connection
between the brain and the immune s ystem . For e xample , the s ymp athetic ner vous s ystem inner vates immune
organs such as the th ymus , bone marro w, spleen , and ev en lymph no des (Maier , Watkins , & Fleshner , 1994).

(Everly & La ting , 2002).
Some o f the more drama tic e xamples demons trating the link b etween s tres s and imp aire d immune function
involve studies in which v olunteers w ere e xposed to vir uses . The ra tionale b ehind this rese arch is tha t because
stres s weakens the immune s ystem , people with high s tres s lev els should b e more lik ely to dev elop an illnes s
comp ared to those under lit tle s tres s. In one memora ble e xperiment using this metho d, rese archers

anybody w ould ev er w ant to p articip ate in a s tudy in which the y are subjecte d to such tre atment , the

chronic s tres sors f or more than one month— especially enduring difficulties in volving w ork or

In another s tudy , older v olunteers w ere giv en an influenza vir us v accina tion . Comp ared to c ontrols , those who

Other s tudies ha ve demons trated tha t stres s slo ws do wn w ound he aling b y imp airing immune resp onses

Stress and Aging: A T ale of T elomer es
Have you e ver w onder ed wh y people who ar e stressed o ften seem t o ha ve a hag gard look about them? A
pioneering s tudy fr om 2004 sug gests that the r eason is because s tress can actual ly accelerate the c ell biolog y of
aging .
Stress, it seems , can shor ten telomer es, which ar e segments o f DNA that pr otect the ends o f chr omosomes .DIG DEEPER14.3 • S tress and Il lnes s505
Shor tened t elomer es can inhibit or block c ell division, which includes gr owth and pr oliferation o f new cells,
ther eby leading t o mor e rapid aging (Sapolsky , 2004). In the s tudy , resear chers c ompar edtelomer elengths in
the whit e blood c ells in mothers o f chr onical ly ill childr en to those o f mothers o f heal thy childr en (Epel et al .,
2004). Mothers o f chr onical ly ill childr en w ould be e xpect ed to experienc e mor e stress than w ould mothers o f
heal thy childr en. The long er a mother had spent caring f or her il l child, the shor ter her t elomer es (the c orrelation
betw een y ears o f car egiving and t elomer e length w asr= -.40). In addition, higher le vels o f per ceived s tress were
negatively correlated with t elomer e siz e (r= -.31). These r esear chers also f ound that the a verage telomer e
length o f the mos t stressed mothers , compar ed to the leas t stressed, w as similar t o what y ou w ould find in
people who w ere 9–17 y ears older than the y were on a verage.
Numer ous other s tudies sinc e ha ve continued t o find as sociations betw een s tress and er oded t elomer es
(Blackburn & Epel , 2012). Some s tudies ha ve even demons trated that s tress can begin t o erode t elomer es in
childhood and perhaps e ven bef ore childr en ar e born. F or example , childhood e xposur e to violenc e (e.g.,
maternal domes tic violenc e, bul lying victimization, and ph ysical mal treatment) w as found in one s tudy t o
accelerate telomer e erosion fr om ag es 5 t o 10 (Shale v et al ., 2013). Another s tudy r epor ted that y oung adul ts
whose mothers had e xperienc ed se vere stress during their pr egnancy had shor ter telomer es than did those
whose mothers had s tress-free and une ventful pr egnancies (Entring er et al ., 2011). F urther, the c orrosiv e eff ects
of childhood s tress on t elomer es can e xtend int o young adul thood. In an in vestigation o f over 4,000 U .K. women
ages 41–80, adv erse e xperienc es during childhood (e .g., ph ysical abuse , being sent a way from home , and par ent
divorce) w ere as sociat ed with shor tened t elomer e length (Sur tees et al ., 2010), and t elomer e siz e decr eased as
the amount o f experienc ed adv ersity incr eased ( Figure 14.16 ).

Efforts to dis sect the pr ecise c ellular and ph ysiological mechanisms linking shor t telomer es to stress and disease
are curr ently under way. For the time being , telomer es pr ovide us with y et another r eminder that s tress,

The c ardio vascular s ystem is c omp osed of the he art and blo od circula tion s ystem . For man y years, disorders

A major risk factor f or he art dise ase is hypertension , which is high blo od pres sure . Hyp ertension f orces a
person ’s he art to pump harder , thus put ting more ph ysical strain on the he art. If left uncheck ed, hypertension
can le ad to a he art attack , strok e, or he art failure; it c an also le ad to kidne y failure and blindnes s. Hyp ertension
is a serious c ardio vascular disorder , and it is sometimes c alled the silent killer b ecause it has no
symptoms —one who has high blo od pres sure ma y not ev en b e aware o f it (AHA , 2012b).
Man y risk factors c ontributing to c ardio vascular disorders ha ve been identifie d. These risk factors include
social determinants such as a ging , inc ome , educ ation , and emplo yment s tatus, as w ell as b ehavioral risk
factors tha t include unhe alth y diet , tob acco use , physical inactivity , and e xcessive alc ohol c onsumption;
obesity and dia betes are additional risk factors ( World He alth Org aniza tion [WHO], 2013).
Over the p ast few dec ades , there has b een much gre ater rec ognition and a warenes s of the imp ortanc e of stres s
and other ps ychologic al factors in c ardio vascular he alth (Nusair , Al-dadah , & K umar , 2012). Indee d, exposure
to stres sors o f man y kinds has also b een link ed to c ardio vascular problems; in the c ase o f hypertension , some
of these s tres sors include job s train ( Trudel , Bris son, & Milot , 2010), na tural disas ters (Saito , Kim , Maeka wa,
Ikeda, & Y okoyama, 1997), marital c onflict (N ealey-Mo ore, Smith , Uchino , Ha wkins , & Olson-C erny, 2007), and
exposure to high tra ffic noise lev els a t one ’s home (de Kluiz enaar , Gansev oort, Mie dema, & de J ong , 2007).
Perceived discrimina tion app ears to b e as sociated with h ypertension among Afric an Americ ans (Sims et al .,
2012). In addition , laboratory-based stres s tasks , such as p erforming mental arithmetic under time pres sure ,
immersing one ’s hand into ic e water ( kno wn as the c old pres sor tes t), mirror tracing , and public sp eaking ha ve
all b een sho wn to elev ate blo od pres sure (Phillips , 2011).
Are You T ype A or T ype B?
Sometimes rese arch ide as and theories emerg e from seemingly trivial obser vations . In the 1950s , cardiologis t
Meyer F riedman w as lo oking o ver his w aiting ro om furniture , which c onsis ted of uphols tere d chairs with14.3 • S tress and Il lnes s507
armres ts. Friedman decide d to ha ve these chairs reuphols tere d. When the man doing the reuphols tering c ame
to the o ffice to do the w ork, he c ommente d on ho w the chairs w ere w orn in a unique manner —the front e dges
of the cushions w ere w orn do wn, as w ere the front tips o f the arm res ts. It seeme d lik e the c ardiolog y patients
were tapping or squee zing the front o f the armres ts, as w ell as literally sit ting on the e dge of their se ats
(Friedman & R osenman , 1974). W ere c ardiolog y patients someho w diff erent than other typ es o f patients? If so ,
how?
After rese arching this ma tter, Friedman and his c olleague, Ray Rosenman , came to unders tand tha t people
who are prone to he art dise ase tend to think , feel, and act diff erently than those who are not . These individuals
tend to b e intensiv ely driv en w orkaholics who are preo ccupie d with de adlines and alw ays seem to b e in a r ush .
According to F riedman and R osenman , these individuals e xhibit Type Abehavior p attern; those who are more
relax ed and laid-b ack w ere characteriz ed as Type B(Figure 14.18 ). In a sample o f Type As and T ype Bs ,
Friedman and R osenman w ere s tartled to disc over tha t he art dise ase w as o ver sev en times more fre quent
among the T ype As than the T ype Bs (F riedman & R osenman , 1959).
FIGURE 14.18 (a) T ype A individuals ar e char acterized as int ensel y driv en, (b) while T ype B people ar e

The major c omp onents o f the T ype A p attern include an a ggres sive and chronic s truggle to achiev e more and
more in les s and les s time (F riedman & R osenman , 1974). S pecific characteris tics o f the T ype A p attern
include an e xcessive comp etitiv e driv e, chronic sense o f time urg ency , imp atienc e, and hos tility to ward others
(particularly those who g et in the p erson ’s way).
An e xample o f a p erson who e xhibits T ype A b ehavior p attern is J effre y. Even as a child , Jeffre y was intense
and driv en. He e xcelled at scho ol, was c aptain o f the s wim te am, and gradua ted with honors from an Iv y
League c olleg e. Jeffre y nev er seems a ble to relax; he is alw ays working on something , even on the w eekends .
However, Jeffre y alw ays seems to f eel as though there are not enough hours in the da y to ac complish all he
feels he should . He v olunteers to tak e on e xtra tasks a t work and o ften brings his w ork home with him; he o ften
goes to b ed frustrated late at night b ecause he f eels tha t he has not done enough . Jeffre y is quick temp ered
with his c oworkers; he o ften b ecomes notic eably a gita ted when de aling with those c oworkers he f eels w ork to o
slowly or whose w ork do es not meet his s tandards . He typic ally re acts with hos tility when interr upte d at work.
He has e xperienc ed problems in his marria ge over his lack o f time sp ent with family . When c aught in tra ffic
during his c ommute to and from w ork, Jeffre y inc essantly p ounds on his horn and s wears loudly a t other
driv ers. When J effre y was 52, he suff ered his firs t he art attack .
By the 1970s , a majority o f practicing c ardiologis ts believ ed tha t Type A b ehavior p attern w as a signific ant risk
factor f or he art dise ase (F riedman , 1977). Indee d, a numb er o f early longitudinal in vestigations demons trated
a link b etween T ype A b ehavior p attern and la ter dev elopment o f he art dise ase (R osenman et al ., 1975;
Haynes , Feinleib , & K annel , 1980).
Subse quent rese arch e xamining the as sociation b etween T ype A and he art dise ase, however, faile d to replic ate
these e arlier findings (Glas sman , 2007; Myr tek, 2001). Bec ause T ype A theor y did not p an out as w ell as the y

predict he art dise ase.
Extensiv e rese arch cle arly sugg ests tha t the ang er/hos tility dimension o f Type A b ehavior p attern ma y be one
of the mos t imp ortant factors in the dev elopment o f he art dise ase. This rela tionship w as initially describ ed in
the Ha ynes et al . (1980) s tudy mentione d above: Suppres sed hos tility w as found to subs tantially elev ate the
risk o f he art dise ase f or b oth men and w omen . Also, one in vestigation f ollowed over 1,000 male me dical
students from 32 to 48 y ears. At the b eginning o f the s tudy , these men c omplete d a ques tionnaire as sessing
how the y re act to pres sure; some indic ated tha t the y resp ond with high lev els o fanger, where as others

After reviewing and s tatistically summarizing 35 s tudies from 1983 to 2006, Chida and Stepto e (2009)
conclude d tha t the bulk o f the evidenc e sugg ests tha t ang er and hos tility c onstitute serious long-term risk
factors f or adv erse c ardio vascular outc omes among b oth he alth y individuals and those alre ady suff ering from

could then la y the f ounda tion f or dise ase-promoting c ardio vascular resp onses among hos tile individuals

Socially , she is c onfronta tional and tends to use a harsh tone with p eople , which o ften le ads to v ery

In addition to ang er and hos tility , a numb er o f other neg ative emotional s tates ha ve been link ed with he art
dise ase, including neg ative affectivity and depres sion (Suls & B unde , 2005). Negative aff ectivityis a tendency

& Singh-Manoux , 2008). Henc e, neg ative affectivity app ears to b e a p otentially vital risk factor f or the
development o f cardio vascular disorders .
Depr ession and the Heart
For c enturies , poets and f olklore ha ve as serted tha t there is a c onnection b etween mo ods and the he art
(Glas sman & Shapiro , 1998). Y ou are no doubt familiar with the notion o f a brok en he art following a
disapp ointing or depres sing ev ent and ha ve enc ountere d tha t notion in songs , films , and litera ture .
Perhaps the firs t to rec ogniz e the link b etween depres sion and heart dise ase was Benjamin Malzb erg (1937),
who f ound tha t the de ath ra te among ins titutionaliz ed patients with melancholia (an archaic term f or
depres sion) w as six times higher than tha t of the p opula tion . A clas sic s tudy in the la te 1970s lo oked at over
8,000 p eople dia gnose d with manic -depres sive disorder (no w clas sifie d as bip olar disorder) in Denmark ,
finding a ne arly 50% incre ase in de aths from he art dise ase among these p atients c omp ared with the g eneral
Danish p opula tion ( Weeke, 1979). B y the e arly 1990s , evidenc e began to ac cumula te sho wing tha t depres sed
individuals who w ere f ollowed for long p erio ds o f time w ere a t incre ased risk f or he art dise ase and c ardiac

(Baref oot & Schroll , 1996). Figure 14.20 illus trates the grada tion in risk o f he art attacks f or b oth men and

After more than tw o dec ades o f rese arch , it is no w cle ar tha t a rela tionship e xists: P atients with he art dise ase
have more depres sion than the g eneral p opula tion , and p eople with depres sion are more lik ely to ev entually
develop he art dise ase and e xperienc e higher mor tality than those who do not ha ve depres sion (Hare ,
Toukhsa ti, Johans son, & J aarsma, 2013); the more sev ere the depres sion , the higher the risk (Glas sman , 2007).
Consider the f ollowing:
•In one s tudy , death ra tes from c ardio vascular problems w as subs tantially higher in depres sed people;

Asthma
Asthma is a chronic and serious dise ase in which the air ways of the respira tory system b ecome obs tructe d,
leading to gre at difficulty e xpelling air from the lungs . The air way obs truction is c aused by inflamma tion o f the
airways (leading to thick ening o f the air way walls) and a tightening o f the muscles around them , resulting in a
narro wing o f the air ways (Figure 14.21 ) (Americ an L ung As sociation , 2010). Bec ause air ways become
obstructe d, a p erson with as thma will sometimes ha ve gre at difficulty bre athing and will e xperienc e rep eated
episo des o f whee zing , ches t tightnes s, shor tnes s of bre ath, and c oughing , the la tter o ccurring mos tly during
the morning and night (CD C, 2006).
FIGURE 14.21 In as thma , the air ways bec ome inflamed and narr owed.
According to the C enters f or Dise ase C ontrol and P revention (CD C), around 4,000 p eople die e ach y ear from
asthma-rela ted causes , and as thma is a c ontributing factor to another 7,000 de aths e ach y ear (CD C, 2013a).
The CD C has rev ealed tha t asthma a ffects 18.7 million U .S. adults and is more c ommon among p eople with
lower inc ome lev els (CD C, 2013b). Esp ecially c oncerning is tha t asthma is on the rise , with ra tes o f asthma
incre asing 157% b etween 2000 and 2010 (CD C, 2013b).
Asthma a ttacks are acute episo des in which an as thma suff erer e xperienc es the full rang e of symptoms .
Asthma e xacerbation is o ften trigg ered by en vironmental factors , such as air p ollution , allerg ens (e .g., pollen ,
mold , and p et hairs), cig aret te smok e, air way inf ections , cold air or a sudden chang e in temp erature , and
exercise (CD C, 2013b). C ertain regions and neighb orho ods are kno wn f or ha ving nota bly high ra tes o f asthma
and rela ted dise ases due to high ra tes o f concentra ted pollution and lo w air quality . For e xample , Long Be ach,
California and Bronx , New Y ork c ontain "as thma alle ys" due to the density o f trucking , power plants , factories ,
sew age works , or other a gents o f air p ollution .
Psychologic al factors app ear to pla y an imp ortant role in as thma ( Wright , Rodrigue z, & C ohen , 1998), although
some b eliev e tha t psychologic al factors ser ve as p otential trigg ers in only a subset o f asthma p atients (Ritz,
Stepto e, Bobb , Harris , & E dwards , 2006). Man y studies o ver the y ears ha ve demons trated tha t some p eople512 14 • S tress, Lifestyle, and Heal th

breathing an iner t subs tanc e tha t the y (falsely ) believ e will le ad to air way obs truction (So dergren & Hyland ,
1999). As s tres s and emotions directly a ffect immune and respira tory functions , psychologic al factors lik ely
serve as one o f the mos t common trigg ers o f asthma e xacerbation ( Trueb a & Ritz, 2013).
People with as thma tend to rep ort and displa y a high lev el of neg ative emotions such as anxiety , and as thma
attacks ha ve been link ed to p erio ds o f high emotionality (Lehrer , Isenb erg, & Ho chron , 1993). In addition , high

negative emotions and s tres s were as sociated with incre ased air way obs truction and self -rep orted as thma
symptoms (Sm yth, Soefer, Hurewitz, Kliment , & Stone , 1999). In addition , D’Ama to, Lic cardi , Cecchi,
Pellegrino , & D ’Ama to (2010) describ ed a c ase s tudy o f an 18- year-old man with as thma whose girlfriend had
brok en up with him , leaving him in a depres sed state. She had also unfriende d him on F acebook, while
friending other y oung males . Eventually , the y oung man w as a ble to “friend ” her onc e again and c ould monitor
her activity through F acebook. Subse quently , he w ould e xperienc e as thma s ymptoms whenev er he logg ed on
and ac cessed her pro file. When he la ter resigne d not to use F acebook an y long er, the as thma a ttacks s topp ed.
This c ase sugg ests tha t the use o f Facebook and other f orms o f social me dia ma y represent a new sourc e of
stres s—it ma y be a trigg ering factor f or as thma a ttacks , esp ecially in depres sed as thma tic individuals .
Exp osure to s tres sful e xperienc es, particularly those tha t involve parental or interp ersonal c onflicts , has b een
link ed to the dev elopment o f asthma throughout the lif espan. A longitudinal s tudy o f 145 children f ound tha t
parenting difficulties during the firs t year o f life incre ased the chanc es tha t the child dev elop ed as thma b y
107% (Klinner t et al ., 2001). In addition , a cros s-sectional s tudy o f over 10,000 F innish c olleg e students f ound
that high ra tes o f parent or p ersonal c onflicts (e .g., parental div orce, sep aration from sp ouse , or sev ere
conflicts in other long-term rela tionships) incre ased the risk o f asthma onset (Kilp eläinen , Koskenvuo,
Helenius , & T erho , 2002). F urther , a s tudy o f over 4,000 middle -aged men who w ere inter view ed in the e arly
1990s and a gain a dec ade la ter f ound tha t bre aking o ff an imp ortant lif e partnership (e .g., div orce or bre aking

(Loerbroks , Apfelbacher , Tha yer, Debling , & Stürmer , 2009).
Headaches
A he adache is a c ontinuous p ain an ywhere in the he ad and neck region . Inflamma tion o f the sinuses c aused by
an inf ection or allergic re action c an c ause sinus he adaches , which are e xperienc ed as p ain in the cheeks and

head, an upset s tomach , and dis turb ed vision . The y are more fre quently e xperienc ed by women than b y men
(Americ an A cadem y of Neurolog y, 2014). T ension he adaches are trigg ered by tightening /tensing o f facial and
neck muscles; the y are the mos t commonly e xperienc ed kind o f he adache , accounting f or a bout 42% o f all
headaches w orldwide (Sto vner et al ., 2007). In the Unite d Sta tes, well o ver one -third o f the p opula tion

A numb er o f factors c an c ontribute to tension he adaches , including sleep depriv ation , skipping me als, eye

LEARNING OBJEC TIVES
By the end o f this section, y ou wil l be able t o:
•Define c oping and diff erentiat e betw een pr oblem-f ocused and emotion-f ocused c oping
•Describe the impor tanc e of per ceived c ontr ol in our r eactions t o stress
•Explain ho w social suppor t is vital in heal th and long evity
As w e learne d in the previous section ,stres s—especially if it is chronic —tak es a toll on our b odies and c an ha ve
enormously neg ative he alth implic ations . When w e experienc e ev ents in our liv es tha t we appraise as s tres sful,
it is es sential tha t we use eff ectiv e coping s trategies to mana ge our s tres s.Coping refers to mental and
behavioral eff orts tha t we use to de al with problems rela ting to s tres s.
Coping Styles
Lazar us and F olkman (1984) dis tinguishe d tw o fundamental kinds o f coping: problem-f ocuse d coping and
emotion-f ocuse d coping . In problem-f ocuse d coping , one a ttempts to mana ge or alter the problem tha t is
causing one to e xperienc e stres s (i.e., the s tres sor). P roblem-f ocuse d coping s trategies are similar to s trategies
used in ev eryday problem-solving: the y typic ally in volve identif ying the problem , considering p ossible
solutions , weighing the c osts and b enefits o f these solutions , and then selecting an alterna tive (Lazar us &
Folkman , 1984). As an e xample , supp ose Bradf ord rec eives a midterm notic e tha t he is failing s tatistics clas s. If
Bradf ord adopts a problem-f ocuse d coping appro ach to mana ging his s tres s, he w ould b e pro activ e in tr ying to
allevia te the sourc e of the s tres s. He might c ontact his pro fessor to discus s wha t mus t be done to raise his
grade , he might also decide to set aside tw o hours daily to s tudy s tatistics as signments , and he ma y seek
tutoring as sistanc e. A problem-f ocuse d appro ach to mana ging s tres s me ans w e activ ely tr y to do things to
addres s the problem .
Emotion-f ocuse d coping , in c ontras t, consis ts of eff orts to chang e or re duce the neg ative emotions as sociated
with s tres s. These eff orts ma y include a voiding , minimizing , or dis tancing oneself from the problem , or
positiv e comp arisons with others (“I’ m not as b ad o ff as she is”), or seeking something p ositiv e in a neg ative
event (“N ow tha t I’ve been fire d, I can sleep in f or a f ew da ys”). In some c ases ,emotion-f ocuse d coping
strategies in volve re appraisal , whereb y the s tres sor is c onstrued diff erently (and somewha t self -dec eptiv ely)
without changing its objectiv e lev el of thre at (Lazar us & F olkman , 1984). F or e xample , a p erson sentenc ed to
federal prison who thinks , “This will giv e me a gre at chanc e to netw ork with others ,” is using re appraisal . If
Bradf ord adopte d an emotion-f ocuse d appro ach to mana ging his midterm deficiency s tres s, he might w atch a
come dy mo vie, pla y video g ames , or sp end hours on so cial me dia to tak e his mind o ff the situa tion . In a c ertain
sense , emotion-f ocuse d coping c an b e thought o f as tre ating the s ymptoms ra ther than the actual c ause.
While man y stres sors elicit b oth kinds o f coping s trategies , problem-f ocuse d coping is more lik ely to o ccur
when enc ountering s tres sors w e perceive as c ontrolla ble, while emotion-f ocuse d coping is more lik ely to
predomina te when fac ed with s tres sors tha t we believ e we are p owerles s to chang e (Folkman & Lazar us, 1980).
Clearly , emotion-f ocuse d coping is more eff ectiv e in de aling with unc ontrolla ble s tres sors . For e xample , the
stres s you e xperienc e when a lo ved one dies c an b e overwhelming . You are simply p owerles s to chang e the
situa tion as there is nothing y ou c an do to bring this p erson b ack. The mos t helpful c oping resp onse is
emotion-f ocuse d coping aime d at minimizing the p ain o f the grieving p erio d.
Fortuna tely, mos t stres sors w e enc ounter c an b e mo difie d and are , to v arying degrees , controlla ble. A p erson
who c annot s tand her job c an quit and lo ok for w ork elsewhere; a middle -aged div orcee c an find another
potential p artner; the freshman who fails an e xam c an s tudy harder ne xt time , and a bre ast lump do es not

Contr ol and Str ess
The desire and a bility to pre dict ev ents , mak e decisions , and a ffect outc omes —tha t is, to enact c ontrol in our
lives—is a b asic tenet o f human b ehavior (E verly & La ting , 2002). A lbert Bandura (1997) s tated tha t “the
intensity and chronicity o f human s tres s is g overne d larg ely b y perceived control o ver the demands o f one ’s
life” (p. 262). As c ogently describ ed in his s tatement , our re action to p otential s tres sors dep ends to a larg e
extent on ho w much c ontrol w e feel w e ha ve over such things .Perceived control is our b eliefs a bout our
personal c apacity to e xert influenc e over and shap e outc omes , and it has major implic ations f or our he alth and
happines s (Infurna & Gers torf, 2014). Extensiv e rese arch has demons trated tha t perceptions o f personal
control are as sociated with a v ariety o f favorable outc omes , such as b etter ph ysical and mental he alth and
greater ps ychologic al w ell-b eing (Diehl & Ha y, 2010). Gre ater p ersonal c ontrol is also as sociated with lo wer
reactivity to s tres sors in daily lif e. For e xample , rese archers in one in vestigation f ound tha t higher lev els o f
perceived control a t one p oint in time w ere la ter as sociated with lo wer emotional and ph ysical re activity to
interp ersonal s tres sors (N eup ert, Almeida, & Charles , 2007). F urther , a daily diar y study with 34 older wido ws
found tha t their s tres s and anxiety lev els w ere signific antly re duced on da ys during which the wido ws felt
greater p erceived control (Ong , Berg eman , & Bisc onti , 2005).
Learned Helplessness
When w e lack a sense o f contr ol over the e vents in our liv es, par ticularl y when those e vents ar e thr eatening ,
harmful , or no xious , the ps ychological c onsequenc es can be pr ofound. In one o f the bet ter illustrations o f this
concept, ps ychologis t Mar tin Seligman c onduct ed a series o f clas sic e xperiments in the 1960s (Seligman &
Maier , 1967) in which dogs w ere plac ed in a chamber wher e the y received electric shock s from which the y could
not escape . Later, when these dogs w ere giv en the oppor tunity t o escape the shock s by jumping acr oss a
partition, mos t failed t o even tr y; the y seemed t o jus t giv e up and pas sively accept any shock s the e xperiment ers
chose t o adminis ter. In c omparison, dogs who w ere previousl y allowed to escape the shock s tended t o jump the
partition and escape the pain ( Figure 14.22 ).
FIGURE 14.22 Seligman ’s learned helples snes s experiments with dogs used an appar atus that measur ed when

Seligman belie ved that the dogs who failed t o try to escape the lat er shock s were demons trating learnedDIG DEEPER14.4 • R egulation o f Stress515
helples snes s: The y had ac quired a belief that the y were po werles s to do an ything about the s timulation the y
were receiving . Seligman also belie ved that the pas sivity and lack o f initiativ e these dogs demons trated w as
similar t o that obser ved in human depr ession. Ther efore, Seligman speculat ed that learned helples snes s might
be an impor tant cause o f depr ession in humans: Humans who e xperienc e neg ative life events that the y belie ve
they are unable t o contr ol ma y bec ome helples s. As a r esul t, the y giv e up tr ying t o chang e the situation and some
may bec ome depr essed and sho w lack o f initiativ e in futur e situations in which the y can c ontr ol the out comes
(Seligman, Maier , & Geer , 1968). In an application Seligman ne ver pr oposed, learned helples snes s was lat er used
as a methodolog y in the t orture of prisoners b y U.S. militar y and int elligence personnel f ollowing the 2001
attack s on the W orld T rade Cent er. The ps ychologis ts who designed the t orture program, James E. Mit chel l and
Bruc e Jes son, theoriz ed that detainees who w ere subject ed to unc ontr ollable afflictions w ould e ventual ly
become pas sive and c ompliant, making them mor e lik ely to reveal inf ormation t o their int errogators. Ther e is
little e videnc e that the pr ogram achie ved w orthwhile r esul ts. It is no w widel y regarded as unethical and
unjus tified. This e xample emphasiz es the need t o consis tently consider the ethics o f resear ch s tudies and their
applications (K onnik ova, 2015).
Seligman and c olleag ues lat er reformulat ed the original learned helples snes s model o f depr ession (Abr amson,
Seligman, & T easdale , 1978). In their r eformulation, the y emphasiz ed at tributions (i. e., a mental e xplanation f or
why something oc curr ed) that f ostered a sense o f learned helples snes s. For example , suppose a c oworker sho ws
up lat e to work; y our belief as t o what caused the c oworker’s tar dines s would be an at tribution (e .g., too much
traffic, slep t too lat e, or jus t doesn ’t car e about being on time).
The r eformulat ed v ersion o f Seligman ’s study holds that the at tributions made f or neg ative life events c ontribut e
to depr ession. Consider the e xample o f a s tudent who per forms poorl y on a midt erm e xam. This model sug gests
that the s tudent wil l mak e thr ee kinds o f attributions f or this out come: int ernal vs . external (belie ving the
outcome w as caused b y his o wn personal inadequacies or b y en vironmental fact ors), s table vs . uns table
(belie ving the cause can be chang ed or is permanent), and global vs . specific (belie ving the out come is a sign o f
inadequacy in mos t everything v ersus jus t this ar ea). As sume that the s tudent mak es an int ernal (“I’ m jus t not
smar t”), s table (“Nothing can be done t o chang e the fact that I’ m not smar t”) and global (“ This is another
example o f how lous y I am at e verything ”) at tribution f or the poor per formanc e. The r eformulat ed theor y
predicts that the s tudent w ould per ceive a lack o f contr ol over this s tressful e vent and thus be especial ly prone
to de veloping depr ession. Indeed, r esear ch has demons trated that people who ha ve a t endency t o mak e
internal , global , and s table at tributions f or bad out comes t end t o de velop s ymp toms o f depr ession when fac ed
with neg ative life experienc es (P eterson & Seligman, 1984). F ortunat ely, attribution habits can be chang ed
through pr actic e. Training in heal thy attribution habits has been sho wn t o mak e people les s vulner able t o
depr ession (K onnik ova, 2015).
Seligman ’s learned helples snes s model has emer ged o ver the y ears as a leading theor etical e xplanation f or the
onset o f major depr essive disor der. When y ou s tudy ps ychological disor ders , you wil l learn mor e about the lat est
reformulation o f this model —no w cal led hopeles snes s theor y.
People who rep ort higher lev els o f perceived control view their he alth as c ontrolla ble, thereb y making it more
likely tha t the y will b etter mana ge their he alth and eng age in b ehaviors c onduciv e to g ood he alth (Bandura,
2004). N ot surprisingly , gre ater p erceived control has b een link ed to lo wer risk o f ph ysical he alth problems ,
including declines in ph ysical functioning (Infurna, Gers torf, Ram , Schupp , & W agner , 2011), he art attacks
(Rosengren et al ., 2004), and b oth c ardio vascular dise ase incidenc e (Stürmer , Has selb ach, & Amelang , 2006)
and mor tality from c ardiac dise ase (Sur tees et al ., 2010). In addition , longitudinal s tudies o f British civil
servants ha ve found tha t those in lo w-status jobs (e .g., cleric al and o ffice supp ort staff) in which the degree o f
control o ver the job is minimal are c onsidera bly more lik ely to dev elop he art dise ase than those with high-

The link b etween p erceived control and he alth ma y pro vide an e xplana tion f or the fre quently obser ved
rela tionship b etween so cial clas s and he alth outc omes (K raus, Piff, Mendo za-Denton , Rheinschmidt , & K eltner ,
2012). In g eneral , rese arch has f ound tha t more a ffluent individuals e xperienc e better he alth p artly b ecause
they tend to b eliev e tha t the y can p ersonally c ontrol and mana ge their re actions to lif e’s stres sors (J ohnson &
Krueger, 2006). P erhaps buo yed by the p erceived lev el of control , individuals o f higher so cial clas s ma y be
prone to o veres tima ting the degree o f influenc e the y ha ve over p articular outc omes . For e xample , those o f
higher so cial clas s tend to b eliev e tha t their v otes ha ve gre ater s way on election outc omes than do those o f
lower so cial clas s, which ma y explain higher ra tes o f voting in more a ffluent c ommunities (K rosnick , 1990).
Other rese arch has f ound tha t a sense o f perceived control c an protect les s affluent individuals from p oorer
health , depres sion , and re duced lif e-satisfaction—all o f which tend to ac comp any lower so cial s tanding
(Lachman & W eaver, 1998).
Taken tog ether , findings from these and man y other s tudies cle arly sugg est tha t perceptions o f control and
coping a bilities are imp ortant in mana ging and c oping with the s tres sors w e enc ounter throughout lif e.
Social Support
The nee d to f orm and maintain s trong , stable rela tionships with others is a p owerful, pervasiv e, and
fundamental human motiv e (Ba umeis ter & Le ary, 1995). B uilding s trong interp ersonal rela tionships with
others helps us es tablish a netw ork o f close , caring individuals who c an pro vide so cial supp ort in times o f
distres s, sorro w, and f ear.Social supp ortcan b e thought o f as the so othing imp act o f friends , family , and
acquaintanc es (Baron & K err, 2003). So cial supp ort can tak e man y forms , including advic e, guidanc e,
encoura gement , acceptanc e, emotional c omf ort, and tangible as sistanc e (such as financial help). Thus , other
people c an b e very comf orting to us when w e are fac ed with a wide rang e of life stres sors , and the y can b e
extremely helpful in our eff orts to mana ge these challeng es. Even in nonhuman animals , species ma tes c an
offer so cial supp ort during times o f stres s. For e xample , elephants seem to b e able to sense when other
elephants are s tres sed and will o ften c omf ort them with ph ysical contact —such as a tr unk touch— or an
emp athetic v ocal resp onse (K rumb oltz, 2014).
Scientific interes t in the imp ortanc e of social supp ort firs t emerg ed in the 1970s when he alth rese archers

A numb er o f larg e-scale s tudies ha ve found tha t individuals with lo w lev els o f social supp ort are a t gre ater risk

For man y of us, friends are a vital sourc e of social supp ort. But wha t if y ou find y ourself in a situa tion in which
you ha ve few friends and c omp anions? Man y students who le ave home to a ttend and liv e at colleg e experienc e
dras tic re ductions in their so cial supp ort, which mak es them vulnera ble to anxiety , depres sion , and lonelines s.
Social me dia c an sometimes b e useful in na vigating these transitions (Rane y & T roop Gordon , 2012) but might
also c ause incre ases in lonelines s (Hunt , Marx , Lipson , & Y oung , 2018). F or this re ason , man y colleg es ha ve
designe d firs t-year programs , such as p eer mentoring (Ra ymond & Shep ard, 2018), tha t can help s tudents
build new so cial netw orks . For some p eople , our families —especially our p arents —are a major sourc e of social
supp ort.
Social supp ort app ears to w ork b y boosting the immune s ystem , esp ecially among p eople who are
experiencing s tres s (U chino , Vaughn , Carlisle , & Birmingham , 2012). In a pioneering s tudy , spouses o f cancer
patients who rep orted high lev els o f social supp ort sho wed indic ations o f better immune functioning on tw o
out o f three immune functioning me asures , comp ared to sp ouses who w ere b elow the me dian on rep orted

similar results , including those o f spousal c aregiv ers o f dementia suff erers , me dical students , elderly adults ,
and c ancer p atients (C ohen & Herb ert, 1996; Kiec olt-Glaser , McGuire , Robles , & Glaser , 2002).
In addition , social supp ort has b een sho wn to re duce blo od pres sure f or p eople p erforming s tres sful tasks ,
such as giving a sp eech or p erforming mental arithmetic (Lep ore, 1998). In these kinds o f studies , particip ants
are usually ask ed to p erform a s tres sful task either alone , with a s trang er present ( who ma y be either
supp ortive or unsupp ortive), or with a friend present . Those tes ted with a friend present g enerally e xhibit
lower blo od pres sure than those tes ted alone or with a s trang er (F ontana, Diegnan , Villeneuv e, & Lep ore,
1999). In one s tudy , 112 f emale p articip ants who p erforme d stres sful mental arithmetic e xhibite d lower blo od
pres sure when the y rec eived supp ort from a friend ra ther than a s trang er, but only if the friend w as a male

mention tha t it is p ossible tha t females f eel les s supp orted and more ev alua ted by other f emales , particularly
females whose opinions the y value .

Stress and Discrimination
Being the r ecipient o f prejudic e and discrimination is as sociat ed with a number o f neg ative out comes . Man y
studies ha ve sho wn ho w discrimination is a significant s tressor f or mar ginaliz ed gr oups (P ascoe & Smar t
Richman, 2009). Discrimination neg atively impacts both ph ysical and mental heal th for individuals in s tigmatiz ed
groups . As y ou’ll learn when y ou s tudy social ps ycholog y, various social identities (such as g ender , age, religion,
sexuality , ethnicity) o ften lead people t o simul taneousl y be e xposed t o mul tiple f orms o f discrimination, which
can ha ve even s tronger neg ative eff ects on mental and ph ysical heal th (Vines , Ward, Cor doba , & Black, 2017).
For example , the amplified le vels o f discrimination fac ed b y Latinx tr ansgender w omen ma y ha ve related eff ects ,
leading t o high s tress levels and poor mental and ph ysical heal th out comes .
Perceived c ontr ol and the g ener al adap tation s yndr ome help e xplain the pr ocess by which discrimination aff ects
mental and ph ysical heal th. Discrimination can be c onceptualiz ed as an unc ontr ollable , persis tent, and
unpr edictable s tressor. When a discriminat ory event oc curs , the tar get of the e vent initial ly experienc es an acut e
stress response (alarm s tage). This acut e reaction alone does not typical ly ha ve a gr eat impact on heal th.
However, discrimination t ends t o be a chr onic s tressor. As people in mar ginaliz ed gr oups e xperienc e repeat ed
discrimination, the y de velop a height ened r eactivity as their bodies pr epar e to act quickl y (resistanc e stage). This
long-t erm ac cumulation o f stress responses can e ventual ly lead t o incr eases in neg ative emotion and w ear on
physical heal th (e xhaus tion s tage). This e xplains wh y a his tory of per ceived discrimination is as sociat ed with a
host of mental and ph ysical heal th pr oblems including depr ession, car diovascular disease , and canc er (P ascoe &
Smar t Richman, 2009).
Protecting s tigmatiz ed gr oups fr om the neg ative impact o f discrimination-induc ed s tress ma y involve reducing
the incidenc e of discriminat ory beha viors in c onjunction with pr otectiv e strategies that r educ e the impact o f
discriminat ory events when the y oc cur. Civil rights legislation has pr otected some s tigmatiz ed gr oups b y making
discrimination a pr osecutable o ffense in man y social c ontexts. Ho wever, some gr oups (e .g., transgender people)
often lack impor tant leg al recourse when discrimination oc curs . Mor eover, mos t modern discrimination c omes in
subtle forms that fal l belo w the r adar o f the la w. For example , discrimination ma y be e xperienc ed as selectiv e
inhospitality t oward people o f specific r aces or ethnicities , but lit tle is done in r esponse sinc e it w ould be eas y to
attribut e the beha vior t o other causes . Although some cul tural chang es ar e incr easingl y helping people t o
recogniz e and c ontr ol sub tle discrimination, such shifts ma y tak e a long time .
Similar t o other s tressors , buff ers lik e social suppor t and heal thy coping s trategies appear t o be eff ectiv e in
lowering the impact o f per ceived discrimination. F or example , one s tudy (Ajr ouch, R eisine , Lim, Sohn, & Ismail ,
2010) sho wed that discrimination pr edict ed high ps ychological dis tress among African American mothers living
in Detr oit. Ho wever, the w omen who had r eadil y available emotional suppor t from friends and famil y experienc ed
less dis tress than those with f ewer social r esour ces. While c oping s trategies and social suppor t ma y buff er the
effects o f discrimination, the y fail t o erase al l of the neg ative impacts . Vigilant antidiscrimination eff orts,
including the de velopment o f leg al pr otections f or vulner able gr oups , are needed t o reduc e discrimination,
stress, and the r esul ting ph ysical and mental heal th eff ects .
Stress R eduction T echniques
Beyond ha ving a sense o f control and es tablishing so cial supp ort netw orks , there are numerous other me ans
by which w e can mana ge stres s (Figure 14.24 ). A c ommon technique p eople use to c omb at stres s is exercise
(Salmon , 2001). It is w ell-es tablishe d tha t exercise , both o f long (aerobic) and shor t (anaerobic) dura tion , is
beneficial f or b oth ph ysical and mental he alth (E verly & La ting , 2002). There is c onsidera ble evidenc e tha t

stres s than les s ph ysically fit individuals (C otton, 1990). In a s tudy o f more than 500 Swis s police officers and
emerg ency ser vice personnel , incre ased ph ysical fitnes s was as sociated with re duced stres s, and regular
exercise w as rep orted to protect a gains t stres s-rela ted he alth problems (Gerb er, Kellman , Har tman , & Pühse ,
2010).

One re ason e xercise ma y be beneficial is b ecause it might buff er some o f the deleterious ph ysiologic al
mechanisms o f stres s. One s tudy f ound ra ts tha t exercise d for six w eeks sho wed a decre ase in h ypothalamic -
pituitar y-adrenal resp onsiv enes s to mild s tres sors (C amp eau et al ., 2010). In high-s tres s humans , exercise has
been sho wn to prev ent telomere shor tening , which ma y explain the c ommon obser vation o f a y outhful
app earanc e among those who e xercise regularly (Puterman et al ., 2010). F urther , exercise in la ter adultho od
app ears to minimiz e the detrimental eff ects o f stres s on the hipp ocampus and memor y (He ad, Singh , & B ugg,
2012). Among c ancer sur vivors, exercise has b een sho wn to re duce anxiety (S peck, Courne ya, Mas se, Duv al, &
Schmitz, 2010) and depres sive symptoms (C raft, VanIterson , Heleno wski, Rademak er, & C ourne ya, 2012).
Clearly , exercise is a highly eff ectiv e tool for regula ting s tres s.
In the 1970s , Herb ert Benson , a c ardiologis t, dev elop ed a s tres s reduction metho d called the relaxat ion
resp onse technique (Greenb erg, 2006). The relaxa tion resp onse technique c ombines relaxa tion with
transc endental medita tion , and c onsis ts of four c omp onents (Stein , 2001):
1. sitting upright on a c omf ortable chair with f eet on the ground and b ody in a relax ed position ,
2. being in a quiet en vironment with e yes close d,
3. repeating a w ord or a phrase —a mantra—to oneself, such as “ aler t mind , calm b ody,”
4. passively allo wing the mind to f ocus on ple asant thoughts , such as na ture or the w armth o f your blo od
nourishing y our b ody.
The relaxa tion resp onse appro ach is c onceptualiz ed as a g eneral appro ach to s tres s reduction tha t reduces
symp athetic arousal , and it has b een use d eff ectiv ely to tre at people with high blo od pres sure (Benson &
Proctor , 1994).
Another technique to c omb at stres s,biof eedback, was dev elop ed by Gary Sch wartz at Har vard Univ ersity in
the e arly 1970s . Bio feedback is a technique tha t uses electronic e quipment to ac cura tely me asure a p erson ’s
neuromuscular and a utonomic activity —feedback is pro vide d in the f orm o f visual or a uditor y signals . The
main as sumption o f this appro ach is tha t pro viding someb ody bio feedback will ena ble the individual to
develop s trategies tha t help g ain some lev el of voluntar y control o ver wha t are normally in voluntar y bodily
processes (Sch wartz & Sch wartz, 1995). A numb er o f diff erent b odily me asures ha ve been use d in bio feedback
rese arch , including facial muscle mo vement , brain activity , and skin temp erature , and it has b een applie d
successfully with individuals e xperiencing tension he adaches , high blo od pres sure , asthma, and phobias

Although the s tudy o fstres sand ho w it a ffects us ph ysically and ps ychologic ally is fascina ting , it
is—admit tedly—somewha t of a grim topic . Psycholog y is also interes ted in the s tudy o f a more upb eat and
encoura ging appro ach to human a ffairs —the ques t for happines s.
Happiness
Americ a’s founders declare d tha t its citiz ens ha ve an unaliena ble right to pursue happines s. But wha t is
happines s? When ask ed to define the term , people emphasiz e diff erent asp ects o f this elusiv e state. Indee d,
happines s is somewha t ambiguous and c an b e define d from diff erent p ersp ectiv es (Mar tin, 2012). Some
people , esp ecially those who are highly c ommit ted to their religious faith , view happines s in w ays tha t
emphasiz e vir tuosity , rev erenc e, and enlightene d spirituality . Others see happines s as primarily
contentment —the inner p eace and jo y tha t come from deep sa tisfaction with one ’s surroundings , rela tionships
with others , accomplishments , and oneself. Still others view happines s mainly as ple asura ble eng agement
with their p ersonal en vironment —ha ving a c areer and hobbies tha t are eng aging , me aningful , rew arding , and
exciting . These diff erenc es, of course , are merely diff erenc es in emphasis . Mos t people w ould prob ably a gree
that each o f these view s, in some resp ects , captures the es senc e of happines s.
Elements of Happiness
Some ps ychologis ts ha ve sugg ested tha t happines s consis ts of three dis tinct elements: the ple asant lif e, the
good lif e, and the me aningful lif e, as sho wn in Figure 14.25 (Seligman , 2002; Seligman , Steen , Park, &
Peterson , 2005). The ple asant lif e is re alized through the a ttainment o f day-to-day ple asures tha t add fun , joy,
and e xcitement to our liv es. For e xample , evening w alks along the b each and a fulfilling se x lif e can enhanc e
our daily ple asure and c ontribute to the ple asant lif e. The g ood lif e is achiev ed through identif ying our unique
skills and a bilities and eng aging these talents to enrich our liv es; those who achiev e the g ood lif e often find
themselv es a bsorb ed in their w ork or their recre ational pursuits . The me aningful lif e involves a deep sense o f
fulfillment tha t comes from using our talents in the ser vice of the gre ater g ood: in w ays tha t benefit the liv es o f
others or tha t mak e the w orld a b etter plac e. In g eneral , the happies t people tend to b e those who pursue the
full lif e—the y orient their pursuits to ward all three elements (Seligman et al ., 2005).14.5 • The Pursuit o f Happines s521
FIGURE 14.25 Happines s is an enduring s tate of well-being in volving satis faction in the pleasant, g ood, and
meaningful aspects o f life.
For practic al purp oses , a precise definition o fhappines smight inc orporate each o f these elements: an
enduring s tate of mind c onsis ting o f joy, contentment , and other p ositiv e emotions , plus the sense tha t one ’s
life has me aning and v alue (L yub omirsky , 2001). The definition implies tha t happines s is a long-term
state—wha t is o ften characteriz ed as subjectiv e well-b eing—ra ther than merely a transient p ositiv e mo od we all
experienc e from time to time . It is this enduring happines s tha t has c apture d the interes ts of psychologis ts and
other so cial scientis ts.
The s tudy o f happines s has gro wn drama tically in the las t three dec ades (Diener , 2013). One o f the mos t basic
ques tions tha t happines s investigators routinely e xamine is this: Ho w happ y are p eople in g eneral? The
average person in the w orld tends to b e rela tively happ y and tends to indic ate experiencing more p ositiv e
feelings than neg ative feelings (Diener , Ng, Har ter, & Arora, 2010). When ask ed to ev alua te their current liv es
on a sc ale ranging from 0 to 10 ( with 0 representing “ worst possible lif e” and 10 representing “b est possible
life”), p eople in more than 150 c ountries sur veyed from 2010–2012 rep orted an a verage sc ore o f 5.2. P eople
who liv e in N orth Americ a, Australia, and N ew Z ealand rep orted the highes t average sc ore a t 7.1, where as
those living Sub -Saharan Afric a rep orted the lo west average sc ore a t 4.6 (Helliw ell, Layard, & Sachs , 2013).
Worldwide , the fiv e happies t countries are Denmark , Norway, Switz erland , the N etherlands , and Sw eden; the
Unite d Sta tes is rank ed 17th happies t (Figure 14.26 ) (Helliw ell et al ., 2013).

Several y ears a go, a G allup sur vey of more than 1,000 U .S. adults f ound tha t 52% rep orted tha t the y were “ very522 14 • S tress, Lifestyle, and Heal th

happ y.” In addition , more than 8 in 10 indic ated tha t the y were “ very sa tisfied” with their liv es (C arroll , 2007).
However, a rec ent p oll found tha t only 42% o f Americ an adults rep ort being " very happ y." The groups tha t
show the gre atest declines in happines s are p eople o f color , those who ha ve not c omplete d a c olleg e educ ation ,
and those who p olitic ally identif y as Demo crats or indep endents (McC arthy, 2020). These results sugg est tha t
challenging ec onomic c onditions ma y be rela ted to declines in happines s. Of c ourse , this interpreta tion
implies tha t happines s is closely tie d to one 's financ es. But, is it? Wha t factors influenc e happines s?
Factors Connected to Happiness
Wha t really mak es p eople happ y? Wha t factors c ontribute to sus taine d joy and c ontentment? Is it mone y,
attractiv enes s, ma terial p ossessions , a rew arding o ccup ation , a sa tisfying rela tionship? Extensiv e rese arch
over the y ears has e xamine d this ques tion . One finding is tha t age is rela ted to happines s: Lif e sa tisfaction
usually incre ases the older p eople g et, but there do not app ear to b e gender diff erenc es in happines s (Diener ,
Suh , Lucas, & Smith , 1999). A lthough it is imp ortant to p oint out tha t much o f this w ork has b een c orrela tional ,
man y of the k ey findings (some o f which ma y surprise y ou) are summariz ed below.
Family and other so cial rela tionships app ear to b e key factors c orrela ted with happines s. Studies sho w tha t
marrie d people rep ort being happier than those who are single , div orced, or wido wed (Diener et al ., 1999).
Happ y individuals also rep ort tha t their marria ges are fulfilling (L yub omirsky , King , & Diener , 2005). In fact ,
some ha ve sugg ested tha t satisfaction with marria ge and family lif e is the s trong est pre dictor o f happines s
(Myers, 2000). Happ y people tend to ha ve more friends , more high-quality so cial rela tionships , and s trong er
social supp ort netw orks than les s happ y people (L yub omirsky et al ., 2005). Happ y people also ha ve a high
frequency o f contact with friends (Pinquar t & Sörensen , 2000).
Can mone y buy happines s? In g eneral , extensiv e rese arch sugg ests tha t the ans wer is y es, but with sev eral
caveats. While a na tion ’s per capita gros s domes tic pro duct (GDP) is as sociated with happines s lev els (Helliw ell
et al ., 2013), chang es in GDP ( which is a les s certain inde x of household inc ome) b ear lit tle rela tionship to
chang es in happines s (Diener , Tay, & Oishi , 2013). On the whole , residents o f affluent c ountries tend to b e
happier than residents o f poor c ountries; within c ountries , wealth y individuals are happier than p oor
individuals , but the as sociation is much w eaker (Diener & Bis was-Diener , 2002). T o the e xtent tha t it le ads to
incre ases in purchasing p ower, incre ases in inc ome are as sociated with incre ases in happines s (Diener , Oishi ,
& Ryan, 2013). Ho wever, inc ome within so cieties app ears to c orrela te with happines s only up to a p oint . In a
study o f over 450,000 U .S. residents sur veyed by the G allup Org aniza tion , Kahneman and De aton (2010) f ound
that well-b eing rises with annual inc ome , but only up to $75,000. The a verage incre ase in rep orted well-b eing
for p eople with inc omes gre ater than $75,000 w as null . As impla usible as these findings might seem—a fter all ,
higher inc omes w ould ena ble p eople to indulg e in Ha waiian v acations , prime se ats as sp orting ev ents ,
expensiv e automobiles , and e xpansiv e new homes —higher inc omes ma y imp air p eople ’s ability to sa vor and
enjo y the small ple asures o f life (K ahneman , 2011). Indee d, rese archers in one s tudy f ound tha t particip ants
exposed to a subliminal reminder o f wealth sp ent les s time sa voring a cho colate candy b ar and e xhibite d les s
enjo yment o f this e xperienc e than did p articip ants who w ere not reminde d of wealth (Quoidb ach, Dunn ,
Petrides , & Mik olajczak , 2010).
Wha t about e ducation and emplo yment? Happ y people , comp ared to those who are les s happ y, are more lik ely
to gradua te from c olleg e and secure more me aningful and eng aging jobs . Onc e the y obtain a job , the y are also
more lik ely to suc ceed (Lyub omirsky et al ., 2005). While e duc ation sho ws a p ositiv e (but w eak) c orrela tion with
happines s, intellig ence is not apprecia bly rela ted to happines s (Diener et al ., 1999).
Does religiosity c orrela te with happines s? In g eneral , the ans wer is y es (Hackne y & Sanders , 2003). Ho wever,
the rela tionship b etween religiosity and happines s dep ends on so cietal circums tanc es. Nations and s tates with
more difficult living c onditions (e .g., widespre ad hung er and lo w lif e expectancy ) tend to b e more highly
religious than so cieties with more fa vorable living c onditions . Among those who liv e in na tions with difficult
living c onditions , religiosity is as sociated with gre ater w ell-b eing; in na tions with more fa vorable living
conditions , religious and nonreligious individuals rep ort similar lev els o f well-b eing (Diener , Tay, & My ers,14.5 • The Pursuit o f Happines s523
2011).
Clearly the living c onditions o f one ’s na tion c an influenc e factors rela ted to happines s. Wha t about the
influenc e of one ’s culture? T o the e xtent tha t people p ossess characteris tics tha t are highly v alue d by their
culture , the y tend to b e happier (Diener , 2012). F or e xample , self -esteem is a s trong er pre dictor o f life
satisfaction in individualis tic cultures than in c ollectivis tic cultures (Diener , Diener , & Diener , 1995), and
extra verted people tend to b e happier in e xtra verted cultures than in intro verted cultures (F ulmer et al ., 2010).
So w e’ve identifie d man y factors tha t exhibit some c orrela tion to happines s. Wha t factors don ’t sho w a
correla tion? R esearchers ha ve studie d both p arentho od and ph ysical attractiv enes s as p otential c ontributors
to happines s, but no link has b een identifie d. Although p eople tend to b eliev e tha t parentho od is c entral to a
meaningful and fulfilling lif e, aggreg ate findings from a rang e of countries indic ate tha t people who do not
have children are g enerally happier than those who do (Hansen , 2012). And although one ’s perceived lev el of
attractiv enes s seems to pre dict happines s, a p erson ’s objectiv e ph ysical attractiv enes s is only w eakly
correla ted with their happines s (Diener , Wolsic , & F ujita, 1995).
Life Events and Happiness
An imp ortant p oint should b e considere d reg arding happines s. People are o ften p oor a t affectiv e forec asting:
predicting the intensity and dura tion o f their future emotions ( Wilson & Gilb ert, 2003). In one s tudy , nearly all
newly wed sp ouses pre dicte d their marital sa tisfaction w ould remain s table or impro ve over the f ollowing f our
years; despite this high lev el of initial optimism , their marital sa tisfaction actually decline d during this p erio d
(Lavner , Karner , & Bradbur y, 2013). In addition , we are o ften inc orrect when es tima ting ho w our long-term
happines s would chang e for the b etter or w orse in resp onse to c ertain lif e ev ents . For e xample , it is e asy for
man y of us to ima gine ho w euphoric w e would f eel if w e won the lot tery, were ask ed on a da te by an a ttractiv e
celebrity , or w ere o ffered our dre am job . It is also e asy to unders tand ho w long-suff ering fans o f the Chic ago
Cubs b aseb all te am, which had not w on a W orld Series championship sinc e 1908, thought the y would f eel
permanently ela ted when their te am finally w on another W orld Series in 2016. Lik ewise , it is e asy to pre dict
that we would f eel p ermanently misera ble if w e suff ered a disa bling ac cident or if a romantic rela tionship
ende d.
However, something similar to sensor y adapta tion o ften o ccurs when p eople e xperienc e emotional re actions
to lif e ev ents . In much the same w ay our senses adapt to chang es in s timula tion (e .g., our e yes adapting to
bright light a fter w alking out o f the darknes s of a mo vie the ater into the bright a fterno on sun), w e ev entually
adapt to changing emotional circums tanc es in our liv es (Brickman & C ampb ell, 1971; Helson , 1964). When an
event tha t pro vokes p ositiv e or neg ative emotions o ccurs , at firs t we tend to e xperienc e its emotional imp act a t
full intensity . We feel a burs t of ple asure f ollowing such things as a marria ge prop osal , bir th o f a child ,
acceptanc e to la w scho ol, an inheritanc e, and the lik e; as y ou might ima gine , lottery winners e xperienc e a
surg e of happines s after hit ting the jackp ot (L utter, 2007). Lik ewise , we experienc e a surg e of miser y following
wido who od, a div orce, or a la yoff from w ork. In the long r un, however, we ev entually adjus t to the emotional
new normal; the emotional imp act o f the ev ent tends to ero de, and w e ev entually rev ert to our original b aseline
happines s lev els. Thus , wha t was a t firs t a thrilling lot tery windfall or W orld Series championship ev entually
loses its lus ter and b ecomes the s tatus quo ( Figure 14.27 ). Indee d, drama tic lif e ev ents ha ve much les s long-

Recently , some ha ve raise d ques tions c oncerning the e xtent to which imp ortant lif e ev ents c an p ermanently

sugg ests tha t, in some circums tanc es, happines s lev els do not rev ert to their original p ositions . For e xample ,
although p eople g enerally tend to adapt to marria ge so tha t it no long er mak es them happier or unhappier
than b efore, the y often do not fully adapt to unemplo yment or sev ere disa bilities (Diener , 2012). Figure 14.28 ,
which is b ased on longitudinal da ta from a sample o f over 3,000 German resp ondents , sho ws life sa tisfaction
scores sev eral y ears b efore, during , and a fter v arious lif e ev ents , and it illus trates ho w people adapt (or fail to
adapt) to these ev ents . German resp ondents did not g et las ting emotional b oosts from marria ge; ins tead, the y
reported brief incre ases in happines s, followed by quick adapta tion . In c ontras t, wido ws and those who had
been laid o ff experienc ed siz eable decre ases in happines s tha t app eared to result in long-term chang es in lif e
satisfaction (Diener et al ., 2006). F urther , longitudinal da ta from the same sample sho wed tha t happines s

(Fujita & Diener , 2005). Thus , long-term happines s lev els c an and do chang e for some p eople .

Incr easing Happiness
Some rec ent findings a bout happines s pro vide an optimis tic picture , sugg esting tha t real chang es in happines s

(Diener et al ., 2006). R esearchers in one s tudy f ound tha t a series o f happines s inter ventions in volving such

Measuring happines sand w ell-b eing a t the so cietal lev el over time ma y as sist policy mak ers in determining if

Positive Psychology
In 1998, Seligman (the same p erson who c onducte d the le arne d helples snes s experiments mentione d earlier),
who w as then president o f the Americ an P sychologic al As sociation , urg ed ps ychologis ts to f ocus more on
unders tanding ho w to build human s trength and ps ychologic al w ell-b eing . In delib erately set ting out to cre ate
a new direction and new orienta tion f or ps ycholog y, Seligman help ed es tablish a gro wing mo vement and field
of rese arch c alled positiv e ps ycholog y (Compton , 2005). In a v ery general sense ,posit ive psy cholog ycan b e
thought o f as the scienc e of happines s; it is an are a of study tha t seeks to identif y and promote those qualities
that lead to gre ater fulfillment in our liv es. This field lo oks a t people ’s strengths and wha t helps individuals to
lead happ y, contente d liv es, and it mo ves a way from f ocusing on p eople ’s patholog y, faults , and problems .
According to Seligman and Csiks zentmihalyi (2000), p ositiv e ps ycholog y,
at the subjectiv e lev el is a bout v alue d subjectiv e experienc es: w ell-b eing , contentment , and
satisfaction (in the p ast); hop e and optimism (f or the future); and … happines s (in the present). A t the
individual lev el, it is a bout p ositiv e individual traits: the c apacity f or lo ve and v ocation , coura ge,
interp ersonal skill , aes thetic sensibility , persev eranc e, forgiv enes s, originality , future minde dnes s,
spirituality , high talent , and wisdom . (p. 5)
Some o f the topics s tudie d by positiv e ps ychologis ts include altr uism and emp athy, cre ativity , forgiv enes s and
comp assion , the imp ortanc e of positiv e emotions , enhanc ement o f immune s ystem functioning , savoring the
fleeting moments o f life, and s trengthening vir tues as a w ay to incre ase a uthentic happines s (Compton , 2005).
Recent eff orts in the field o f positiv e ps ycholog y ha ve focuse d on e xtending its principles to ward p eace and
well-b eing a t the lev el of the glob al community . In a w ar-torn w orld in which c onflict , hatred, and dis trust are

Positive Aff ect and Optimism
Taking a cue from p ositiv e ps ycholog y, extensiv e rese arch o ver the las t 10-15 y ears has e xamine d the
imp ortanc e of positiv e ps ychologic al attributes in ph ysical w ell-b eing . Qualities tha t help promote
psychologic al w ell-b eing (e .g., ha ving me aning and purp ose in lif e, a sense o f autonom y, positiv e emotions ,
and sa tisfaction with lif e) are link ed with a rang e of favorable he alth outc omes (esp ecially impro ved
cardio vascular he alth) mainly through their rela tionships with biologic al functions and he alth b ehaviors (such
as diet , physical activity , and sleep quality ) (Bo ehm & K ubzansky , 2012). The quality tha t has rec eived attention
isposit ive aff ect, which ref ers to ple asura ble eng agement with the en vironment , such as happines s, joy,
enthusiasm , aler tnes s, and e xcitement ( Watson , Clark , & T elleg en, 1988). The characteris tics o f positiv e affect,
as with neg ative affect (discus sed earlier), c an b e brief, long-las ting , or trait -like (Pressman & C ohen , 2005).
Indep endent o f age, gender , and inc ome , positiv e affect is as sociated with gre ater so cial c onnecte dnes s,
emotional and practic al supp ort, adaptiv e coping eff orts, and lo wer depres sion; it is also as sociated with
long evity and fa vorable ph ysiologic al functioning (Stepto e, O’Donnell , Marmot , & W ardle , 2008).
Positiv e affect also ser ves as a protectiv e factor a gains t he art dise ase. In a 10- year study o f Nova Sc otians , the
rate of he art dise ase w as 22% lo wer for e ach one -point incre ase on the me asure o f positiv e affect, from 1 (no
positiv e affect e xpres sed) to 5 (e xtreme p ositiv e affect) (Da vidson , Mos tofsky , & Whang , 2010). In terms o f our
health , the e xpres sion , “don ’t worry, be happ y” is helpful advic e indee d. There has also b een much w ork
sugg esting tha toptimism —the g eneral tendency to lo ok on the bright side o f things —is also a signific ant
predictor o f positiv e he alth outc omes .
Although p ositiv e affect and optimism are rela ted in some w ays, the y are not the same (P ressman & C ohen ,
2005). Where as p ositiv e affect is mos tly c oncerne d with p ositiv e feeling s tates, optimism has b een reg arde d as
a generaliz ed tendency to e xpect tha t good things will happ en (Chang , 2001). It has also b een c onceptualiz ed
as a tendency to view lif e’s stres sors and difficulties as temp orar y and e xternal to oneself (P eterson & Steen ,
2002). Numerous s tudies o ver the y ears ha ve consis tently sho wn tha t optimism is link ed to long evity , healthier
behaviors , fewer p ostsurgic al complic ations , better immune functioning among men with pros tate cancer, and
better tre atment adherenc e (Rasmus sen & W allio , 2008). F urther , optimis tic p eople rep ort fewer ph ysical
symptoms , les s pain, better ph ysical functioning , and are les s lik ely to b e rehospitaliz ed following he art
surg ery (Rasmus sen, Scheier , & Greenhouse , 2009).
Flow
Another factor tha t seems to b e imp ortant in f ostering a deep sense o f well-b eing is the a bility to deriv e flo w
from the things w e do in lif e.Flowis describ ed as a p articular e xperienc e tha t is so eng aging and engros sing
that it b ecomes w orth doing f or its o wn sak e (Csiks zentmihalyi , 1997). It is usually rela ted to cre ative
ende avors and leisure activities , but it c an also b e experienc ed by workers who lik e their jobs or s tudents who
love studying (Csiks zentmihalyi , 1999). Man y of us ins tantly rec ogniz e the notion o f flo w. In fact , the term
deriv ed from resp ondents’ sp ontaneous use o f the term when ask ed to describ e ho w it f elt when wha t the y
were doing w as g oing w ell. When p eople e xperienc e flo w, the y become in volved in an activity to the p oint
where the y feel the y lose themselv es in the activity . The y eff ortlessly maintain their c oncentra tion and f ocus,
they feel as though the y ha ve complete c ontrol o f their actions , and time seems to p ass more quickly than
usual (Csiks zentmihalyi , 1997). Flo w is c onsidere d a ple asura ble e xperienc e, and it typic ally o ccurs when
people are eng aged in challenging activities tha t require skills and kno wledge the y kno w the y possess. For
example , people w ould b e more lik ely rep ort flo w experienc es in rela tion to their w ork or hobbies than in14.5 • The Pursuit o f Happines s527
rela tion to e ating . When ask ed the ques tion , “Do y ou ev er g et in volved in something so deeply tha t nothing else
seems to ma tter, and y ou lose track o f time? ” about 20% o f Americ ans and Europ eans rep ort ha ving these
flow-lik e experienc es regularly (Csiks zentmihalyi , 1997).
Although w ealth and ma terial p ossessions are nic e to ha ve, the notion o f flo w sugg ests tha t neither are
prere quisites f or a happ y and fulfilling lif e. Finding an activity tha t you are tr uly enthusias tic a bout, something
so a bsorbing tha t doing it is rew ard itself ( whether it b e pla ying tennis , studying Ara bic, writing children ’s
novels, or c ooking la vish me als) is p erhaps the re al key. According to Csiks zentmihalyi (1999), cre ating
conditions tha t mak e flo w experienc es p ossible should b e a top so cial and p olitic al priority . Ho w might this
goal be achiev ed? Ho w might flo w be promote d in scho ol systems? In the w orkplac e? Wha t potential b enefits
might b e ac crued from such eff orts?
In an ide al w orld , scientific rese arch ende avors should inf orm us on ho w to bring a bout a b etter w orld f or all
people . The field o f positiv e ps ycholog y promises to b e ins trumental in helping us unders tand wha t truly
builds hop e, optimism , happines s, health y rela tionships , flow, and g enuine p ersonal fulfillment .528 14 • S tress, Lifestyle, and Heal th

Summary
14.1 What Is Str ess?
Stres s is a pro cess whereb y an individual p erceives and resp onds to ev ents appraise d as o verwhelming or
thre atening to one ’s well-b eing . The scientific s tudy o f ho w stres s and emotional factors imp act he alth and
well-b eing is c alled he alth ps ycholog y, a field dev oted to s tudying the g eneral imp act o f psychologic al factors
on he alth . The b ody’s primar y ph ysiologic al resp onse during s tres s, the fight -or-flight resp onse , was firs t
identifie d in the e arly 20th c entur y by Walter C annon . The fight -or-flight resp onse in volves the c oordina ted
activity o f both the s ymp athetic ner vous s ystem and the h ypothalamic -pituitar y-adrenal (HP A) axis . Hans
Sely e, a note d endo crinologis t, ref erre d to these ph ysiologic al re actions to s tres s as p art of general adapta tion
syndrome , which o ccurs in three s tages: alarm re action (fight -or-flight re actions b egin), resis tanc e (the b ody
begins to adapt to c ontinuing s tres s), and e xhaustion (adaptiv e energ y is deplete d, and s tres s begins to tak e a
physical toll).
14.2 Stressors
Stres sors c an b e chronic ( long term) or acute (shor t term), and c an include tra uma tic ev ents , signific ant lif e
chang es, daily has sles , and situa tions in which p eople are fre quently e xposed to challenging and unple asant
events . Man y potential s tres sors include ev ents or situa tions tha t require us to mak e chang es in our liv es, such

14.3 Stress and Illness
Psychoph ysiologic al disorders are ph ysical dise ases tha t are either brought a bout or w orsene d by stres s and
other emotional factors . One o f the mechanisms through which s tres s and emotional factors c an influenc e the
development o f these dise ases is b y adv ersely a ffecting the b ody’s immune s ystem . A numb er o f studies ha ve
demons trated tha t stres s weakens the functioning o f the immune s ystem . Cardio vascular disorders are serious
medical conditions tha t ha ve been c onsis tently sho wn to b e influenc ed by stres s and neg ative emotions , such
as ang er, neg ative affectivity , and depres sion . Other ps ychoph ysiologic al disorders tha t are kno wn to b e
influenc ed by stres s and emotional factors include as thma and tension he adaches .
14.4 Regulation of Str ess
When fac ed with s tres s, people mus t attempt to mana ge or c ope with it . In g eneral , there are tw o basic f orms o f
coping: problem-f ocuse d coping and emotion-f ocuse d coping . Those who use problem-f ocuse d coping
strategies tend to c ope better with s tres s because these s trategies addres s the sourc e of stres s rather than the
resulting s ymptoms . To a larg e extent , perceived control gre atly imp acts re action to s tres sors and is as sociated

15.1 What Ar e Psychological Disor ders?
LEARNING OBJEC TIVES
By the end o f this section, y ou wil l be able t o:
•Unders tand the pr oblems inher ent in defining the c oncept of psychological disor der
•Describe what is meant b y harmful dy sfunction
•Identif y the f ormal crit eria that thoughts , feelings , and beha viors mus t meet t o be c onsider ed abnormal and,
thus , symp tomatic o f a ps ychological disor der
According to the Americ an P sychia tric As sociation , apsychologic al disorder , or mental disorder , is “ a
syndrome characteriz ed by clinic ally signific ant dis turb ance in an individual's c ognition , emotion regula tion ,
or b ehavior tha t reflects a dy sfunction in the ps ychologic al, biologic al, or dev elopmental pro cesses underlying
mental functioning . Mental disorders are usually as sociated with signific ant dis tres s in so cial, occup ational , or
other imp ortant activities” (2013). Psychop atholog yis the s tudy o f psychologic al disorders , including their
symptoms ,etiolog y(i.e., their c auses), and tre atment . The term psychop atholog ycan also ref er to the
manif estation o f a ps ychologic al disorder . Although c onsensus c an b e difficult , it is e xtremely imp ortant f or
mental he alth pro fessionals to a gree on wha t kinds o f thoughts , feelings , and b ehaviors are tr uly a bnormal in
the sense tha t the y genuinely indic ate the presenc e of psychop atholog y. Certain p atterns o f behavior and inner
experienc e can e asily b e labeled as a bnormal and cle arly signif y some kind o f psychologic al dis turb ance. The
person who w ashes their hands 40 times p er da y and the p erson who claims to he ar the v oices o f demons
exhibit b ehaviors and inner e xperienc es tha t mos t would reg ard as a bnormal: b eliefs and b ehaviors tha t
sugg est the e xistenc e of a ps ychologic al disorder . But, consider the ner vousnes s a y oung man f eels when
talking to an a ttractiv e person or the lonelines s and longing f or home a firs t-year student e xperienc es during
her firs t semes ter o f colleg e—these f eelings ma y not b e regularly present , but the y fall in the rang e of normal .
So, wha t kinds o f thoughts , feelings , and b ehaviors represent a tr ue ps ychologic al disorder? P sychologis ts w ork
to dis tinguish ps ychologic al disorders from inner e xperienc es and b ehaviors tha t are merely situa tional ,
idios yncra tic, or unc onventional .
Mental he alth is sues are o ften inc orrectly view ed as les s imp ortant than ph ysical illnes ses, and sometimes
people are blame d or other wise s tigma tized for their c ondition . People with mental illnes ses did not cho ose or
create their illnes s, and c annot simply mana ge it through p ositiv e thinking or other a ttitudinal chang es.
Diagnosis , tre atment , and supp ort are all nec essary, and all mus t be considere d with resp ect and sensitivity to
the e xtremely challenging na ture o f mental illnes s. While not ev eryone e xperiencing difficulty has a
psychologic al disorder , mental he alth is critic al to our a bility to function in our rela tionships , educ ation , and
work. It is imp ortant tha t people talk with qualifie d pro fessionals if the y are ha ving p ersis tent f eelings or
experienc es in line with the descriptions b elow; the discus sion ma y or ma y not le ad to a dia gnosis , but as with
physical illnes ses, one has a b etter chanc e at suc cess if the y raise the is sues with do ctors or other e xperts.
Definition of a Psychological Disor der
Perhaps the simples t appro ach to c onceptualizing ps ychologic al disorders is to la bel behaviors , thoughts , and
inner e xperienc es tha t are a typic al, dis tres sful, dysfunctional , and sometimes ev en dang erous , as signs o f a
disorder . For e xample , if y ou ask a clas sma te for a da te and y ou are rejecte d, you prob ably w ould f eel a lit tle
dejecte d. Such f eelings w ould b e normal . If y ou f elt e xtremely depres sed—so much so tha t you los t interes t in
activities , had difficulty e ating or sleeping , felt ut terly w orthles s, and c ontempla ted suicide —your f eelings
would b eatypic al, would devia te from the norm , and c ould signif y the presenc e of a ps ychologic al disorder .
Just because something is a typic al, however, does not nec essarily me an it is disordere d.
For e xample , only a bout 4% o f people in the Unite d Sta tes ha ve re d hair , so re d hair is c onsidere d an a typic al
characteris tic ( Figure 15.2 ), but it is not c onsidere d disordere d, it’s jus t unusual . And it is les s unusual in
Scotland , where appro xima tely 13% o f the p opula tion has re d hair (“DN A Project Aims ,” 2012). As y ou will
learn, some disorders , although not e xactly typic al, are far from a typic al, and the ra tes in which the y app ear in
the p opula tion are surprisingly high .538 15 • P sychological Disor ders

work b y Glyn L owe; cr edit c: modification o f work b y Kirk W eaver)
If we can a gree tha t merely b eing a typic al is an insufficient criterion f or a ha ving a ps ychologic al disorder , is it
reasona ble to c onsider b ehavior or inner e xperienc es tha t diff er from widely e xpecte d cultural v alues or
expecta tions as disordere d? U sing this criterion , a p erson who w alks around a sub way pla tform w earing a
heavy winter c oat in J uly while scre aming obsc enities a t strang ers ma y be considere d as e xhibiting s ymptoms
of a ps ychologic al disorder . Their actions and clothes viola te so cially ac cepte d rules g overning appropria te
dres s and b ehavior; these characteris tics are a typic al.
Cultur al Expectations
Violating cultural e xpecta tions is not , in and o f itself, a sa tisfactor y me ans o f identif ying the presenc e of a
psychologic al disorder . Sinc e behavior v aries from one culture to another , wha t ma y be expecte d and
considere d appropria te in one culture ma y not b e view ed as such in other cultures . For e xample , returning a
strang er’s smile is e xpecte d in the Unite d Sta tes b ecause a p ervasiv e so cial norm dicta tes tha t we recipro cate
friendly g estures . A p erson who refuses to ackno wledge such g estures might b e considere d so cially
awkw ard—p erhaps ev en disordere d—for viola ting this e xpecta tion . Ho wever, such e xpecta tions are not
univ ersally share d. Cultural e xpecta tions in J apan in volve sho wing reser ve, res traint , and a c oncern f or
maintaining priv acy around s trang ers. Japanese p eople are g enerally unresp onsiv e to smiles from s trang ers
(Patterson et al ., 2007). Ey e contact pro vides another e xample . In the Unite d Sta tes and Europ e, eye contact
with others typic ally signifies hones ty and a ttention . Ho wever, mos t Latin-Americ an, Asian , and Afric an
cultures interpret direct e ye contact as r ude , confronta tional , and a ggres sive (Pazain , 2010). Thus , someone
who mak es e ye contact with y ou c ould b e considere d appropria te and resp ectful or braz en and o ffensiv e,

The Myth of Mental Illness
In the 1950s and 1960s , the c oncept of mental il lnes s was widel y criticiz ed. One o f the major criticisms f ocused
on the notion that mental il lnes s was a “ myth that jus tifies ps ychiatric int ervention in social ly disappr oved
beha vior” (Wakefield, 1992). Thomas Szas z (1960), a not ed ps ychiatris t, was perhaps the big gest proponent o f
this vie w. Szas z argued that the notion o f mental il lnes s was in vented b y society (and the mental heal th
establishment) t o stigmatiz e and subjug ate people whose beha vior violat es ac cepted social and leg al norms .
Indeed, Szas z sug gested that what appear t o be s ymp toms o f mental il lnes s are mor e appr opriat ely
char acterized as “ problems in living ” (Szas z, 1960).
In his 1961 book, The Myth o f Mental Il lnes s: Foundations o f a Theor y of Personal Conduct , Szas z expressed his
disdain f or the c oncept of mental il lnes s and f or the field o f psychiatr y in g ener al (Oliv er, 2006). The basis f or
Szas z’s attack w as his c ontention that det ectable abnormalities in bodil y structur es and functions (e .g.,
infections and or gan damag e or dy sfunction) r epresent the defining f eatur es o f genuine il lnes s or disease , and
because s ymp toms o f purpor ted mental il lnes s are not ac companied b y such det ectable abnormalities , so-called
psychological disor ders ar e not disor ders at al l. Szas z (1961/2010) pr oclaimed that “ disease or il lnes s can onl y
affect the body; henc e, ther e can be no mental il lnes s” (p . 267).
Today, we recogniz e the e xtreme le vel of psychological suff ering e xperienc ed b y people with ps ychological
disor ders: the painful thoughts and f eelings the y experienc e, the disor dered beha vior the y demons trate, and the
levels o f dis tress and impairment the y exhibit. This mak es it v ery difficul t to den y the r eality o f mental il lnes s.
However contr oversial Szas z’s vie ws and those o f his suppor ters might ha ve been, the y ha ve influenc ed the
mental heal th community and society in se veral w ays. Firs t, lay people , politicians , and pr ofessionals no w often
refer to mental il lnes s as mental heal th “problems ,” implicitl y ackno wledging the “ problems in living ”
perspectiv e Szas z described (Buchanan-Bark er & Bark er, 2009). Also influential w as Szas z’s vie w of sexual
orientation. Szas z was perhaps the firs t psychiatris t to openl y chal leng e the idea that same -sex attraction
represent ed a f orm o f mental il lnes s or disease (Szas z, 1965), which helped pa ve the w ay for the social and civil
rights that g ay and lesbian people no w ha ve (Bark er, 2010). His w ork also inspir ed leg al chang es that pr otect the
rights o f people in ps ychiatric ins titutions and al low such individuals a gr eater degr ee o f influenc e and
responsibility o ver their liv es (Buchanan-Bark er & Bark er, 2009).
Harmful Dysfunction
If none o f the criterion discus sed so far is ade qua te by itself to define the presenc e of a ps ychologic al disorder ,
how can a disorder b e conceptualiz ed? Man y eff orts ha ve been made to identif y the sp ecific dimensions o f
psychologic al disorders , yet none is entirely sa tisfactor y. No univ ersal definition o f psychologic al disorder
exists tha t can apply to all situa tions in which a disorder is thought to b e present (Zachar & K endler , 2007).
However, one o f the more influential c onceptualiza tions w as prop osed by Wakefield (1992), who define d
psychologic al disorder as a harmful dy sfunct ion. Wakefield argue d tha t na tural internal mechanisms —tha t is,
psychologic al pro cesses hone d by ev olution , such as c ognition , perception , and le arning—ha ve imp ortant
functions , such as ena bling us to e xperienc e the w orld the w ay others do and to eng age in ra tional thought ,
problem solving , and c ommunic ation . For e xample , learning allo ws us to as sociate a f ear with a p otentialDIG DEEPER540 15 • P sychological Disor ders

dang er in such a w ay tha t the intensity o f fear is roughly e qual to the degree o f actual dang er. Dysfunction
occurs when an internal mechanism bre aks do wn and c an no long er p erform its normal function . But, the
presenc e of a dy sfunction b y itself do es not determine a disorder . The dy sfunction mus t be harmful in tha t it
leads to neg ative conse quenc es for the individual or f or others , as judg ed by the s tandards o f the individual ’s
culture . The harm ma y include signific ant internal anguish (e .g., high lev els o f anxiety or depres sion) or
problems in da y-to-day living (e .g., in one ’s so cial or w ork lif e).

signals tha t the internal mechanism o f learning is not w orking c orrectly (i .e., a fa ulty pro cess prev ents J anet
from appropria tely as sociating the ma gnitude o f fear with the actual thre at posed by spiders). J anet ’s fear o f
spiders has a signific ant neg ative influenc e on daily lif e: she a voids all situa tions in which she susp ects spiders
to b e present (e .g., the b asement or a friend ’s home), and she quit her job las t month b ecause she sa w a spider
in the res troom a t work and is no w unemplo yed. According to the harmful dy sfunction mo del, Janet ’s
condition w ould signif y a disorder b ecause (a) there is a dy sfunction in an internal mechanism , and ( b) the
dysfunction has resulte d in harmful c onse quenc es. Similar to ho w the s ymptoms o f ph ysical illnes s reflect
dysfunctions in biologic al pro cesses, the s ymptoms o f psychologic al disorders presuma bly reflect
dysfunctions in mental pro cesses. The internal mechanism c omp onent o f this mo del is esp ecially app ealing
because it implies tha t disorders ma y occur through a bre akdown o f biologic al functions tha t govern v arious
psychologic al pro cesses, thus supp orting c ontemp orar y neurobiologic al mo dels o f psychologic al disorders
(Fabreg a, 2007).
The American Psychiatric Association (AP A) Definition
Man y of the f eatures o f the harmful dy sfunction mo del are inc orporated in a f ormal definition o f psychologic al
disorder dev elop ed by the Americ an P sychia tric As sociation (APA). A ccording to the AP A (2013), a
psychologic al disorder is a c ondition tha t is said to c onsis t of the f ollowing:
•There are signific ant dis turb anc es in thoughts, f eelings, and b eha viors . A p erson mus t experienc e
inner s tates (e .g., thoughts and/or f eelings) and e xhibit b ehaviors tha t are cle arly dis turb ed—tha t is,
unusual , but in a neg ative, self -def eating w ay. Often , such dis turb ances are troubling to those around the
individual who e xperienc es them . For e xample , an individual who is unc ontrolla bly preo ccupie d by
thoughts o f germs sp ends hours e ach da y bathing , has inner e xperienc es, and displa ys behaviors tha t
mos t would c onsider a typic al and neg ative (dis turb ed) and tha t would lik ely b e troubling to family
memb ers.
•The dis turb anc es reflect some kind of biologic al, psy chologic al, or de velopmental dy sfunct ion.
Disturb ed patterns o f inner e xperienc es and b ehaviors should reflect some fla w (dy sfunction) in the
internal biologic al, psychologic al, and dev elopmental mechanisms tha t lead to normal , health y
psychologic al functioning . For e xample , the hallucina tions obser ved in schiz ophrenia c ould b e a sign o f
brain a bnormalities .
•The dis turb anc es le ad to signific ant dis tres s or disabilit y in one ’s lif e. A p erson ’s inner e xperienc es and
behaviors are c onsidere d to reflect a ps ychologic al disorder if the y cause the p erson c onsidera ble dis tres s,
or gre atly imp air their a bility to function as a normal individual (o ften ref erre d to as functional
imp airment , or o ccup ational and so cial imp airment). As an illus tration , a p erson ’s fear o f social situa tions
might b e so dis tres sing tha t it c auses the p erson to a void all so cial situa tions (e .g., prev enting tha t person
from b eing a ble to a ttend clas s or apply f or a job).
•The dis turb anc es do not reflect e xpecte d or culturally appro ved resp onses to c ertain e vents .
Disturb ances in thoughts , feelings , and b ehaviors mus t be so cially unac cepta ble resp onses to c ertain
events tha t often happ en in lif e. For e xample , it is p erfectly na tural (and e xpecte d) tha t a p erson w ould
experienc e gre at sadnes s and might wish to b e left alone f ollowing the de ath o f a close family memb er.
Because such re actions are in some w ays culturally e xpecte d, the individual w ould not b e as sume d to
signif y a mental disorder .15.1 • Wha t Are Psychological Disor ders? 541
Some b eliev e tha t there is no es sential criterion or set o f criteria tha t can definitiv ely dis tinguish all c ases o f
disorder from nondisorder (Lilienf eld & Marino , 1999). In tr uth, no single appro ach to defining a ps ychologic al
disorder is ade qua te by itself, nor is there univ ersal a greement on where the b oundar y is b etween disordere d
and not disordere d. From time to time w e all e xperienc e anxiety , un wante d thoughts , and moments o f
sadnes s; our b ehavior a t other times ma y not mak e much sense to ourselv es or to others . These inner
experienc es and b ehaviors c an v ary in their intensity , but are only c onsidere d disordere d when the y are highly
disturbing to us and/or others , sugg est a dy sfunction in normal mental functioning , and are as sociated with
signific ant dis tres s or disa bility in so cial or o ccup ational activities .

•Discus s chang es in the DSM o ver time , including criticisms o f the curr ent edition
•Identif y which disor ders ar e gener ally the mos t common
A firs t step in the s tudy o f psychologic al disorders is c arefully and s ystema tically disc erning signific ant signs
and s ymptoms . Ho w do mental he alth pro fessionals asc ertain whether or not a p erson ’s inner s tates and
behaviors tr uly represent a ps ychologic al disorder? Arriving a t a prop erdiagnosis —tha t is, appropria tely
identif ying and la beling a set o f define d symptoms —is a bsolutely cr ucial . This pro cess ena bles pro fessionals to
use a c ommon langua ge with others in the field and aids in c ommunic ation a bout the disorder with the
patient , colleagues and the public . A prop er dia gnosis is an es sential element to guide prop er and suc cessful
treatment . For these re asons , clas sific ation s ystems tha t org aniz e ps ychologic al disorders s ystema tically are
necessary.
The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disor ders (DSM)
Although a numb er o f clas sific ation s ystems ha ve been dev elop ed over time , the one tha t is use d by mos t
mental he alth pro fessionals in the Unite d Sta tes is the Diagnos tic and Stat istical Manual of Mental Disorders
(DSM-5) , publishe d by the Americ an P sychia tric As sociation (2013). (N ote tha t the Americ an P sychia tric
Association diff ers from the Americ an P sychologic al As sociation; b oth are a bbrevia ted AP A.) The firs t edition
of the DSM, publishe d in 1952, clas sifie d ps ychologic al disorders ac cording to a f orma t dev elop ed by the U .S.
Arm y during W orld W ar II (Clegg , 2012). In the y ears sinc e, the DSM has underg one numerous revisions and
editions . The mos t rec ent e dition , publishe d in 2013, is the DSM-5 (AP A, 2013). The DSM-5 includes man y
categories o f disorders (e .g., anxiety disorders , depres sive disorders , and dis sociative disorders). Each
disorder is describ ed in detail , including an o verview o f the disorder (dia gnos tic f eatures), sp ecific s ymptoms
require d for dia gnosis (dia gnos tic criteria), prev alenc e inf orma tion ( wha t percent o f the p opula tion is thought
to b e afflicte d with the disorder), and risk factors as sociated with the disorder .Figure 15.4 shows lifetime

The DSM-5 also pro vides inf orma tion a bout comorbidit y; the c o-occurrenc e of two disorders . For e xample , the
DSM-5 mentions tha t 41% o f people with obses sive-compulsiv e disorder (O CD) also meet the dia gnos tic
criteria f or major depres sive disorder ( Figure 15.5 ). Problema tic subs tanc e use is highly c omorbid with other
mental illnes ses; 6 out o f 10 p eople who ha ve a subs tanc e use disorder also suff er from another f orm o f mental

As y ou’ve learned in the t ext, c omorbidity r efers t o situations in which an individual suff ers fr om mor e than one
disor der, and o ften the s ymp toms o f each can int eract in neg ative ways. Co-occurr ence and c omorbidity o f

disor ders that c o-occur with ps ychological disor ders . Indeed, some es timat es sug gest that ar ound a quar ter of

people who suff er fr om the mos t severe cases o f mental il lnes s exhibit subs tanc e use disor der as w ell. Con versel y,
around 10 per cent o f individuals seeking tr eatment f or subs tanc e use disor der ha ve serious mental il lnes ses.
Obser vations such as these ha ve impor tant implications f or tr eatment op tions that ar e available . When people with
a mental il lnes s are also habitual drug users , their s ymp toms can be e xacerbat ed and r esistant t o treatment.
Furthermor e, it is not al ways clear whether the s ymp toms ar e due t o drug use , the mental il lnes s, or a c ombination
of the tw o. Ther efore, it is r ecommended that beha vior is obser ved in situations in which the individual has c eased
using drugs and is no long er experiencing withdr awal from the drug in or der t o mak e the mos t accurate diagnosis
(NID A, 2018).
Obviousl y, subs tanc e use disor ders ar e not the onl y pos sible c omorbidities . In fact, some o f the mos t common
psychological disor ders t end t o co-occur. For ins tanc e, mor e than half o f individuals who ha ve a primar y diagnosis o f
depr essive disor der ar e es timat ed to exhibit some sor t of anxiety disor der. The r everse is also true f or those
diagnosed with a primar y diagnosis o f an anxiety disor der. Further, anxiety disor ders and major depr ession ha ve a
high r ate of comorbidity with se veral other ps ychological disor ders (Al -Asadi, Klein, & Me yer, 2015).
The DSM has chang ed considera bly in the half -centur y sinc e it w as originally publishe d. The firs t two editions
of the DSM, f or e xample , listed homose xuality as a disorder; ho wever, in 1973, the AP A voted to remo ve it from
the manual (Silv erstein , 2009). While the DSM-III did not lis t homose xuality as a disorder , it intro duced a new
diagnosis , ego-dystonic homose xuality , which emphasiz ed same -sex arousal tha t the p atient view ed as
inter fering with desire d heterose xual rela tionships and c ausing dis tres s for the individual . This new dia gnosis
was c onsidere d by man y as a c ompromise to app ease those who view ed homose xuality as a mental illnes s.
Other pro fessionals ques tione d ho w appropria te it w as to ha ve a sep arate dia gnosis tha t describ ed the c ontent
of an individual's dis tres s. In 1986, the dia gnosis w as remo ved from the DSM-III-R (Herek , 2012). A dditionally ,
beginning with the DSM-III in 1980, mental disorders ha ve been describ ed in much gre ater detail , and the
numb er o f dia gnosa ble c onditions has gro wn s teadily , as has the siz e of the manual itself. DSM-I include d 106
diagnoses and w as 130 total p ages, where as DSM-III include d more than 2 times as man y dia gnoses (265) and
was ne arly sev en times its siz e (886 total p ages) (Ma yes & Horo witz, 2005). A lthough DSM-5 is long er than
DSM-IV , the v olume includes only 237 disorders , a decre ase from the 297 disorders tha t were lis ted in DSM-IV .
The la test edition , DSM-5, includes revisions in the org aniza tion and naming o f categories and in the
diagnos tic criteria f or v arious disorders (R egier , Kuhl, & K upfer, 2012), while emphasizing c areful
considera tion o f the imp ortanc e of gender and cultural diff erenc e in the e xpres sion o f various s ymptoms
(Fisher , 2010).
Some b eliev e tha t establishing new dia gnoses might o verpathologiz e the human c ondition b y turning c ommon
human problems into mental illnes ses ( The As sociated Press, 2013). Indee d, the finding tha t ne arly half o f all
Americ ans will meet the criteria f or a DSM disorder a t some p oint in their lif e (K essler et al ., 2005) lik ely fuels
much o f this sk epticism . The DSM-5 is also criticiz ed on the grounds tha t its dia gnos tic criteria ha ve been
loosene d, thereb y thre atening to “ turn our current dia gnos tic infla tion into dia gnos tic h yperinfla tion ”
(Franc es, 2012, p ara. 22). F or e xample , DSM-IV sp ecifie d tha t the s ymptoms o f major depres sive disorder mus t
not b e attributa ble to normal b ereavement ( loss of a lo ved one). The DSM-5, ho wever, has remo ved this
bereavement e xclusion , essentially me aning tha t grief and sadnes s after a lo ved one ’s de ath can c onstitute
major depres sive disorder .
The International Classification of Diseases
A sec ond clas sific ation s ystem , the Internat ional Clas sific ation of Dise ases (ICD) , is also widely rec ogniz ed.
Publishe d by the W orld He alth Org aniza tion ( WHO), the ICD w as dev elop ed in Europ e shor tly a fter W orld W ar
II and , like the DSM, has b een revise d sev eral times . The c ategories o f psychologic al disorders in b oth the DSM
and ICD are similar , as are the criteria f or sp ecific disorders; ho wever, some diff erenc es e xist. Although the ICD
is use d for clinic al purp oses , this to ol is also use d to e xamine the g eneral he alth o f popula tions and to monitor
the prev alenc e of dise ases and other he alth problems interna tionally ( WHO , 2013). The ICD is in its 10th544 15 • P sychological Disor ders

edition (ICD -10); ho wever, efforts are no w under way to dev elop a new e dition (ICD -11) tha t, in c onjunction with
the chang es in DSM-5, will help harmoniz e the tw o clas sific ation s ystems as much as p ossible (AP A, 2013).
A study tha t comp ared the use o f the tw o clas sific ation s ystems f ound tha t worldwide the ICD is more
frequently use d for clinic al dia gnosis , where as the DSM is more v alue d for rese arch (Me zzich , 2002). Mos t
rese arch findings c oncerning the etiolog y and tre atment o f psychologic al disorders are b ased on criteria set
forth in the DSM (Oltmanns & C astongua y, 2013). The DSM also includes more e xplicit disorder criteria, along
with an e xtensiv e and helpful e xplana tory text (R egier et al ., 2012). The DSM is the clas sific ation s ystem o f
choic e among U .S. mental he alth pro fessionals , and this chapter is b ased on the DSM p aradigm .
The Compassionate View of Psychological Disor ders
As these disorders are outline d, ple ase b ear tw o things in mind . First, rememb er tha t psychologic al disorders
represent extremes of inner e xperienc e and b ehavior . If, while re ading a bout these disorders , you f eel tha t
these descriptions b egin to p ersonally characteriz e you, do not w orry—this moment o f enlightenment prob ably
means nothing more than y ou ha ve had a rang e of experienc es and emotions . Each o f us e xperienc es episo des
of sadnes s, anxiety , and preo ccup ation with c ertain thoughts —times when w e do not quite f eel ourselv es.
These episo des should not b e considere d problema tic unles s the ac comp anying thoughts and b ehaviors
become e xtreme and ha ve a disr uptiv e eff ect on one ’s life. Sec ond , unders tand tha t people with ps ychologic al
disorders are far more than jus t emb odiments o f their disorders . We do not use terms such as schiz ophrenics ,
depres sives, or phobics b ecause the y are la bels tha t objectif y people who ha ve these c onditions , thus
promoting biase d and disp araging as sumptions a bout them . It is imp ortant to rememb er tha t a ps ychologic al
disorder is not wha t a p erson is; it is something tha t a p erson has—through no fa ult o f their o wn. As is the c ase
with c ancer or dia betes , those with ps ychologic al disorders suff er debilita ting , often p ainful c onditions tha t are

Supernatur al P erspectives of Psychological Disor ders
For c enturies , psychologic al disorders w ere view ed from a sup ernatural persp ectiv e: attribute d to a f orce
beyond scientific unders tanding . Those a fflicte d were thought to b e practitioners o f black ma gic or p ossessed
by spirits ( Figure 15.6 ) (Maher & Maher , 1985). F or e xample , convents throughout Europ e in the 16th and 17th
centuries rep orted hundre ds o f nuns falling into a s tate of frenzy in which the a fflicte d foame d at the mouth ,
scre ame d and c onvulse d, sexually prop ositione d pries ts, and c onfessed to ha ving c arnal rela tions with devils
or Chris t. Although , today, these c ases w ould sugg est serious mental illnes s; at the time , these ev ents w ere
routinely e xplaine d as p ossession b y devilish f orces (Waller , 2009a). Similarly , griev ous fits b y young girls are
believ ed to ha ve precipita ted the witch p anic in N ew England la te in the 17th c entur y (Demos , 1983). Such
beliefs in sup erna tural c auses o f mental illnes s are s till held in some so cieties to day; for e xample , beliefs tha t
superna tural f orces c ause mental illnes s are c ommon in some cultures in mo dern-da y Nig eria (Aghukw a,15.3 • P erspectiv es on P sychological Disor ders 545

FIGURE 15.6 InThe Extr action o f the St one o f Madnes s, a 15th c entur y painting b y Hier onymus Bosch, a
practitioner is using a t ool t o extract an object (the supposed “ stone o f madnes s”) fr om the head o f an afflict ed
person.
Dancing Mania
Betw een the 11th and 17th c enturies , a curious epidemic s wept acr oss Western Eur ope. Groups o f people w ould
suddenl y begin t o danc e with wild abandon. This c ompulsion t o danc e—referred to as dancing
mania —sometimes gripped thousands o f people at a time ( Figure 15.7 ). His torical ac counts indicat e that those
afflict ed w ould sometimes danc e with bruised and bloody f eet f or da ys or w eeks, scr eaming o f terrible visions
and beg ging pries ts and monk s to sa ve their souls ( Waller, 2009b). What caused dancing mania is not kno wn, but
several explanations ha ve been pr oposed, including spider v enom and er got poisoning (“Dancing Mania ,” 2011).
FIGURE 15.7 Although the cause o f dancing mania , depict ed in this painting , was unclear , the beha vior w as

Historian John W aller (2009a , 2009b) has pr ovided a c ompr ehensiv e and c onvincing e xplanation o f dancing
mania that sug gests the phenomenon w as at tributable t o a c ombination o f thr ee fact ors: ps ychological dis tress,
social c ontagion, and belief in supernatur al forces. Waller ar gued that v arious disas ters o f the time (such as

people —belie ving themsel ves to ha ve been afflict ed with a dancing curse —to slip int o a spontaneous tr ance and
then act out the par t of one who is cursed b y dancing f or da ys on end.
Biological P erspectives of Psychological Disor ders
The biologic al persp ectiv e view s ps ychologic al disorders as link ed to biologic al phenomena, such as g enetic
factors , chemic al imb alanc es, and brain a bnormalities; it has g aine d considera ble a ttention and ac ceptanc e in
recent dec ades ( Wyatt & Midkiff, 2006). E videnc e from man y sourc es indic ates tha t mos t psychologic al

genetic factors . The graph in Figure 15.8 showsherita bility estima tes f or schiz ophrenia.
FIGURE 15.8 A person ’s risk o f developing schiz ophr enia incr eases if a r elativ e has schiz ophr enia . The closer the
genetic r elationship , the higher the risk.
Findings such as these ha ve led man y of today’s rese archers to se arch f or sp ecific g enes and g enetic muta tions
that contribute to mental disorders . Also, sophis ticated neural ima ging technolog y in rec ent dec ades has
revealed ho w abnormalities in brain s tructure and function might b e directly in volved in man y disorders , and
advances in our unders tanding o f neurotransmit ters and hormones ha ve yielde d insights into their p ossible
connections . The biologic al persp ectiv e is currently thriving in the s tudy o f psychologic al disorders .
The Diathesis-Str ess Model of Psychological Disor ders
Despite adv ances in unders tanding the biologic al basis o f psychologic al disorders , the ps ychoso cial
persp ectiv e is s till v ery imp ortant . This p ersp ectiv e emphasiz es the imp ortanc e of learning , stres s, faulty and
self-def eating thinking p atterns , and en vironmental factors . Perhaps the b est way to think a bout ps ychologic al
disorders , then , is to view them as origina ting from a c ombina tion o f biologic al and ps ychologic al pro cesses.
Man y dev elop not from a single c ause, but from a delic ate fusion b etween p artly biologic al and p artly
psychoso cial factors .
The diathesis -stres s mo del (Zuckerman , 1999) integra tes biologic al and ps ychoso cial factors to pre dict the
likeliho od of a disorder . This dia thesis -stres s mo del sugg ests tha t people with an underlying pre disp osition f or15.3 • P erspectiv es on P sychological Disor ders 547
a disorder (i .e., a dia thesis) are more lik ely than others to dev elop a disorder when fac ed with adv erse
environmental or ps ychologic al ev ents (i .e., stres s), such as childho od maltre atment , neg ative life ev ents ,
trauma, and so on . A dia thesis is not alw ays a biologic al vulnera bility to an illnes s; some dia theses ma y be
psychologic al (e .g., a tendency to think a bout lif e ev ents in a p essimis tic, self -def eating w ay).
The k ey as sumption o f the dia thesis -stres s mo del is tha t both factors , dia thesis and s tres s, are nec essary in the
development o f a disorder . Diff erent mo dels e xplore the rela tionship b etween the tw o factors: the lev el of

15.4 Anxiety Disor ders
LEARNING OBJEC TIVES
By the end o f this section, y ou wil l be able t o:
•Distinguish normal anxiety fr om pathological anxiety
•List and describe the major anxiety disor ders , including their main f eatur es and pr evalenc e
•Describe basic ps ychological and biological fact ors that ar e suspect ed to be impor tant in the etiolog y of anxiety
disor der
Everybody e xperienc es anxiety from time to time . Although anxiety is closely rela ted to f ear, the tw o states
possess imp ortant diff erenc es. Fear in volves an ins tantaneous re action to an imminent thre at, where as
anxiety in volves apprehension , avoidanc e, and c autiousnes s reg arding a p otential thre at, dang er, or other
negative ev ent (C rask e, 1999). While anxiety is unple asant to mos t people , it is imp ortant to our he alth , safety,
and w ell-b eing . Anxiety motiv ates us to tak e actions —such as prep aring f or e xams , watching our w eight ,
showing up to w ork on time —tha t ena ble us to a vert potential future problems . Anxiety also motiv ates us to
avoid c ertain things —such as r unning up debts and eng aging in illeg al activities —tha t could le ad to future
trouble . Mos t individuals’ lev el and dura tion o f anxiety appro xima tes the ma gnitude o f the p otential thre at
they fac e. For e xample , supp ose a s tudent who c ame to the U .S. as a “Dre amer ” (someone whose p arents didn ’t
lawfully immigra te) is c oncerne d about the p ossibility o f being una ble to c ontinue in the univ ersity program or
of losing ac cess to ac ademic financial aid , due to chang es and litig ation around the Def erre d Action f or
Childho od Arriv als (D ACA) program . This p erson lik ely w ould e xperienc e anxiety o f gre ater intensity and
dura tion than w ould a 21- year-old junior who entere d colleg e as a bir thright citiz en. Some p eople e xperienc e
anxiety tha t is e xcessive, persis tent , and gre atly out o f prop ortion to the actual thre at; if one ’s anxiety has a
disr uptiv e influenc e on one ’s life, this is a s trong indic ator tha t the individual is e xperiencing an anxiety
disorder .
Anxiet y disorders are characteriz ed by excessive and p ersis tent f ear and anxiety , and b y rela ted dis turb ances
in b ehavior (AP A, 2013). A lthough anxiety is univ ersally e xperienc ed, anxiety disorders c ause c onsidera ble
distres s. As a group , anxiety disorders are c ommon: appro xima tely 25%–30% o f the U .S. p opula tion meets the
criteria f or a t least one anxiety disorder during their lif etime (K essler et al ., 2005). A lso, these disorders app ear
to b e much more c ommon in w omen than the y are in men; within a 12-month p erio d, around 23% o f women
and 14% o f men will e xperienc e at least one anxiety disorder (N ational C omorbidity Sur vey, 2007). Anxiety
disorders are the mos t fre quently o ccurring clas s of mental disorders and are o ften c omorbid with e ach other
and with other mental disorders (K essler, Ruscio , She ar, & W ittchen , 2009).
Specific Phobia
Phobia is a Greek w ord tha t me ans f ear. A p erson dia gnose d with a specific phobia (formerly kno wn as simple
phobia ) experienc es e xcessive, dis tres sing , and p ersis tent f ear or anxiety a bout a sp ecific object or situa tion
(such as animals , enclose d sp aces, elev ators , or flying ) (AP A, 2013). E ven though p eople re alize their lev el of
fear and anxiety in rela tion to the phobic s timulus is irra tional , some p eople with a sp ecific phobia ma y go to
great lengths to a void the phobic s timulus (the object or situa tion tha t trigg ers the f ear and anxiety ). Typic ally,
the f ear and anxiety a phobic s timulus elicits is disr uptiv e to the p erson ’s life. For e xample , a man with a
phobia o f flying might refuse to ac cept a job tha t requires fre quent air tra vel, thus neg atively a ffecting his548 15 • P sychological Disor ders

Specific phobias are c ommon; in the Unite d Sta tes, around 12.5% o f the p opula tion will meet the criteria f or a
specific phobia a t some p oint in their lif etime (K essler et al ., 2005). One typ e of phobia, agoraphobia , is lis ted
in the DSM-5 as a sep arate anxiety disorder . Agoraphobia, which literally me ans “f ear o f the mark etplac e,” is
characteriz ed by intense f ear, anxiety , and a voidanc e of situa tions in which it might b e difficult to esc ape or
receive help if one e xperienc es symptoms o f a p anic a ttack (a s tate of extreme anxiety tha t we will discus s
shor tly). These situa tions include public transp ortation , open sp aces (p arking lots), enclose d sp aces (s tores),
crowds, or b eing outside the home alone (AP A, 2013). Ab out 1.4% o f Americ ans e xperienc e agoraphobia
during their lif etime (K essler et al ., 2005).
Acquisition of Phobias Thr ough Learning
Man y theories sugg est tha t phobias dev elop through le arning . Rachman (1977) prop osed tha t phobias c an b e
acquire d through three major le arning p athways. The firs t pathway is through clas sical conditioning . As y ou
may rec all, clas sical conditioning is a f orm o f learning in which a previously neutral s timulus is p aire d with an
unc onditione d stimulus (UCS ) tha t refle xively elicits an unc onditione d resp onse (UCR), eliciting the same
resp onse through its as sociation with the unc onditione d stimulus . The resp onse is c alled a c onditione d
resp onse (CR). F or e xample , a child who has b een bit ten b y a dog ma y come to f ear dogs b ecause o f a p ast
association with p ain. In this c ase, the dog bite is the UCS and the f ear it elicits is the UCR . Bec ause a dog w as
associated with the bite , any dog ma y come to ser ve as a c onditione d stimulus , thereb y eliciting f ear; the f ear
the child e xperienc es around dogs , then , becomes a CR .
The sec ond p athway of phobia ac quisition is through vic arious le arning , such as modeling . For e xample , a
child who obser ves their c ousin re act f earfully to spiders ma y later e xpres s the same f ears, even though
spiders ha ve nev er presente d an y dang er to them . This phenomenon has b een obser ved in b oth humans and
nonhuman prima tes (Ols son & Phelps , 2007). A s tudy o f laboratory-reared monk eys readily ac quire d a f ear o f15.4 • Anxiety Disor ders 549
snak es a fter obser ving wild-re ared monk eys react f earfully to snak es (Mineka & C ook, 1993).
The third p athway is through v erbal transmis sion or inf orma tion . For e xample , a child whose p arents , siblings ,
friends , and clas sma tes c onstantly tell them ho w dis gusting and dang erous snak es are ma y come to ac quire a
fear o f snak es.
Interes tingly , people are more lik ely to dev elop phobias o f things tha t do not represent much actual dang er to
themselv es, such as animals and heights , and are les s lik ely to dev elop phobias to ward things tha t present
legitima te dang er in c ontemp orar y so ciety , such as motorcy cles and w eapons (Öhman & Mineka, 2001). Wh y
might this b e so? One theor y sugg ests tha t the human brain is ev olutionarily pre disp osed to more re adily
associate certain objects or situa tions with f ear (Seligman , 1971). This theor y argues tha t throughout our
evolutionar y his tory, our anc estors as sociated certain s timuli (e .g., snak es, spiders , heights , and thunder) with
potential dang er. As time progres sed, the mind has b ecome adapte d to more re adily dev elop f ears o f these
things than o f others . Exp erimental evidenc e has c onsis tently demons trated tha t conditione d fears dev elop
more re adily to f ear-relev ant s timuli (ima ges o f snak es and spiders) than to f ear-irrelev ant s timuli (ima ges o f
flowers and b erries) (Öhman & Mineka, 2001). Such prep ared learning has also b een sho wn to o ccur in
monk eys. In one s tudy (C ook & Mineka, 1989), monk eys watche d videotap es o f mo del monk eys reacting
fearfully to either f ear-relev ant s timuli (to y snak es or a to y cro codile) or f ear-irrelev ant s timuli (flo wers or a to y
rabbit). The obser ver monk eys dev elop ed fears o f the f ear-relev ant s timuli but not the f ear-irrelev ant s timuli .
Social Anxiety Disor der
Social anxiet y disorder (formerly c alled so cial phobia) is characteriz ed by extreme and p ersis tent f ear or
anxiety and a voidanc e of social situa tions in which the p erson c ould p otentially b e ev alua ted neg atively b y
others (AP A, 2013). As with sp ecific phobias , social anxiety disorder is c ommon in the Unite d Sta tes; a lit tle
over 12% o f all Americ ans e xperienc e so cial anxiety disorder during their lif etime (K essler et al ., 2005).
The he art of the f ear and anxiety in so cial anxiety disorder is the p erson ’s concern tha t the y ma y act in a
humilia ting or emb arras sing w ay, such as app earing f oolish , sho wing s ymptoms o f anxiety ( blushing ), or doing
or sa ying something tha t might le ad to rejection (such as o ffending others). The kinds o f social situa tions in
which individuals with so cial anxiety disorder usually ha ve problems include public sp eaking , having a
conversa tion , meeting s trang ers, eating in res taurants , and , in some c ases , using public res trooms . Although
man y people b ecome anxious in so cial situa tions lik e public sp eaking , the f ear, anxiety , and a voidanc e
experienc ed in so cial anxiety disorder are highly dis tres sing and le ad to serious imp airments in lif e. Adults
with this disorder are more lik ely to e xperienc e lower e duc ational a ttainment and lo wer e arnings (K atzelnick
et al ., 2001), p erform more p oorly a t work and are more lik ely to b e unemplo yed (Moitra, Be ard, Weisb erg, &
Keller , 2011), and rep ort gre ater dis satisfaction with their family liv es, friends , leisure activities , and inc ome
(Stein & K ean, 2000).
When p eople with so cial anxiety disorder are una ble to a void situa tions tha t pro voke anxiety , the y typic ally
perform safety beha viors : mental or b ehavioral acts tha t reduce anxiety in so cial situa tions b y re ducing the
chanc e of neg ative so cial outc omes . Safety b ehaviors include a voiding e ye contact , rehe arsing sentenc es
before sp eaking , talking only briefly , and not talking a bout oneself (A lden & Bieling , 1998). Other e xamples o f
safety b ehaviors include the f ollowing (Mark er, 2013):
•assuming roles in so cial situa tions tha t minimiz e interaction with others (e .g., taking pictures , set ting up
equipment , or helping prep are f ood)
•asking p eople man y ques tions to k eep the f ocus o ff of oneself
•selecting a p osition to a void scr utin y or c ontact with others (sit ting in the b ack o f the ro om)
•wearing bland , neutral clothes to a void dra wing a ttention to oneself
•avoiding subs tanc es or activities tha t might c ause anxiety s ymptoms (such as c affeine , warm clothing , and
physical exercise)
Although these b ehaviors are intende d to prev ent the p erson with so cial anxiety disorder from doing550 15 • P sychological Disor ders
Access for fr ee a t opens tax. org
something a wkw ard tha t might dra w criticism , these actions usually e xacerbate the problem b ecause the y do
not allo w the individual to disc onfirm their neg ative beliefs , often eliciting rejection and other neg ative
reactions from others (A lden & Bieling , 1998).
People with so cial anxiety disorder ma y resor t to self -me dication , such as drinking alc ohol , as a me ans to a vert
the anxiety s ymptoms the y experienc e in so cial situa tions (Ba ttista & K ocovski , 2010). The use o f alc ohol when
faced with such situa tions ma y become neg atively reinf orcing: enc oura ging individuals with so cial anxiety
disorder to turn to the subs tanc e whenev er the y experienc e anxiety s ymptoms . The tendency to use alc ohol as
a coping mechanism f or so cial anxiety , however, can c ome with a hefty pric e tag: a numb er o f larg e sc ale
studies ha ve rep orted a high ra te of comorbidity b etween so cial anxiety disorder and alc ohol use disorder
(Morris , Stew art, & Ham , 2005).
As with sp ecific phobias , it is highly prob able tha t the f ears inherent to so cial anxiety disorder c an dev elop
through c onditioning e xperienc es. For e xample , a child who is subjecte d to e arly unple asant so cial
experienc es (e .g., bullying a t scho ol) ma y dev elop neg ative so cial ima ges o f herself tha t become activ ated later
in anxiety -pro voking situa tions (Hackmann , Clark , & McManus , 2000). Indee d, one s tudy rep orted tha t 92% o f
a sample o f adults with so cial anxiety disorder rep orted a his tory of sev ere te asing in childho od, comp ared to
only 35% o f a sample o f adults with p anic disorder (McC abe, Anton y, Summer feldt , Lis s, & Swinson , 2003).
One o f the mos t well-es tablishe d risk factors f or dev eloping so cial anxiety disorder is b ehavioral inhibition
(Cla uss & Blackf ord, 2012). Beha vioral inhibition is thought to b e an inherite d trait , and it is characteriz ed by a
consis tent tendency to sho w fear and res traint when presente d with unfamiliar p eople or situa tions (K agan,
Reznick , & Snidman , 1988). Beha vioral inhibition is displa yed very early in lif e; behaviorally inhibite d to ddlers
and children resp ond with gre at caution and res traint in unfamiliar situa tions , and the y are o ften timid ,
fearful, and sh y around unfamiliar p eople (F ox, Henderson , Marshall , Nichols , & Ghera, 2005). A rec ent
statistical review o f studies demons trated tha t behavioral inhibition w as as sociated with more than a sev enfold
incre ase in the risk o f dev elopment o f social anxiety disorder , demons trating tha t behavioral inhibition is a
major risk factor f or the disorder (Cla uss & Blackf ord, 2012).
Panic Disor der
Ima gine tha t you are a t the mall one da y with y our friends and—suddenly and ine xplic ably—you b egin s weating

worry for a month or more tha t similar episo des will o ccur in the future , it is lik ely tha t you ha ve dev elop ed
panic disorder .15.4 • Anxiety Disor ders 551

sweating , trembling , feelings o f faintnes s, or a f ear o f losing c ontr ol, among other s ymp toms .
People with panic disorder experienc e recurrent (more than one) and une xpecte d panic a ttacks , along with a t
least one month o f persis tent c oncern a bout additional p anic a ttacks , worry over the c onse quenc es o f the
attacks , or self -def eating chang es in b ehavior rela ted to the a ttacks (e .g., avoidanc e of exercise or unfamiliar
situa tions) (AP A, 2013). As is the c ase with other anxiety disorders , the p anic a ttacks c annot result from the
physiologic al eff ects o f drugs and other subs tanc es, a me dical condition , or another mental disorder . Apanic
attack is define d as a p erio d of extreme f ear or disc omf ort tha t dev elops a bruptly and re aches a p eak within 10
minutes . Its s ymptoms include ac celera ted he art rate, sweating , trembling , choking sensa tions , hot flashes or
chills , dizzines s or lighthe adednes s, fears o f losing c ontrol or g oing crazy , and f ears o f dying (AP A, 2013).
Sometimes p anic a ttacks are e xpecte d, occurring in resp onse to sp ecific en vironmental trigg ers (such as b eing
in a tunnel); other times , these episo des are une xpecte d and emerg e randomly (such as when relaxing ).
According to the DSM-5, the p erson mus t experienc e une xpecte d panic a ttacks to qualif y for a dia gnosis o f
panic disorder .
Exp eriencing a p anic a ttack is o ften terrif ying . Rather than rec ognizing the s ymptoms o f a p anic a ttack merely
as signs o f intense anxiety , individuals with p anic disorder o ften misinterpret them as a sign tha t something is
intensely wrong internally (thinking , for e xample , tha t the p ounding he art represents an imp ending he art
attack). P anic a ttacks c an o ccasionally precipita te trips to the emerg ency ro om b ecause sev eral s ymptoms o f
panic a ttacks are , in fact , similar to those as sociated with he art problems (e .g., palpita tions , racing pulse , and a
pounding sensa tion in the ches t) (R oot, 2000). Unsurprisingly , those with p anic disorder f ear future a ttacks
and ma y become preo ccupie d with mo difying their b ehavior in an eff ort to a void future p anic a ttacks . For this
reason , panic disorder is o ften characteriz ed as f ear o f fear (Golds tein & Chambles s, 1978).
Panic a ttacks themselv es are not mental disorders . Indee d, around 23% o f Americ ans e xperienc e isola ted
panic a ttacks in their liv es without meeting the criteria f or p anic disorder (K essler et al ., 2006), indic ating tha t
panic a ttacks are fairly c ommon . Panic disorder is , of course , much les s common , afflicting 4.7% o f Americ ans
during their lif etime (K essler et al ., 2005). Man y people with p anic disorder dev elop a goraphobia, which is
mark ed by fear and a voidanc e of situa tions in which esc ape might b e difficult or help might not b e available if
one w ere to dev elop s ymptoms o f a p anic a ttack . People with p anic disorder o ften e xperienc e a c omorbid
disorder , such as other anxiety disorders or major depres sive disorder (AP A, 2013).

disorder if their p arents ha ve the disorder (Bie derman et al ., 2001), and family and twins s tudies indic ate tha t
the herita bility o f panic disorder is around 43% (Het tema, N eale, & K endler , 2001). The e xact g enes and g ene
functions in volved in this disorder , however, are not w ell-unders tood (AP A, 2013). N eurobiologic al theories o f
panic disorder sugg est tha t a region o f the brain c alled the locus c oeruleus may pla y a role in this disorder .
Located in the brains tem , the lo cus c oeruleus is the brain ’s major sourc e of norepinephrine , a
neurotransmit ter tha t trigg ers the b ody’s fight -or-flight resp onse . Activation o f the lo cus c oeruleus is
associated with anxiety and f ear, and rese arch with nonhuman prima tes has sho wn tha t stimula ting the lo cus
coeruleus either electric ally or through dr ugs pro duces p anic -like symptoms (Charne y et al ., 1990). Such
findings ha ve led to the theor y tha t panic disorder ma y be caused by abnormal norepinephrine activity in the
locus c oeruleus (Bremner , Krystal, South wick , & Charne y, 1996).
Conditioning theories o f panic disorder prop ose tha t panic a ttacks are clas sical conditioning resp onses to
subtle b odily sensa tions resembling those normally o ccurring when one is anxious or frightene d (Bouton ,
Mineka, & Barlo w, 2001). F or e xample , consider a child who has as thma. An acute as thma a ttack pro duces
sensa tions , such as shor tnes s of bre ath, coughing , and ches t tightnes s, tha t typic ally elicit f ear and anxiety .
Later, when the child e xperienc es subtle s ymptoms tha t resemble the frightening s ymptoms o f earlier as thma
attacks (such as shor tnes s of bre ath a fter climbing s tairs), the y ma y become anxious , fearful, and then
experienc e a p anic a ttack . In this situa tion , the subtle s ymptoms w ould represent a c onditione d stimulus , and
the p anic a ttack w ould b e a c onditione d resp onse . The finding tha t panic disorder is ne arly three times as
frequent among p eople with as thma as it is among p eople without as thma ( Weiser , 2007) supp orts the
possibility tha t panic disorder has the p otential to dev elop through clas sical conditioning .
Cognitiv e factors ma y pla y an integral p art in p anic disorder . Generally , cognitiv e theories (Clark , 1996) argue
that those with p anic disorder are prone to interpret ordinar y bodily sensa tions c atastrophic ally, and these
fearful interpreta tions set the s tage for p anic a ttacks . For e xample , a p erson might detect b odily chang es tha t
are routinely trigg ered by inno cuous ev ents such as g etting up from a se ated position (dizzines s), e xercising
(incre ased he art rate, shor tnes s of bre ath), or drinking a larg e cup o f coffee (incre ased he art rate, trembling ).
The individual interprets these subtle b odily chang es c atastrophic ally (“Ma ybe I’m ha ving a he art attack!”).
Such interpreta tions cre ate fear and anxiety , which trigg er additional ph ysical symptoms; subse quently , the
person e xperienc es a p anic a ttack . Supp ort of this c ontention res ts with findings tha t people with more sev ere
catastrophic thoughts a bout sensa tions ha ve more fre quent and sev ere p anic a ttacks , and among those with
panic disorder , reducing c atastrophic c ognitions a bout their sensa tions is as eff ectiv e as me dication in
reducing p anic a ttacks (Go od & Hinton , 2009).

About 5.7% o f the U .S. p opula tion will dev elop s ymptoms o f generaliz ed anxiety disorder during their lif etime

Generaliz ed anxiety disorder is highly c omorbid with mo od disorders and other anxiety disorders (N oyes,

LEARNING OBJEC TIVES
By the end o f this section, y ou wil l be able t o:
•Describe the main f eatur es and pr evalenc e of obses sive-compulsiv e disor der, body dy smorphic disor der, and
hoar ding disor der
•Unders tand some o f the fact ors in the de velopment o f obses sive-compulsiv e disor der
Obses sive-compulsiv e and relate d disorders are a group o f overlapping disorders tha t generally in volve
intr usiv e, unple asant thoughts and rep etitiv e behaviors . Man y of us e xperienc e un wante d thoughts from time
to time (e .g., cra ving double cheeseburg ers when dieting ), and man y of us eng age in rep etitiv e behaviors on
occasion (e .g., pacing when ner vous). Ho wever, obses sive-compulsiv e and rela ted disorders elev ate the
unwante d thoughts and rep etitiv e behaviors to a s tatus so intense tha t these c ognitions and activities disr upt
daily lif e. Include d in this c ategory are obses sive-compulsiv e disorder (O CD), b ody dy smorphic disorder , and
hoarding disorder .
Obsessive-Compulsive Disor der
People with obses sive-compulsiv e disorder (OCD) experienc e thoughts and urg es tha t are intr usiv e and
unwante d (obses sions) and/or the nee d to eng age in rep etitiv e behaviors or mental acts (c ompulsions). A
person with this disorder might , for e xample , spend hours e ach da y washing his hands or c onstantly checking
and rechecking to mak e sure tha t a s tove, faucet, or light has b een turne d off.
Obses sions are more than jus t un wante d thoughts tha t seem to randomly jump into our he ad from time to
time , such as rec alling an insensitiv e remark a c oworker made rec ently , and the y are more signific ant than554 15 • P sychological Disor ders

day-to-day worries w e might ha ve, such as jus tifia ble c oncerns a bout b eing laid o ff from a job . Rather ,
obses sions are characteriz ed as p ersis tent , unintentional , and un wante d thoughts and urg es tha t are highly
intr usiv e, unple asant , and dis tres sing (AP A, 2013). C ommon obses sions include c oncerns a bout g erms and
contamina tion , doubts (“Did I turn the w ater o ff?”), order and s ymmetr y (“I nee d all the sp oons in the tra y to b e
arrang ed a c ertain w ay”), and urg es tha t are a ggres sive or lus tful. Usually , the p erson kno ws tha t such thoughts
and urg es are irra tional and thus tries to suppres s or ignore them , but has an e xtremely difficult time doing so .
These obses sive symptoms sometimes o verlap , such tha t someone might ha ve both c ontamina tion and
aggres sive obses sions (Abramo witz & Siqueland , 2013).
Compulsions are rep etitiv e and ritualis tic acts tha t are typic ally c arrie d out primarily as a me ans to minimiz e
the dis tres s tha t obses sions trigg er or to re duce the lik eliho od of a feared ev ent (AP A, 2013). Compulsions
often include such b ehaviors as rep eated and e xtensiv e hand w ashing , cle aning , checking (e .g., tha t a do or is
locked), and ordering (e .g., lining up all the p encils in a p articular w ay), and the y also include such mental acts

Body Dysmorphic Disor der
An individual with body dy smorphic disorder is preo ccupie d with a p erceived fla w in ph ysical app earanc e
that is either none xistent or b arely notic eable to other p eople (AP A, 2013). These p erceived ph ysical def ects
cause p eople to think the y are una ttractiv e, ugly , hideous , or def orme d. These preo ccup ations c an f ocus on an y
bodily are a, but the y typic ally in volve the skin , fac e, or hair . The preo ccup ation with ima gine d ph ysical fla ws
driv es the p erson to eng age in rep etitiv e and ritualis tic b ehavioral and mental acts , such as c onstantly lo oking
in the mirror , trying to hide the o ffending b ody p art, comp arisons with others , and , in some e xtreme c ases ,
cosmetic surg ery (Phillips , 2005). An es tima ted 2.4% o f the adults in the Unite d Sta tes meet the criteria f or
body dy smorphic disorder , with slightly higher ra tes in w omen than in men (AP A, 2013).
Hoar ding Disor der
Although ho arding w as traditionally c onsidere d to b e a s ymptom o f OCD, considera ble evidenc e sugg ests tha t
hoarding represents an entirely diff erent disorder (Ma taix -Cols et al ., 2010). P eople with hoarding disorder
cannot b ear to p art with p ersonal p ossessions , reg ardles s of ho w valueles s or useles s these p ossessions are . As
a result , these individuals ac cumula te excessive amounts o f usually w orthles s items tha t clut ter their living
areas (Figure 15.12 ). Often , the quantity o f clut tere d items is so e xcessive tha t the p erson is una ble to use his
kitchen , or sleep in his b ed. People who suff er from this disorder ha ve gre at difficulty p arting with items
because the y believ e the items might b e of some la ter use , or b ecause the y form a sentimental a ttachment to15.5 • Obses sive-Compulsiv e and R elated Disor ders 555
the items (AP A, 2013). Imp ortantly , a dia gnosis o f ho arding disorder is made only if the ho arding is not c aused
by another me dical condition and if the ho arding is not a s ymptom o f another disorder (e .g., schiz ophrenia)
(APA, 2013).

Causes of OCD
The results o f family and twin s tudies sugg est tha t OCD has a mo dera te genetic c omp onent . The disorder is
five times more fre quent in the firs t-degree rela tives o f people with O CD than in p eople without the disorder
(Nestadt et al ., 2000). A dditionally , the c oncordanc e ra te of OCD among identic al twins is around 57%;
however, the c oncordanc e ra te for fra ternal twins is 22% (Bolton , Rijsdijk , O’Connor , Perrin , & Ele y, 2007).
Studies ha ve implic ated about tw o do zen p otential g enes tha t ma y be involved in O CD; these g enes regula te the
function o f three neurotransmit ters: serotonin , dop amine , and glutama te (P auls, 2010). Man y of these s tudies
include d small sample siz es and ha ve yet to b e replic ated. Thus , additional rese arch nee ds to b e done in this
area.
A brain region tha t is b eliev ed to pla y a critic al role in O CD is the orbitofrontal c ortex(Kopell & Greenb erg,
2008), an are a of the frontal lob e involved in le arning and decision-making (R ushworth, Noonan , Bo orman ,
Walton , & Behrens , 2011) ( Figure 15.13 ). In p eople with O CD, the orbito frontal c ortex becomes esp ecially
hyperactiv e when the y are pro voked with tasks in which , for e xample , the y are ask ed to lo ok a t a photo o f a
toilet or o f pictures hanging cro okedly on a w all (Simon , Kaufmann , Müsch , Kischk el, & K athmann , 2010). The
orbito frontal c ortex is p art of a series o f brain regions tha t, collectiv ely, is c alled the O CD circuit; this circuit
consis ts of sev eral interc onnecte d regions tha t influenc e the p erceived emotional v alue o f stimuli and the
selection o f both b ehavioral and c ognitiv e resp onses (Gra ybiel & Ra uch , 2000). As with the orbito frontal c ortex,
other regions o f the O CD circuit sho w heightene d activity during s ymptom pro vocation (R otge et al ., 2008),
which sugg ests tha t abnormalities in these regions ma y pro duce the s ymptoms o f OCD (Sax ena, Bota, & Bro dy,
2001). C onsis tent with this e xplana tion , people with O CD sho w a subs tantially higher degree o f connectivity o f
the orbito frontal c ortex and other regions o f the O CD circuit than do those without O CD (Beuck e et al ., 2013).556 15 • P sychological Disor ders

The findings discus sed above were b ased on ima ging s tudies , and the y highlight the p otential imp ortanc e of
brain dy sfunction in O CD. Ho wever, one imp ortant limita tion o f these findings is the ina bility to e xplain
differenc es in obses sions and c ompulsions . Another limita tion is tha t the c orrela tional rela tionship b etween
neurologic al abnormalities and O CD s ymptoms c annot imply c ausation (Abramo witz & Siqueland , 2013).
Conditioning and OCD
The s ymp toms o f OCD ha ve been theoriz ed to be learned r esponses , acquired and sus tained as the r esul t of a
combination o f two forms o f learning: clas sical c onditioning and oper ant c onditioning (Mowrer, 1960; St einmetz ,
Tracy, & Gr een, 2001). Specifical ly, the ac quisition o f OCD ma y oc cur firs t as the r esul t of clas sical c onditioning ,
wher eby a neutr al stimulus bec omes as sociat ed with an unc onditioned s timulus that pr ovokes anxiety or dis tress.
When an individual has ac quired this as sociation, subsequent enc ount ers with the neutr al stimulus trig ger anxiety ,
including obses sive thoughts; the anxiety and obses sive thoughts (which ar e no w a c onditioned r esponse) ma y
persis t until the y identif y some s trategy to relieve it. R elief ma y tak e the f orm o f a ritualis tic beha vior or mental
activity that, when enact ed repeat edly, reduc es the anxiety . Such eff orts to relieve anxiety c onstitut e an e xample o f
negative reinforcement (a f orm o f oper ant c onditioning ). Recal l from the chap ter on learning that neg ative
reinforcement in volves the s trengthening o f beha vior thr ough its ability t o remo ve something unpleasant or a versiv e.
Henc e, compulsiv e acts obser ved in OCD ma y be sus tained because the y are neg atively reinforcing , in the sense
that the y reduc e anxiety trig gered b y a c onditioned s timulus .
Suppose an individual with OCD e xperienc es obses sive thoughts about g erms , contamination, and disease
whene ver the y enc ount er a doorknob . What might ha ve constitut ed a viable unc onditioned s timulus? Also , what
would c onstitut e the c onditioned s timulus , unc onditioned r esponse , and c onditioned r esponse? What kinds o f
compulsiv e beha viors might w e expect, and ho w do the y reinforce themsel ves? What is decr eased? Additional ly,
and fr om the s tandpoint o f learning theor y, how might the s ymp toms o f OCD be tr eated suc cessfully?

stres s disorder was dev elop ed giv en tha t these s ymptoms c ould happ en to an yone who e xperienc ed
psychologic al tra uma.
A Br oader Definition of P TSD
PTSD w as lis ted among the anxiety disorders in previous DSM e ditions . In DSM-5, it is no w lis ted among a
group c alled Trauma-and-Stres sor-Related Disorders . For a p erson to b e dia gnose d with PT SD, the y mus t be
exposed to, witnes s, or e xperienc e the details o f a tra uma tic e xperienc e (e.g., a firs t resp onder), one tha t
involves “actual or thre atene d de ath, serious injur y, or se xual violenc e” (AP A, 2013, p . 271). These e xperienc es
can include such ev ents as c omb at, thre atene d or actual ph ysical attack , sexual as sault, natural disas ters ,
terroris t attacks , and a utomobile ac cidents . This criterion mak es PT SD the only disorder lis ted in the DSM in
which a c ause (e xtreme tra uma) is e xplicitly sp ecifie d.
Symptoms o f PT SD include intr usiv e and dis tres sing memories o f the ev ent,flashb acks(states tha t can las t
from a f ew sec onds to sev eral da ys, during which the individual reliv es the ev ent and b ehaves as if the ev ent
were o ccurring a t tha t moment [AP A, 2013]), a voidanc e of stimuli c onnecte d to the ev ent, persis tently neg ative
emotional s tates (e .g., fear, ang er, guilt , and shame), f eelings o f detachment from others , irrita bility , pronenes s
toward outburs ts, and an e xaggerated startle resp onse ( jumpines s). F or PT SD to b e dia gnose d, these
symptoms mus t occur f or a t least one month .
Roughly 7% o f adults in the Unite d Sta tes, including 9.7% o f women and 3.6% o f men , experienc e PT SD in
their lif etime (N ational C omorbidity Sur vey, 2007), with higher ra tes among p eople e xposed to mas s tra uma
and p eople whose jobs in volve duty -rela ted tra uma e xposure (e .g., police officers, firefighters , and emerg ency
medical personnel) (AP A, 2013). N early 21% o f residents o f are as a ffecte d by Hurric ane K atrina suff ered from
PTSD one y ear following the hurric ane (K essler et al ., 2008), and 12.6% o f Manha ttan residents w ere obser ved
as ha ving PT SD 2–3 y ears a fter the 9/11 terroris t attacks (DiGrande et al ., 2008).
Risk F actors F or P TSD
Of c ourse , not ev eryone who e xperienc es a tra uma tic ev ent will g o on to dev elop PT SD; sev eral factors s trongly
predict the dev elopment o f PT SD: tra uma e xperienc e, gre ater tra uma sev erity , lack o f imme diate so cial
supp ort, and more subse quent lif e stres s (Brewin , Andrew s, & V alentine , 2000). T rauma tic ev ents tha t involve
harm b y others (e .g., comb at, rap e, and se xual moles tation) c arry gre ater risk than do other tra umas (e .g.,
natural disas ters) (K essler, Sonneg a, Bromet , Hughes , & N elson , 1995). W omen are more lik ely to ha ve been
trauma tized because o f sexual tra uma, childho od neglect , and childho od ph ysical abuse . Men are more lik ely
to ha ve been tra uma tized by na tural disas ter, life-thre atening ac cident , and ph ysical violenc e, either witnes sed
or directe d at them . Adolesc ent b oys are more lik ely to e xperienc e ac cident , physical as sault, and witnes s
death/injur y; adolesc ent girls are more lik ely to e xperienc e rap e/se xual as sault, intima te p artner violenc e, or
une xpecte d de ath or injur y of a lo ved one . Assaultiv e violenc e and witnes sing tra uma to others is more

to b e exposed to and victims o f violenc e than males o f other rac es (Kilp atrick , Badour , & R esnick , 2017). A
2012 s tudy f ound tha t 27% o f corrections o fficers rep orted experiencing s ymptoms o f PT SD in the p ast 30
days. Rates w ere higher f or males (31%) than f emales (22%) (S pinaris , Denho f, & K ellaway, 2012). A s tudy
conducte d by Jaegers et al (2019) f ound tha t 53.4% o f jail c orrectional o fficers screene d positiv ely f or PT SD.
PTSD is more prev alent in prison p opula tions than in the g eneral public , with prev alenc e es tima tes o f 6% in
male prisoners and 21% in f emale prisoners (F acer-Irwin et al , 2019). F actors tha t incre ase the risk o f PT SD
include f emale g ender , low so cioeconomic s tatus, low intellig ence, personal his tory of mental disorders ,
history of childho od adv ersity (a buse or other tra uma during childho od), and family his tory of mental
disorders (Brewin et al ., 2000). P ersonality characteris tics such as neuroticism and soma tization (the tendency
to experienc e ph ysical symptoms when one enc ounters s tres s) ha ve been sho wn to elev ate the risk o f PT SD
(Bramsen , Dirkzw ager, & v an der Plo eg, 2000). P eople who e xperienc e childho od adv ersity and/or tra uma tic
experienc es during adultho od are a t signific antly higher risk o f dev eloping PT SD if the y possess one or tw o
shor t versions o f a g ene tha t regula tes the neurotransmit ter serotonin ( Xie et al ., 2009). This sugg ests a
possible dia thesis -stres s interpreta tion o f PT SD: its dev elopment is influenc ed by the interaction o f
psychoso cial and biologic al factors .
Support F or Suff erers of P TSD
Research has sho wn tha t social supp ort following a tra uma tic ev ent c an re duce the lik eliho od of PT SD (Oz er,
Best, Lipse y, & W eiss, 2003). So cial supp ort is o ften define d as the c omf ort, advic e, and as sistanc e rec eived
from rela tives, friends , and neighb ors. Social supp ort can help individuals c ope during difficult times b y
allowing them to discus s feelings and e xperienc es and pro viding a sense o f being lo ved and apprecia ted. A
14-year study o f 1,377 p eople who had ser ved in the V ietnam W ar found tha t those who p erceived les s so cial
supp ort when the y came home w ere more lik ely to dev elop PT SD than w ere those who p erceived gre ater

Learning and the Development of P TSD
PTSD le arning mo dels sugg est tha t some s ymptoms are dev elop ed and maintaine d through clas sical
conditioning . The tra uma tic ev ent ma y act as an unc onditione d stimulus tha t elicits an unc onditione d
resp onse characteriz ed by extreme f ear and anxiety . Cognitiv e, emotional , physiologic al, and en vironmental
cues ac comp anying or rela ted to the ev ent are c onditione d stimuli . These tra uma tic reminders ev oke
conditione d resp onses (e xtreme f ear and anxiety ) similar to those c aused by the ev ent itself (N ader , 2001). A
person who witnes sed or e xperienc ed a plane crash and who dev elop ed PT SD ma y displa y excessive
hypervigilanc e and dis tres s when planes fly o verhe ad; this b ehavior c onstitutes a c onditione d resp onse to the
trauma tic reminder (c onditione d stimulus o f the sight and sound o f an airplane). Diff erenc es in ho w
conditiona ble individuals are help to e xplain diff erenc es in the dev elopment and maintenanc e of PT SD
symptoms (Pit tman , 1988). C onditioning s tudies demons trate facilita ted ac quisition o f conditione d resp onses
and dela yed extinction o f conditione d resp onses in p eople with PT SD (Orr et al ., 2000).
Cognitiv e factors are imp ortant in the dev elopment and maintenanc e of PT SD. One mo del sugg ests tha t two
key pro cesses are cr ucial: dis turb ances in memor y for the ev ent, and neg ative appraisals o f the tra uma and its
afterma th (Ehlers & Clark , 2000). A ccording to this theor y, some p eople who e xperienc e tra umas do not f orm
coherent memories o f the tra uma; memories o f the tra uma tic ev ent are p oorly enc oded and , thus , are
fragmente d, disorg aniz ed, and lacking in detail . Theref ore, these individuals are una ble rememb er the ev ent
in a w ay tha t giv es it me aning and c onte xt. A rap e victim who c annot c oherently rememb er the ev ent ma y
rememb er only bits and piec es (e .g., the a ttack er rep eating a w ord or insult); b ecause the victim w as una ble to
develop a fully integra ted memor y, the fra gmentar y memor y tends to s tand out . Although una ble to retriev e a
complete memor y of the ev ent, the victim ma y be ha unte d by intr usiv e fra gments in voluntarily trigg ered by
stimuli as sociated with the ev ent (e .g., memories o f the a ttack er’s comments when enc ountering a p erson who
resembles the a ttack er). This interpreta tion fits previously discus sed ma terial c oncerning PT SD and
conditioning . The mo del also prop oses tha t neg ative appraisals o f the ev ent (“I deser ved to b e rap ed because
I’m stupid ”) ma y lead to dy sfunctional b ehavioral s trategies (e .g., avoiding so cial activities where men are
likely to b e present) tha t maintain PT SD s ymptoms b y prev enting b oth a chang e in the na ture o f the memor y
and a chang e in the problema tic appraisals .

Major Depr essive Disor der
According to the DSM-5, the defining s ymptoms o fmajor depres sive disorder include “ depres sed mo od mos t
of the da y, nearly ev ery da y” (feeling sad , empty , hop eles s, or app earing te arful to others), and los s of interes t
and ple asure in usual activities (AP A, 2013). In addition to f eeling o verwhelmingly sad mos t of each da y,
people with depres sion will no long er sho w interes t or enjo yment in activities tha t previously w ere gra tifying ,
such as hobbies , sports, sex, social ev ents , time sp ent with family , and so on . Friends and family memb ers ma y

To rec eive a dia gnosis o f major depres sive disorder , one mus t experienc e a total o f five symptoms f or a t least a

Major depres sive disorder is c onsidere d episo dic: its s ymptoms are typic ally present a t their full ma gnitude
for a c ertain p erio d of time and then gradually a bate. Appro xima tely 50%–60% o f people who e xperienc e an

U.S. p opula tion e xperienc es major depres sive disorder e ach y ear; 16.9% will e xperienc e the disorder during
their lif etime (K essler & W ang , 2009). It is more c ommon among w omen than among men , affecting
appro xima tely 20% o f women and 13% o f men a t some p oint in their lif e (N ational C omorbidity Sur vey, 2007).
The gre ater risk among w omen is not ac counte d for b y a tendency to rep ort symptoms or to seek help more
readily , sugg esting tha t gender diff erenc es in the ra tes o f major depres sive disorder ma y reflect biologic al and
gender -rela ted en vironmental e xperienc es (K essler, 2003).
Lifetime ra tes o f major depres sive disorder tend to b e highes t in N orth and South Americ a, Europ e, and
Australia; the y are c onsidera bly lo wer in Asian c ountries (Hasin , Fenton , & W eissman , 2011). The ra tes o f
major depres sive disorder are higher among y oung er a ge cohor ts than among older c ohor ts, perhaps b ecause
people in y oung er a ge cohor ts are more willing to admit depres sion (K essler & W ang , 2009).
A numb er o f risk factors are as sociated with major depres sive disorder: unemplo yment (including
homemak ers); e arning les s than $20,000 p er year; living in urb an are as; or b eing sep arated, div orced, or562 15 • P sychological Disor ders

wido wed (Hasin et al ., 2011). C omorbid disorders include anxiety disorders and subs tanc e abuse disorders
(Kessler & W ang , 2009).
Subtypes of Depr ession
The DSM-5 lis ts sev eral diff erent subtyp es o f depres sion . These subtyp es—wha t the DSM-5 ref er to as
specifiers —are not sp ecific disorders; ra ther , the y are la bels use d to indic ate sp ecific p atterns o f symptoms or
to sp ecify certain p erio ds o f time in which the s ymptoms ma y be present . One subtyp e,seasonal p attern ,
applies to situa tions in which a p erson e xperienc es the s ymptoms o f major depres sive disorder only during a
particular time o f year (e .g., fall or winter). In ev eryday langua ge, people o ften ref er to this subtyp e as the
winter blues .
Another subtyp e,perip artum onset (commonly ref erre d to as postpartum depres sion ), applies to w omen who
experienc e major depres sion during pregnancy or in the f our w eeks f ollowing the bir th o f their child (AP A,
2013). These w omen o ften f eel v ery anxious and ma y ev en ha ve panic a ttacks . The y ma y feel guilty , agita ted,
and b e weepy. The y ma y not w ant to hold or c are f or their newb orn, even in c ases in which the pregnancy w as
desire d and intende d. In e xtreme c ases , the mother ma y ha ve feelings o f wanting to harm her child or herself.
In a horrific illus tration , a w oman name d Andre a Yates, who suff ered from e xtreme p erip artum-onset
depres sion (as w ell as other mental illnes ses), dro wne d her fiv e children in a b athtub (R oche, 2002). Mos t
women with p erip artum-onset depres sion do not ph ysically harm their children , but mos t do ha ve difficulty
being ade qua te caregiv ers (F ields , 2010). A surprisingly high numb er o f women e xperienc e symptoms o f
perip artum-onset depres sion . A s tudy o f 10,000 w omen who had rec ently giv en bir th found tha t 14% screene d
positiv e for p erip artum-onset depres sion , and tha t ne arly 20% rep orted ha ving thoughts o f wanting to harm
themselv es (Wisner et al ., 2013).
People with persis tent depres sive disorder (previously kno wn as dy sthymia) e xperienc e depres sed mo ods
mos t of the da y ne arly ev ery da y for a t least two years, as w ell as a t least two of the other s ymptoms o f major
depres sive disorder . People with p ersis tent depres sive disorder are chronic ally sad and melancholy , but do not
meet all the criteria f or major depres sion . Ho wever, episo des o f full-blo wn major depres sive disorder c an
occur during p ersis tent depres sive disorder (AP A, 2013).
Bipolar Disor der
A person with bipolar disorder (commonly kno wn as manic depres sion ) often e xperienc es mo od states tha t
vacilla te between depres sion and mania; tha t is, the p erson ’s mo od is said to alterna te from one emotional
extreme to the other (in c ontras t to unip olar , which indic ates a p ersis tently sad mo od).
To be dia gnose d with bip olar disorder , a p erson mus t ha ve experienc ed a manic episo de a t least onc e in their
life; although major depres sive episo des are c ommon in bip olar disorder , the y are not re quire d for a dia gnosis
(APA, 2013). A ccording to the DSM-5, a manic episo deis characteriz ed as a “ distinct p erio d of abnormally and
persis tently elev ated, expansiv e, or irrita ble mo od and a bnormally and p ersis tently incre ased activity or
energ y las ting a t least one w eek,” tha t las ts mos t of the time e ach da y (AP A, 2013, p . 124). During a manic
episo de, some e xperienc e a mo od tha t is almos t euphoric and b ecome e xcessively talka tive, sometimes
spontaneously s tarting c onversa tions with s trang ers; others b ecome e xcessively irrita ble and c omplain or
mak e hos tile c omments . The p erson ma y talk loudly and rapidly , exhibiting flight of ide as, abruptly s witching
from one topic to another . These individuals are e asily dis tracte d, which c an mak e a c onversa tion v ery
difficult . The y ma y exhibit grandiosity , in which the y experienc e infla ted but unjus tifie d self -esteem and self -
confidenc e. For e xample , the y might quit a job in order to “ strike it rich ” in the s tock mark et, despite lacking
the kno wledge, experienc e, and c apital f or such an ende avor. The y ma y tak e on sev eral tasks a t the same time
(e.g., sev eral time -consuming projects a t work) and y et sho w lit tle, if an y, nee d for sleep; some ma y go for da ys
without sleep . Patients ma y also reckles sly eng age in ple asura ble activities tha t could ha ve harmful
conse quenc es, including sp ending sprees , reckles s driving , making f oolish in vestments , excessive gambling ,
or eng aging in se xual enc ounters with s trang ers (AP A, 2013).15.7 • Mood and R elated Disor ders 563
During a manic episo de, individuals usually f eel as though the y are not ill and do not nee d tre atment . Ho wever,
the reckles s behaviors tha t often ac comp any these episo des—which c an b e antiso cial, illeg al, or ph ysically
thre atening to others —ma y re quire in voluntar y hospitaliza tion (AP A, 2013). Some p atients with bip olar
disorder will e xperienc e a rapid-cy cling subtyp e, which is characteriz ed by at least four manic episo des (or
some c ombina tion o f at least four manic and major depres sive episo des) within one y ear.

Risk F actors f or Bipolar Disor der
Bipolar disorder is c onsidera bly les s fre quent than major depres sive disorder . In the Unite d Sta tes, 1 out o f
every 167 p eople meets the criteria f or bip olar disorder e ach y ear, and 1 out o f 100 meet the criteria within
their lif etime (Merikang as et al ., 2011). The ra tes are higher in men than in w omen , and a bout half o f those
with this disorder rep ort onset b efore the a ge of 25 (Merikang as et al ., 2011). Around 90% o f those with bip olar
disorder ha ve a c omorbid disorder , mos t often an anxiety disorder or a subs tanc e abuse problem .
Unfortuna tely, close to half o f the p eople suff ering from bip olar disorder do not rec eive tre atment (Merikang as
& Tohen , 2011). Suicide ra tes are e xtremely high among those with bip olar disorder: around 36% o f
individuals with this disorder a ttempt suicide a t least onc e in their lif etime (N ovick , Sw artz, & F rank , 2010),
and b etween 15%–19% die b y suicide (N ewman , 2004).
The Biological Basis of Mood and Bipolar Disor ders
Mood disorders ha ve been sho wn to ha ve a s trong g enetic and biologic al basis . Relatives o f those with major
depres sive disorder ha ve double the risk o f dev eloping major depres sive disorder , where as rela tives o f patients
with bip olar disorder ha ve over nine times the risk (Merikang as et al ., 2011). The ra te of concordanc e for major
depres sive disorder is higher among identic al twins than fra ternal twins (50% vs . 38%, resp ectiv ely), as is tha t
of bip olar disorder (67% vs . 16%, resp ectiv ely), sugg esting tha t genetic factors pla y a s trong er role in bip olar
disorder than in major depres sive disorder (Merikang as et al . 2011).
People with mo od disorders o ften ha ve imb alanc es in c ertain neurotransmit ters , particularly norepinephrine
and serotonin ( Thase , 2009). These neurotransmit ters are imp ortant regula tors o f the b odily functions tha t are
disr upte d in mo od disorders , including app etite , sex driv e, sleep , arousal , and mo od. Me dications tha t are
used to tre at major depres sive disorder typic ally b oost serotonin and norepinephrine activity , where as
lithium—use d in the tre atment o f bip olar disorder —blo cks norepinephrine activity a t the s ynapses ( Figure

Depres sion is link ed to a bnormal activity in sev eral regions o f the brain (F itzgerald , Laird , Maller , & Daskalakis ,
2008) including those imp ortant in as sessing the emotional signific ance of stimuli and e xperiencing emotions
(am ygdala), and in regula ting and c ontrolling emotions ( like the prefrontal c ortex, or PF C) (LeMoult ,
Castongua y, Joormann , & Mc Aleavey, 2013). P eople with depres sion sho w elev ated am ygdala activity (Drev ets,
Bog ers, & Raichle , 2002), esp ecially when presente d with neg ative emotional s timuli , such as photos o f sad
faces (Figure 15.17 ) (Surguladz e et al ., 2005). Interes tingly , heightene d am ygdala activ ation to neg ative
emotional s timuli among depres sed persons o ccurs ev en when s timuli are presente d outside o f conscious
awarenes s (Victor , Furey, Fromm , Öhman , & Drev ets, 2010), and it p ersis ts ev en a fter the neg ative emotional
stimuli are no long er present (Siegle , Thompson , Carter, Steinha uer, & Thase , 2007). A dditionally , depres sed
individuals e xhibit les s activ ation in the prefrontal , particularly on the left side (Da vidson , Pizza galli, &
Nitschk e, 2009). Bec ause the PF C can damp en am ygdala activ ation , thereb y ena bling one to suppres s neg ative
emotions (Phan et al ., 2005), decre ased activ ation in c ertain regions o f the PF C ma y inhibit its a bility to
override neg ative emotions tha t might then le ad to more neg ative mo od states (Da vidson et al ., 2009). These
findings sugg est tha t people with depres sion are more prone to re act to emotionally neg ative stimuli , yet ha ve
greater difficulty c ontrolling these re actions .15.7 • Mood and R elated Disor ders 565

Sinc e the 1950s , rese archers ha ve note d tha t depres sed individuals ha ve abnormal lev els o f cortisol , a s tres s
hormone rele ased into the blo od by the neuro endo crine s ystem during times o f stres s (Mackin & Y oung , 2004).
When c ortisol is rele ased, the b ody initia tes a fight -or-flight resp onse in re action to a thre at or dang er. Man y
people with depres sion sho w elev ated cortisol lev els (Holsb oer & Ising , 2010), esp ecially those rep orting a
history of early lif e tra uma such as the los s of a p arent or a buse during childho od (Baes , Tofoli, Mar tins , &
Juruena, 2012). Such findings raise the ques tion o f whether high c ortisol lev els are a c ause or a c onse quenc e of
depres sion . High lev els o f cortisol are a risk factor f or future depres sion (Hallig an, Herb ert, Go odyer, & Murra y,
2007), and c ortisol activ ates activity in the am ygdala while de activ ating activity in the PF C (McE wen,
2005)—b oth brain dis turb ances are c onnecte d to depres sion . Thus , high c ortisol lev els ma y ha ve a c ausal
effect on depres sion , as w ell as on its brain function a bnormalities ( van P raag, 2005). A lso, because s tres s
results in incre ased cortisol rele ase (Micha ud, Ma theson , Kelly, Anisman , 2008), it is e qually re asona ble to
assume tha t stres s ma y precipita te depres sion .
A Diathesis-Str ess Model and Major Depr essive Disor ders
Indee d, it has long b een b eliev ed tha t stres sful lif e ev ents c an trigg er depres sion , and rese arch has
consis tently supp orted this c onclusion (Mazure , 1998). Stres sful lif e ev ents include signific ant los ses, such as
death o f a lo ved one , div orce or sep aration , and serious he alth and mone y problems; lif e ev ents such as these
often prec ede the onset o f depres sive episo des (Bro wn & Harris , 1989). In p articular , exit ev ents —ins tanc es in
which an imp ortant p erson dep arts (e .g., a de ath, div orce or sep aration , or a family memb er le aving
home)— often o ccur prior to an episo de (P aykel, 2003). Exit ev ents are esp ecially lik ely to trigg er depres sion if
these happ enings o ccur in a w ay tha t humilia tes or dev alues the individual . For e xample , people who
experienc e the bre akup o f a rela tionship initia ted by the other p erson dev elop major depres sive disorder a t a
rate more than 2 times tha t of people who e xperienc e the de ath o f a lo ved one (K endler , Het tema, B utera,
Gardner , & P resc ott, 2003).
Likewise , individuals who are e xposed to tra uma tic s tres s during childho od—such as sep aration from a p arent ,
family turmoil , and maltre atment (ph ysical or se xual a buse)—are a t a heightene d risk o f dev eloping depres sion
at an y point in their liv es (K essler, 1997). A rec ent review o f 16 s tudies in volving o ver 23,000 subjects
conclude d tha t those who e xperienc e childho od maltre atment are more than 2 times as lik ely to dev elop
recurring and p ersis tent depres sion (N anni , Uher , & Danese , 2012).
Of c ourse , not ev eryone who e xperienc es stres sful lif e ev ents or childho od adv ersities suc cumbs to
depres sion—indee d, mos t do not . Cle arly , a dia thesis -stres s interpreta tion o f major depres sive disorder , in
which c ertain pre disp ositions or vulnera bility factors influenc e one ’s reaction to s tres s, would seem logic al. If
so, wha t might such pre disp ositions b e? A s tudy b y Caspi and others (2003) sugg ests tha t an altera tion in a
specific g ene tha t regula tesserotonin (the 5-HT TLPR g ene) might b e one culprit . These in vestigators f ound
that people who e xperienc ed sev eral s tres sful lif e ev ents w ere signific antly more lik ely to e xperienc e episo des
of major depres sion if the y carrie d one or tw o shor t versions o f this g ene than if the y carrie d tw o long v ersions .
Those who c arrie d one or tw o shor t versions o f the 5-HT TLPR g ene w ere unlik ely to e xperienc e an episo de,
however, if the y had e xperienc ed few or no s tres sful lif e ev ents . Numerous s tudies ha ve replic ated these566 15 • P sychological Disor ders

findings , including s tudies o f people who e xperienc ed maltre atment during childho od (Go odman & Brand ,
2009). In a rec ent in vestigation c onducte d in the Unite d King dom (Bro wn & Harris , 2013), rese archers f ound
that childho od maltre atment b efore a ge 9 elev ated the risk o f chronic adult depres sion (a depres sion episo de
lasting f or a t least 12 months) among those individuals ha ving one (LS ) or tw o (SS) shor t versions o f the
5-HT TLPR g ene ( Figure 15.18 ). Childho od maltre atment did not incre ase the risk f or chronic depres sion f or
those ha ve tw o long (LL) v ersions o f this g ene. Thus , genetic vulnera bility ma y be one mechanism through
which s tres s potentially le ads to depres sion .
FIGURE 15.18 A study on g ene-environment int eraction in people e xperiencing chr onic depr ession in adul thood
suggests a much higher incidenc e in individuals with a shor t version o f the g ene in c ombination with childhood

Cognitive Theories of Depr ession
Cognitiv e theories o f depres sion tak e the view tha t depres sion is trigg ered by neg ative thoughts ,
interpreta tions , self -evalua tions , and e xpecta tions (J oormann , 2009). These diathesis -stres s mo dels prop ose
that depres sion is trigg ered by a “ cognitiv e vulnera bility ” (neg ative and maladaptiv e thinking ) and b y
precipita ting s tres sful lif e ev ents (Gotlib & J oormann , 2010). P erhaps the mos t well-kno wn c ognitiv e theor y of
depres sion w as dev elop ed in the 1960s b y ps ychia trist Aaron Beck , based on clinic al obser vations and
supp orted by rese arch (Beck , 2008). Beck theoriz ed tha t depres sion-prone p eople p ossess depres sive
schemas , or mental pre disp ositions to think a bout mos t things in a neg ative way (Beck , 1976). Depres sive
schemas c ontain themes o f los s, failure , rejection , worthles snes s, and inade quacy , and ma y dev elop e arly in
childho od in resp onse to adv erse e xperienc es, then remain dormant until the y are activ ated by stres sful or
negative life ev ents . Depres sive schemas prompt dy sfunctional and p essimis tic thoughts a bout the self, the
world , and the future . Beck b eliev ed tha t this dy sfunctional s tyle o f thinking is maintaine d by cognitiv e biases ,
or errors in ho w w e pro cess inf orma tion a bout ourselv es, which le ad us to f ocus on neg ative asp ects o f
experienc es, interpret things neg atively, and blo ck p ositiv e memories (Beck , 2008). A p erson whose
depres sive schema c onsis ts of a theme o f rejection might b e overly a ttentiv e to so cial cues o f rejection (more
likely to notic e another ’s fro wn), and the y might interpret this cue as a sign o f rejection and a utoma tically
rememb er p ast incidents o f rejection . Longitudinal s tudies ha ve supp orted Beck ’s theor y, in sho wing tha t a
pree xisting tendency to eng age in this neg ative, self -def eating s tyle o f thinking—when c ombine d with lif e
stres s—over time pre dicts the onset o f depres sion (Do zois & Beck , 2008). C ognitiv e therapies f or depres sion ,
aime d at changing a depres sed person ’s neg ative thinking , were dev elop ed as an e xpansion o f this theor y
(Beck , 1976).
Another c ognitiv e theor y of depres sion ,hop eles snes s theor y, postula tes tha t a p articular s tyle o f neg ative
thinking le ads to a sense o f hop eles snes s, which then le ads to depres sion (Abramson , Metalsky , & A lloy, 1989).
According to this theor y, hop eles snes s is an e xpecta tion tha t unple asant outc omes will o ccur or tha t desire d
outc omes will not o ccur, and there is nothing one c an do to prev ent such outc omes . A k ey as sumption o f this
theor y is tha t hop eles snes s stems from a tendency to p erceive neg ative life ev ents as ha ving s table (“It ’s nev er
going to chang e”) and glob al (“It ’s going to a ffect m y whole lif e”) causes , in c ontras t to uns table (“It ’s fixa ble”)
and sp ecific (“It applies only to this p articular situa tion ”) causes , esp ecially if these neg ative life ev ents o ccur15.7 • Mood and R elated Disor ders 567
in imp ortant lif e re alms , such as rela tionships , academic achiev ement , and the lik e. Supp ose a s tudent who
wishes to g o to la w scho ol do es p oorly on an admis sions tes t. If the s tudent inf ers neg ative life ev ents as ha ving
stable and glob al causes , the y ma y believ e tha t their p oor p erformanc e has a s table and glob al cause (“I lack
intellig ence, and it ’s going to prev ent me from ev er finding a me aningful c areer ”), as opp osed to an uns table
and sp ecific c ause (“I w as sick the da y of the e xam , so m y low sc ore w as a fluk e”). Hop eles snes s theor y pre dicts
that people who e xhibit this c ognitiv e style in resp onse to undesira ble lif e ev ents will view such ev ents as
having neg ative implic ations f or their future and self -worth, thereb y incre asing the lik eliho od of
hop eles snes s—the primar y cause o f depres sion (Abramson et al ., 1989). One s tudy tes ting hop eles snes s theor y
measure d the tendency to mak e neg ative inf erenc es for b ad lif e eff ects in p articip ants who w ere e xperiencing
unc ontrolla ble s tres sors . Over the ensuing six months , those with sc ores reflecting high c ognitiv e vulnera bility
were 7 times more lik ely to dev elop depres sion c omp ared to those with lo wer sc ores (Kleim , Gonzalo , & Ehlers ,
2011).
A third c ognitiv e theor y of depres sion f ocuses on ho w people ’s thoughts a bout their dis tres sed
moods—depres sed symptoms in p articular —can incre ase the risk and dura tion o f depres sion . This theor y,
which f ocuses on r umina tion in the dev elopment o f depres sion , was firs t describ ed in the la te 1980s to e xplain
the higher ra tes o f depres sion in w omen than in men (N olen-Ho eksema, 1987). Ruminat ion is the rep etitiv e
and p assive focus on the fact tha t one is depres sed and dw elling on depres sed symptoms , rather tha t
distracting one ’s self from the s ymptoms or a ttempting to addres s them in an activ e, problem-solving manner
(Nolen-Ho eksema, 1991). When p eople r umina te, the y ha ve thoughts such as “ Why am I so unmotiv ated? I jus t
can’t get going . I’m nev er g oing to g et m y work done f eeling this w ay” (N olen-Ho eksema & Hilt , 2009, p . 393).
Women are more lik ely than men to r umina te when the y are sad or depres sed (B utler & N olen-Ho eksema,
1994), and the tendency to r umina te is as sociated with incre ases in depres sion s ymptoms (N olen-Ho eksema,
Larson , & Gra yson, 1999), heightene d risk o f major depres sive episo des (Ab ela & Hankin , 2011), and
chronicity o f such episo des (R obinson & A lloy, 2003)
Suicide
For some p eople with mo od disorders , the e xtreme emotional p ain the y experienc e becomes unendura ble.
Overwhelme d by hop eles snes s, dev astated by inc apacita ting f eelings o f worthles snes s, and burdene d with the
inability to ade qua tely c ope with such f eelings , the y ma y consider suicide to b e a re asona ble w ay out .Suicide ,
define d by the CD C as “ death caused by self -directe d injurious b ehavior with an y intent to die as the result o f
the b ehavior ” (CD C, 2013a), in a sense represents an outc ome o f sev eral things g oing wrong all a t the same
time (C rosb y, Ortega, & Melanson , 2011). N ot only mus t the p erson b e biologic ally or ps ychologic ally
vulnera ble, but the y mus t also ha ve the me ans to p erform the suicidal act , and the y mus t lack the nec essary
protectiv e factors (e .g., so cial supp ort from friends and family , religion , coping skills , and problem-solving
skills) tha t pro vide c omf ort and ena ble one to c ope during times o f crisis or gre at psychologic al pain (Berman ,
2009).
Suicide is not lis ted as a disorder in the DSM-5; ho wever, people with a mental disorder —especially a mo od
disorder —ha ve the gre atest risk f or suicide . Around 90% o f those who die b y suicide ha ve a dia gnosis o f at least
one mental disorder , with mo od disorders b eing the mos t fre quent (Fleischman , Ber tolote , Belf er, & Be autrais ,
2005). In fact , the as sociation b etween major depres sive disorder and suicide is so s trong tha t one o f the
criteria f or the disorder is thoughts o f suicide , as discus sed above (AP A, 2013).
Suicide ra tes c an b e difficult to interpret b ecause some de aths tha t app ear to b e ac cidental ma y in fact b e acts
of suicide (e .g., automobile crash). N evertheles s, investigations into U .S. suicide ra tes ha ve unc overed these
facts:
•Suicide w as the 10th le ading c ause o f death for all a ges in 2010 (C enters f or Dise ase C ontrol and

•From 1991 to 2003, suicide ra tes w ere c onsis tently higher among those 65 y ears and older . Sinc e 2001,
however, suicide ra tes among those a ges 25–64 ha ve risen c onsis tently , and , sinc e 2006, suicide ra tes
have been gre ater f or those a ges 65 and older (CD C, 2013b). This incre ase in suicide ra tes among middle -

Contrar y to p opular b elief, suicide ra tes p eak during the springtime (A pril and Ma y), not during the holida y
season or winter . In fact , suicide ra tes are g enerally lo west during the winter months (P ostolache et al ., 2010).
Risk F actors F or Suicide
Suicidal risk is esp ecially high among p eople with subs tanc e use problems . Individuals with alc ohol
dep endenc e are a t 10 times gre ater risk f or suicide than the g eneral p opula tion ( Wilcox, Conner , & C aine ,
2004). The risk o f suicidal b ehavior is esp ecially high among those who ha ve made a prior suicide a ttempt .
Among those who a ttempt suicide , 16% mak e another a ttempt within a y ear and o ver 21% mak e another
attempt within f our y ears (O wens, Horro cks, & House , 2002). Suicidal individuals ma y be at high risk f or
termina ting their lif e if the y ha ve a lethal me ans in which to act , such as a fire arm in the home (Brent & Bridg e,
2003). W ithdra wal from so cial rela tionships , feeling as though one is a burden to others , and eng aging in
reckles s and risk -taking b ehaviors ma y be precursors to suicidal b ehavior (Berman , 2009). A sense o f
entrapment or f eeling una ble to esc ape one ’s misera ble f eelings or e xternal circums tanc es (e .g., an a busiv e
rela tionship with no p erceived way out) pre dicts suicidal b ehavior (O ’Connor , Sm yth, Ferguson , Ryan, &
Williams , 2013). T ragically, rep orts of suicides among adolesc ents f ollowing ins tanc es o f cyb erbullying ha ve
emerg ed in rec ent y ears. In one widely -publiciz ed case a f ew y ears a go, Pho ebe Princ e, a 15- year-old
Mas sachuset ts high scho ol student , die d by suicide f ollowing inc essant haras sment and ta unting from her
clas sma tes via te xting and F acebook (McC abe, 2010).
Suicides c an ha ve a c onta gious eff ect on p eople . For e xample , another ’s suicide , esp ecially tha t of a family
memb er, heightens one ’s risk o f suicide (Ag erbo, Nordento ft, & Mor tensen , 2002). A dditionally , widely -
publiciz ed suicides tend to trigg er additional suicides in some individuals . One s tudy e xamining suicide
statistics in the Unite d Sta tes from 1947–1967 f ound tha t the ra tes o f suicide incre ased signific antly f or the
first month a fter a rep ort about suicide w as printe d on the front p age of the New Y ork Times (Phillips , 1974).
Austrian rese archers f ound a signific ant incre ase in the numb er o f suicides b y fire arms in the three w eeks
following e xtensiv e rep orts in A ustria’s larg est new spaper o f a c elebrity suicide b y gun (Etz ersdor fer, Vorac ek,
& Sonneck , 2004). A review o f 42 s tudies c onclude d tha t me dia c overage of celebrity suicides is more than 14
times more lik ely to trigg er copycat suicides than is c overage of non-c elebrity suicides (Stack , 2000). This
review also demons trated tha t the me dium o f coverage is imp ortant: televise d stories are c onsidera bly les s
likely to prompt a surg e in suicides than are new spaper stories . Research sugg ests tha t a trend app ears to b e
emerging whereb y people use online so cial me dia to le ave suicide notes , although it is not cle ar to wha t extent
suicide notes on such me dia might induc e subse quent suicides (R uder , Ha tch, Amp anozi, Thali , & F ischer ,
2011). N evertheles s, it is re asona ble to c onjecture tha t suicide notes left b y individuals on so cial me dia ma y
influenc e the decisions o f other vulnera ble p eople who enc ounter them (L uxton , June , & F airall , 2012).
One p ossible c ontributing factor in suicide is brain chemis try. Contemp orar y neurologic al rese arch sho ws tha t
disturb ances in the functioning o fserotonin are link ed to suicidal b ehavior (P ompili et al ., 2010). Lo w lev els o f
serotonin pre dict future suicide a ttempts and de ath b y suicide , and lo w lev els ha ve been obser ved post-15.7 • Mood and R elated Disor ders 569
mor tem among suicide victims (Mann , 2003). Serotonin dy sfunction , as note d earlier , is also kno wn to pla y an
imp ortant role in depres sion; lo w lev els o f serotonin ha ve also b een link ed to a ggres sion and impulsivity
(Stanle y et al ., 2000). The c ombina tion o f these three characteris tics c onstitutes a p otential f ormula f or
suicide —especially violent suicide . A clas sic s tudy c onducte d during the 1970s f ound tha t patients with major
depres sive disorder who had v ery low lev els o f serotonin a ttempte d suicide more fre quently and more
violently than did p atients with higher lev els (Asb erg, Thorén , Träskman , Ber tilsson, & Ringb erger, 1976;
Mann , 2003).

Schiz ophrenia is a ps ychologic al disorder tha t is characteriz ed by major dis turb ances in thought , perception ,
emotion , and b ehavior . Ab out 1% o f the p opula tion e xperienc es schiz ophrenia in their lif etime , and usually the
disorder is firs t dia gnose d during e arly adultho od (early to mid-20s). Mos t people with schiz ophrenia
experienc e signific ant difficulties in man y da y-to-day activities , such as holding a job , paying bills , caring f or
oneself ( grooming and h ygiene), and maintaining rela tionships with others . Frequent hospitaliza tions are
more o ften the r ule ra ther than the e xception with schiz ophrenia. E ven when the y rec eive the b est tre atments
available, man y with schiz ophrenia will c ontinue to e xperienc e serious so cial and o ccup ational imp airment
throughout their liv es.
Wha t is schiz ophrenia? F irst, schiz ophrenia is not a condition in volving a split p ersonality; tha t is,
schiz ophrenia is not the same thing as dis sociative identity disorder ( better kno wn as multiple p ersonality
disorder). These disorders are sometimes c onfuse d because the w ord schiz ophrenia first coine d by the Swis s
psychia trist Eug en Bleuler in 1911, deriv es from Greek w ords tha t ref er to a “ split ting ” (schiz o) of psychic
functions (phrene) (Green , 2001).
Schiz ophrenia is c onsidere d a ps ychotic disorder , or one in which the p erson ’s thoughts , perceptions , and
behaviors are imp aire d to the p oint where the y are not a ble to function normally in lif e. In inf ormal terms , one
who suff ers from a ps ychotic disorder (tha t is, has a ps ychosis) is disc onnecte d from the w orld in which mos t
of us liv e.
Symptoms of Schiz ophr enia
The main s ymptoms o f schiz ophrenia include hallucina tions , delusions , disorg aniz ed thinking , disorg aniz ed
or a bnormal motor b ehavior , and neg ative symptoms (AP A, 2013). A hallucinat ion is a p erceptual e xperienc e
that occurs in the a bsenc e of external s timula tion . Auditor y hallucina tions ( hearing v oices) o ccur in roughly
two-thirds o f patients with schiz ophrenia and are b y far the mos t common f orm o f hallucina tion (Andre asen ,
1987). The v oices ma y be familiar or unfamiliar , the y ma y ha ve a c onversa tion or argue , or the v oices ma y
provide a r unning c ommentar y on the p erson ’s behavior ( Tsuang , Farone , & Green , 1999).570 15 • P sychological Disor ders
Access for fr ee a t opens tax. org
Less common are visual hallucina tions (seeing things tha t are not there) and olfactor y hallucina tions (smelling
odors tha t are not actually present).
Delusions are b eliefs tha t are c ontrar y to re ality and are firmly held ev en in the fac e of contradictor y evidenc e.
Man y of us hold b eliefs tha t some w ould c onsider o dd, but a delusion is e asily identifie d because it is cle arly
absurd . A p erson with schiz ophrenia ma y believ e tha t their mother is plot ting with the FBI to p oison their
coffee, or tha t their neighb or is an enem y sp y who w ants to kill them . These kinds o f delusions are kno wn as
paranoid delusions , which in volve the (false) b elief tha t other p eople or a gencies are plot ting to harm the
person . People with schiz ophrenia also ma y hold grandiose delusions , beliefs tha t one holds sp ecial p ower,
unique kno wledge, or is e xtremely imp ortant . For e xample , the p erson who claims to b e Jesus Chris t, or who
claims to ha ve kno wledge going b ack 5,000 y ears, or who claims to b e a gre at philosopher is e xperiencing
grandiose delusions . Other delusions include the b elief tha t one ’s thoughts are b eing remo ved (thought
withdra wal) or thoughts ha ve been plac ed inside one ’s he ad (thought inser tion). Another typ e of delusion is
somat ic delusion , which is the b elief tha t something highly a bnormal is happ ening to one ’s body (e .g., tha t
one’s kidne ys are b eing e aten b y cockro aches).
Disor ganiz ed thinking refers to disjointe d and inc oherent thought pro cesses—usually detecte d by wha t a
person sa ys. The p erson might ramble , exhibit lo ose as sociations ( jump from topic to topic), or talk in a w ay
that is so disorg aniz ed and inc omprehensible tha t it seems as though the p erson is randomly c ombining
words . Disorg aniz ed thinking is also e xhibite d by bla tantly illogic al remarks (e .g., “F enway Park is in Bos ton. I
live in Bos ton. Theref ore, I liv e at Fenway Park.”) and b y tang entiality: resp onding to others’ s tatements or
ques tions b y remarks tha t are either b arely rela ted or unrela ted to wha t was said or ask ed. For e xample , if a
person dia gnose d with schiz ophrenia is ask ed if the y are interes ted in rec eiving sp ecial job training , the y
might s tate tha t the y onc e ro de on a train somewhere . To a p erson with schiz ophrenia, the tang ential (slightly
rela ted) connection b etween job training and riding a train are sufficient enough to c ause such a resp onse .
Disor ganiz ed or abnormal motor b eha vior refers to unusual b ehaviors and mo vements: b ecoming unusually
activ e, exhibiting silly child-lik e behaviors ( giggling and self -absorb ed smiling ), eng aging in rep eated and
purp oseles s mo vements , or displa ying o dd facial e xpres sions and g estures . In some c ases , the p erson will
exhibit catatonic b eha viors , which sho w decre ased re activity to the en vironment , such as p osturing , in which
the p erson maintains a rigid and bizarre p osture f or long p erio ds o f time , or c atatonic s tupor, a c omplete lack
of mo vement and v erbal behavior .
Negative symptoms are those tha t reflect notic eable decre ases and a bsenc es in c ertain b ehaviors , emotions ,
or driv es (Green , 2001). A p erson who e xhibits diminishe d emotional e xpres sion sho ws no emotion in their
facial e xpres sions , speech , or mo vements , even when such e xpres sions are normal or e xpecte d. Avolition is
characteriz ed by a lack o f motiv ation to eng age in self -initia ted and me aningful activity , including the mos t
basic o f tasks , such as b athing and gro oming . Alogia ref ers to re duced sp eech output; in simple terms , patients
do not sa y much . Another neg ative symptom is aso ciality , or so cial withdra wal and lack o f interes t in eng aging
in so cial interactions with others . A final neg ative symptom , anhe donia, ref ers to an ina bility to e xperienc e
pleasure . One who e xhibits anhe donia e xpres ses lit tle interes t in wha t mos t people c onsider to b e ple asura ble
activities , such as hobbies , recre ation , or se xual activity .

Causes of Schiz ophr enia
There is c onsidera ble evidenc e sugg esting tha t schiz ophrenia has a g enetic b asis . The risk o f dev eloping
schiz ophrenia is ne arly 6 times gre ater if one has a p arent with schiz ophrenia than if one do es not (Golds tein ,
Buka, Seidman , & T suang , 2010). A dditionally , one ’s risk o f dev eloping schiz ophrenia incre ases as g enetic

rela tednes s to family memb ers dia gnose d with schiz ophrenia incre ases (Got tesman , 2001).
Genes
When c onsidering the role o f genetics in schiz ophrenia, as in an y disorder , conclusions b ased on family and
twin s tudies are subject to criticism . This is b ecause family memb ers who are closely rela ted (such as siblings)
are more lik ely to share similar en vironments than are family memb ers who are les s closely rela ted (such as
cousins); fur ther , identic al twins ma y be more lik ely to b e tre ated similarly b y others than might fra ternal
twins . Thus , family and twin s tudies c annot c ompletely r ule out the p ossible eff ects o f share d en vironments
and e xperienc es. Such problems c an b e correcte d by using adoption s tudies , in which children are sep arated
from their p arents a t an e arly a ge. One o f the firs t adoption s tudies o f schiz ophrenia c onducte d by Hes ton
(1966) f ollowed 97 adoptees , including 47 who w ere b orn to mothers with schiz ophrenia, o ver a 36- year
perio d. Five of the 47 adoptees (11%) whose mothers had schiz ophrenia w ere la ter dia gnose d with
schiz ophrenia, c omp ared to none o f the 50 c ontrol adoptees . Other adoption s tudies ha ve consis tently
reported tha t for adoptees who are la ter dia gnose d with schiz ophrenia, their biologic al rela tives ha ve a higher
risk o f schiz ophrenia than do adoptiv e rela tives (Shih , Belmonte , & Zandi , 2004).
Although adoption s tudies ha ve supp orted the h ypothesis tha t genetic factors c ontribute to schiz ophrenia,
they ha ve also demons trated tha t the disorder mos t lik ely arises from a c ombina tion o f genetic and
environmental factors , rather than jus t genes themselv es. For e xample , investigators in one s tudy e xamine d
the ra tes o f schiz ophrenia among 303 adoptees ( Tienari et al ., 2004). A total o f 145 o f the adoptees had
biologic al mothers with schiz ophrenia; these adoptees c onstitute d the high g enetic risk group . The other 158
adoptees had mothers with no ps ychia tric his tory; these adoptees c omp osed the lo w genetic risk group . The
rese archers mana ged to determine whether the adoptees’ families w ere either he alth y or dis turb ed. For
example , the adoptees w ere c onsidere d to b e raise d in a dis turb ed family en vironment if the family e xhibite d a
lot o f criticism , conflict , and a lack o f problem-solving skills . The findings rev ealed tha t adoptees whose
biologic al mothers had schiz ophrenia ( high g enetic risk) and who had b een raise d in a dis turb ed family
environment w ere much more lik ely to dev elop schiz ophrenia or another ps ychotic disorder (36.8%) than
were adoptees whose biologic al mothers had schiz ophrenia but who had b een raise d in a he alth y en vironment
(5.8%), or than adoptees with a lo w genetic risk who w ere raise d in either a dis turb ed (5.3%) or he alth y (4.8%)
environment . Bec ause the adoptees who w ere a t high g enetic risk w ere lik ely to dev elop schiz ophrenia only if
they were raise d in a dis turb ed home en vironment , this s tudy supp orts a dia thesis -stres s interpreta tion o f
schiz ophrenia—b oth g enetic vulnera bility and en vironmental s tres s are nec essary for schiz ophrenia to
develop , genes alone do not sho w the c omplete picture .
Neur otransmitters
If we ac cept tha t schiz ophrenia is a t least partly g enetic in origin , as it seems to b e, it mak es sense tha t the ne xt
step should b e to identif y biologic al abnormalities c ommonly f ound in p eople with the disorder . Perhaps not
surprisingly , a numb er o f neurobiologic al factors ha ve indee d been f ound to b e rela ted to schiz ophrenia. One
such factor tha t has rec eived considera ble a ttention f or man y years is the neurotransmit ter dop amine . Interes t
in the role o f dop amine in schiz ophrenia w as s timula ted by tw o sets o f findings: dr ugs tha t incre ase dop amine
levels c an pro duce schiz ophrenia-lik e symptoms , and me dications tha t blo ck dop amine activity re duce the
symptoms (Ho wes & K apur , 2009). The dop amine h ypothesis of schiz ophrenia prop osed tha t an
overabundanc e of dop amine or to o man y dop amine rec eptors are resp onsible f or the onset and maintenanc e
of schiz ophrenia (Sn yder, 1976). More rec ent w ork in this are a sugg ests tha t abnormalities in dop amine v ary
by brain region and thus c ontribute to s ymptoms in unique w ays. In g eneral , this rese arch has sugg ested tha t
an o verabundanc e of dop amine in the limbic s ystem ma y be resp onsible f or some s ymptoms , such as
hallucina tions and delusions , where as lo w lev els o f dop amine in the prefrontal c ortex might b e resp onsible
primarily f or the neg ative symptoms (a volition , alogia, aso ciality , and anhe donia) (Da vis, Kahn , Ko, & Da vidson ,
1991). In rec ent y ears, serotonin has rec eived attention , and new er antips ychotic me dications use d to tre at the
disorder w ork b y blo cking serotonin rec eptors (Ba umeis ter & Ha wkins , 2004).572 15 • P sychological Disor ders

Brain Anatomy
Brain ima ging s tudies rev eal tha t people with schiz ophrenia ha ve enlarg edventricles , the c avities within the
brain tha t contain c erebral spinal fluid (Green , 2001). This finding is imp ortant b ecause larg er than normal
ventricles sugg ests tha t various brain regions are re duced in siz e, thus implying tha t schiz ophrenia is
associated with a los s of brain tis sue. In addition , man y people with schiz ophrenia displa y a re duction in gra y
matter (c ell b odies o f neurons) in the frontal lob es (La wrie & Abukmeil , 1998), and man y sho w les s frontal lob e
activity when p erforming c ognitiv e tasks (B uchsb aum et al ., 1990). The frontal lob es are imp ortant in a v ariety
of comple x cognitiv e functions , such as planning and e xecuting b ehavior , attention , speech , mo vement , and
problem solving . Henc e, abnormalities in this region pro vide merit in e xplaining wh y people with
schiz ophrenia e xperienc e deficits in these o f are as.
Events During Pr egnancy
Why do p eople with schiz ophrenia ha ve these brain a bnormalities? A numb er o f environmental factors tha t
could imp act normal brain dev elopment might b e at fault. High ra tes o f obs tetric c omplic ations in the bir ths o f
children who la ter dev elop ed schiz ophrenia ha ve been rep orted (C annon , Jones , & Murra y, 2002). In addition ,
people are a t an incre ased risk f or dev eloping schiz ophrenia if their mother w as e xposed to influenza during
the firs t trimes ter o f pregnancy (Bro wn et al ., 2004). R esearch has also sugg ested tha t a p erson ’s emotional
stres s during pregnancy ma y incre ase the risk o f schiz ophrenia in o ffspring . One s tudy rep orted tha t the risk
of schiz ophrenia is elev ated subs tantially in o ffspring whose mothers e xperienc ed the de ath o f a rela tive
during the firs t trimes ter o f pregnancy (Khashan et al ., 2008).
Marijuana
Another v aria ble tha t is link ed to schiz ophrenia is marijuana use. Although a numb er o f rep orts ha ve sho wn
that individuals with schiz ophrenia are more lik ely to use marijuana than are individuals without
schiz ophrenia ( Thornicro ft, 1990), such in vestigations c annot determine if marijuana use le ads to
schiz ophrenia, or vic e versa. Ho wever, a numb er o f longitudinal s tudies ha ve sugg ested tha t marijuana use is ,
in fact , a risk factor f or schiz ophrenia. A clas sic in vestigation o f over 45,000 Sw edish militar y personnel who
were f ollowed up a fter 15 y ears f ound tha t those individuals who had rep orted using marijuana a t least onc e by
the time the y were c onscripte d (dra fted) into the militar y were more than 2 times as lik ely to dev elop
schiz ophrenia during the ensuing 15 y ears than w ere those who rep orted nev er using marijuana; those who
had indic ated using marijuana 50 or more times w ere 6 times as lik ely to dev elop schiz ophrenia (André asson,
Allbeck, Engs tröm , & R ydberg, 1987). More rec ently , a review o f 35 longitudinal s tudies f ound a subs tantially
incre ased risk o f schiz ophrenia and other ps ychotic disorders in p eople who had use d marijuana, with the
greatest risk in the mos t fre quent users (Mo ore et al ., 2007). Other w ork has f ound tha t marijuana use is
associated with an onset o f psychotic disorders a t an e arlier a ge (Larg e, Sharma, C ompton , Slade , & Niels sen,
2011). O verall , the a vailable evidenc e seems to indic ate tha t marijuana use pla ys a c ausal role in the
development o f schiz ophrenia, although it is imp ortant to p oint out tha t marijuana use is not an es sential or
sufficient risk factor as not all p eople with schiz ophrenia ha ve use d marijuana and the majority o f marijuana
users do not dev elop schiz ophrenia (C asadio , Fernandes , Murra y, & Di F orti, 2011). One pla usible
interpreta tion o f the da ta is tha t early marijuana use ma y disr upt normal brain dev elopment during imp ortant
early ma tura tion p erio ds in adolesc ence (Trezza, Cuomo , & V anderschuren , 2008). Thus , early marijuana use
may set the s tage for the dev elopment o f schiz ophrenia and other ps ychotic disorders , esp ecially among
individuals with an es tablishe d vulnera bility (C asadio et al ., 2011).

In Aug ust 2013, 17- year-old Cody Metzk er-Madsen at tack ed 5- year-old Dominic Elkins on his f oster par ents’

been characteriz ed as a “piec e of psychia tric f olklore dev oid o f convincing empiric al supp ort” (McN ally, 2003,

in ps ychia tric p opula tions (F oote, Smolin , Kaplan , Leg att, & Lipschitz, 2006).
Depersonaliz ation/Der ealiz ation Disor der
Dep ersonalizat ion/dere alizat ion disorder is characteriz ed by recurring episo des o f dep ersonaliza tion ,
dere aliza tion , or b oth. Dep ersonaliza tion is define d as f eelings o f “unre ality or detachment from , or
unfamiliarity with , one ’s whole self or from asp ects o f the self ” (AP A, 2013, p . 302). Individuals who e xperienc e
dep ersonaliza tion might b eliev e their thoughts and f eelings are not their o wn; the y ma y feel rob otic as though
they lack c ontrol o ver their mo vements and sp eech; the y ma y experienc e a dis torted sense o f time and , in
extreme c ases , the y ma y sense an “ out-of-body” experienc e in which the y see themselv es from the v anta ge
point o f another p erson .Dere aliza tion is conceptualiz ed as a sense o f “unre ality or detachment from , or
unfamiliarity with , the w orld , be it individuals , inanima te objects , or all surroundings” (AP A, 2013, p . 303). A
person who e xperienc es dere aliza tion might f eel as though the y are in a f og or a dre am, or tha t the
surrounding w orld is someho w ar tificial and unre al. Individuals with dep ersonaliza tion/dere aliza tion disorder
often ha ve difficulty describing their s ymptoms and ma y think the y are g oing crazy (AP A, 2013).
Dissociative Identity Disor der
By far , the mos t well-kno wn dis sociative disorder is dissociat ive ident ity disorder (formerly c alled multiple
personality disorder). P eople with dis sociative identity disorder e xhibit tw o or more sep arate p ersonalities or
identities , each w ell-define d and dis tinct from one another . The y also e xperienc e memor y gaps f or the time
during which another identity is in charg e (e.g., one might find unfamiliar items in their shopping b ags or
among their p ossessions), and in some c ases ma y rep ort he aring v oices, such as a child ’s voice or the sound o f
someb ody cr ying (AP A, 2013). The s tudy o f ups tate N ew Y ork residents mentione d above (Johnson et al ., 2006)
reported tha t 1.5% o f their sample e xperienc ed symptoms c onsis tent with dis sociative identity disorder in the
previous y ear.
Dissociative identity disorder (DID) is highly c ontro versial . Some b eliev e tha t people fak e symptoms to a void
the c onse quenc es o f illeg al actions (e .g., “I am not resp onsible f or shoplifting b ecause it w as m y other
personality ”). In fact , it has b een demons trated tha t people are g enerally skille d at adopting the role o f a
person with diff erent p ersonalities when the y believ e it might b e adv anta geous to do so . As an e xample ,
Kenneth Bianchi w as an infamous serial killer who , along with his c ousin , murdere d over a do zen girls and
women around Los Ang eles in the la te 1970s . Eventually , he and his c ousin w ere apprehende d. At Bianchi ’s
trial , he ple d not guilty b y re ason o f insanity , presenting himself as though he had DID and claiming tha t a
different p ersonality (“ Stev e Walker”) commit ted the murders . When these claims w ere scr utiniz ed, he
admit ted faking the s ymptoms and w as found guilty (Sch wartz, 1981).
A sec ond re ason DID is c ontro versial is b ecause ra tes o f the disorder suddenly skyro cketed in the 1980s . More15.9 • Dis socia tive Disor ders 575
cases o f DID w ere identifie d during the fiv e years prior to 1986 than in the prec eding tw o centuries (Putnam ,
Guro ff, Silb erman , Barb an, & P ost, 1986). A lthough this incre ase ma y be due to the dev elopment o f more
sophis ticated dia gnos tic techniques , it is also p ossible tha t the p opulariza tion o f DID —help ed in p art bySybil , a
popular 1970s b ook (and la ter film) a bout a w oman with 16 diff erent p ersonalities —ma y ha ve prompte d
clinicians to o verdia gnose the disorder (Pip er & Mersk ey, 2004). C asting fur ther scr utin y on the e xistenc e of
multiple p ersonalities or identities is the rec ent sugg estion tha t the s tory of Sybil w as larg ely fa bric ated, and
the ide a for the b ook might ha ve been e xaggerated (N athan , 2011).
Despite its c ontro versial na ture , DID is cle arly a legitima te and serious disorder , and although some p eople
may fak e symptoms , others suff er their entire liv es with it . People with this disorder tend to rep ort a his tory of
childho od tra uma, some c ases ha ving b een c orrob orated through me dical or leg al rec ords (C ardeña & Gle aves,

By the end o f this section, y ou wil l be able t o:
•Describe the natur e and s ymp toms o f attention deficit/h yper activity disor der and autism spectrum disor der
•Discus s the pr evalenc e and fact ors that c ontribut e to the de velopment o f these disor ders
Mos t of the disorders w e ha ve discus sed so far are typic ally dia gnose d in adultho od, although the y can and
sometimes do o ccur during childho od. Ho wever, there are a group o f conditions tha t, when present , are
diagnose d early in childho od, often b efore the time a child enters scho ol. These c onditions are lis ted in the
DSM-5 as neuro developmental disorders , and the y involve dev elopmental problems in p ersonal , social,
academic , and intellectual functioning (AP A, 2013). While the y are o ften dia gnose d in childho od, man y people
live with them throughout adultho od. In this section , we will discus s tw o such disorders: a ttention deficit /
hyperactivity disorder and a utism .
Attention Deficit/Hyper activity Disor der
Dieg o is alw ays activ e, from the time he w akes up in the morning until the time he g oes to b ed at night . His
mother rep orts tha t he c ame out the w omb kicking and scre aming , and he has not s topp ed mo ving sinc e. He
has a s weet disp osition , but alw ays seems to b e in trouble with his te achers , parents , and a fter-scho ol program
counselors . He seems to ac cidentally bre ak things; he los t his jack et three times las t winter , and he nev er
seems to sit s till. His te achers b eliev e he is a smar t child , but he nev er finishes an ything he s tarts and is so
impulsiv e tha t he do es not seem to le arn much in scho ol.
Dieg o lik ely has attent ion deficit /hyperact ivity disorder (ADHD) . The s ymptoms o f this disorder w ere firs t
describ ed by Hans Ho ffman in the 1920s . While taking c are o f his son while his wif e was in the hospital giving
birth to a sec ond child , Ho ffman notic ed tha t the b oy had trouble c oncentra ting on his homew ork, had a shor t
attention sp an, and had to rep eatedly g o over e asy homew ork to le arn the ma terial (J ellinek & Herz og, 1999).
Later, it w as disc overed tha t man y hyperactiv e children—those who are fidg ety, res tless, socially disr uptiv e,
and ha ve trouble with impulse c ontrol—also displa y shor t attention sp ans, problems with c oncentra tion , and
distractibility . By the 1970s , it had b ecome cle ar tha t man y children who displa y attention problems o ften also
exhibit signs o f hyperactivity . In rec ognition o f such findings , the DSM-III (publishe d in 1980) include d a new
disorder: a ttention deficit disorder with and without h yperactivity , now kno wn as a ttention deficit /
hyperactivity disorder (ADHD).
A child with ADHD sho ws a c onstant p attern o f ina ttention and/or h yperactiv e and impulsiv e behavior tha t
inter feres with normal functioning (AP A, 2013). Some o f the signs o f ina ttention include gre at difficulty with576 15 • P sychological Disor ders
Access for fr ee a t opens tax. org
and a voidanc e of tasks tha t require sus taine d attention (such as c onversa tions or re ading ), failure to f ollow
instructions (o ften resulting in failure to c omplete scho ol w ork and other duties), disorg aniza tion (difficulty
keeping things in order , poor time mana gement , slopp y and mes sy work), lack o f attention to detail , becoming
easily dis tracte d, and f orgetfulnes s. Hyp eractivity is characteriz ed by excessive mo vement , and includes
fidg eting or squirming , leaving one ’s se at in situa tions when remaining se ated is e xpecte d, having trouble
sitting s till (e .g., in a res taurant), r unning a bout and climbing on things , blur ting out resp onses b efore another
person ’s ques tion or s tatement has b een c omplete d, difficulty w aiting one ’s turn f or something , and
interr upting and intr uding on others . Frequently , the h yperactiv e child c omes acros s as nois y and b oisterous .
The child ’s behavior is has ty, impulsiv e, and seems to o ccur without much f orethought; these characteris tics
may explain wh y adolesc ents and y oung adults dia gnose d with ADHD rec eive more tra ffic tick ets and ha ve
more a utomobile ac cidents than do others ( Thompson , Molina, P elham , & Gna gy, 2007).
ADHD o ccurs in a bout 8% o f children (Danielson et al , 2016), and s tudies es tima te tha t for a bout 60% o f these
people , ADHD c ontinues into adultho od (Sible y et al 2016). On the a verage, boys are 3 times more lik ely to ha ve
ADHD than are girls; ho wever, such findings might reflect the gre ater prop ensity o f boys to eng age in
aggres sive and antiso cial b ehavior and thus incur a gre ater lik eliho od of being ref erre d to ps ychologic al clinics
(Barkle y, 2006). Children with ADHD fac e sev ere ac ademic and so cial challeng es. Comp ared to their non-
ADHD c ounterp arts, children with ADHD ha ve lower grades and s tandardiz ed tes t scores and higher ra tes o f
expulsion , grade retention , and dropping out (Lo e & F eldman , 2007). the y also are les s well-lik ed and more
often rejecte d by their p eers (Ho za et al ., 2005).
A rec ent s tudy f ound tha t ne arly 81% o f those whose ADHD p ersis ted into adultho od had e xperienc ed at least
one other c omorbid disorder , comp ared to 47% o f those whose ADHD did not p ersis t (Barb aresi et al ., 2013).
Life Pr oblems fr om ADHD
Children with ADHD fac e considera bly w orse long-term outc omes than do those children who do not ha ve
ADHD . Adults dia gnose d with ADHD in childho od, but not tre ated for ADHD , have been rep orted to ha ve poor
outc omes in a wide rang e of are as o f life, including so cial function , educ ation , criminality , alc ohol use ,
subs tanc e use , and o ccup ational outc omes (Arnold et al , 2015). In one in vestigation , 135 adults who had b een
identifie d as ha ving ADHD s ymptoms in the 1970s w ere c ontacte d dec ades la ter and inter view ed (Klein et al .,
2012). C omp ared to a c ontrol sample o f 136 p articip ants who had nev er b een dia gnose d with ADHD , those who
were dia gnose d as children:
•had w orse e ducational a ttainment (more lik ely to ha ve dropp ed out o f high scho ol and les s lik ely to ha ve
earne d a b achelor ’s degree);
•had lo wer so cioeconomic s tatus;
•held les s pres tigious o ccup ational p ositions;
•were more lik ely to b e unemplo yed;
•made c onsidera bly les s in salar y;
•scored worse on a me asure o f occup ational functioning (indic ating , for e xample , lower job sa tisfaction ,
poorer w ork rela tionships , and more firings);
•scored worse on a me asure o f social functioning (indic ating , for e xample , fewer friendships and les s
involvement in so cial activities);
•were more lik ely to b e div orced; and
•were more lik ely to ha ve non-alc ohol-rela ted subs tanc e abuse problems . (Klein et al ., 2012)
Longitudinal s tudies also sho w tha t children dia gnose d with ADHD are a t higher risk f or subs tanc e abuse
problems . One s tudy rep orted tha t childho od ADHD pre dicte d later drinking problems , daily smoking , and use
of marijuana and other illicit dr ugs (Molina & P elham , 2003). The risk o f subs tanc e abuse problems app ears to
be ev en gre ater f or those with ADHD who also e xhibit antiso cial tendencies (Marshal & Molina, 2006).
Diagnosis , tre atment , and g eneral a warenes s of ADHD has c ertainly impro ved in the dec ades sinc e the p eople15.10 • Disor ders in Childhood 577
in the a bove studies w ere dia gnose d. Studies tha t include more rec ent outc omes sho w positiv e eff ects o f
treatment as opp osed to non-tre atment (Harpin , 2013; Arnold 2015). In mos t cases , the same s tudies indic ate
that more rese arch and w ork nee ds to b e under taken to unders tand the mos t eff ect tre atments and their
imp acts .
Causes of ADHD
Family and twin s tudies indic ate tha t genetics pla y a signific ant role in the dev elopment o f ADHD . Burt (2009),
in a review o f 26 s tudies , rep orted tha t the me dian ra te of concordanc e for identic al twins w as .66 (one s tudy
reported a ra te of .90), where as the me dian c oncordanc e ra te for fra ternal twins w as .20. This s tudy also f ound
that the me dian c oncordanc e ra te for unrela ted (adoptiv e) siblings w as .09; although this numb er is small , it is
greater than 0, thus sugg esting tha t the en vironment ma y ha ve at least some influenc e. Another review o f
studies c onclude d tha t the herita bility o f ina ttention and h yperactivity w ere 71% and 73%, resp ectiv ely
(Nik olas & B urt, 2010).
The sp ecific g enes in volved in ADHD are thought to include a t least two tha t are imp ortant in the regula tion o f
the neurotransmit ter dop amine (Giz er, Ficks , & W aldman , 2009), sugg esting tha t dop amine ma y be imp ortant
in ADHD . Indee d, me dications use d in the tre atment o f ADHD , such as meth ylphenida te (Ritalin) and
amphetamine with de xtro amphetamine (A dderall), ha ve stimulant qualities and elev ate dop amine activity .
People with ADHD sho w les s dop amine activity in k ey regions o f the brain , esp ecially those as sociated with
motiv ation and rew ard ( Volkow et al ., 2009), which pro vides supp ort to the theor y tha t dop amine deficits ma y
be a vital factor in the dev elopment this disorder (Sw anson et al ., 2007).
Brain ima ging s tudies ha ve sho wn tha t children with ADHD e xhibit a bnormalities in their frontal lob es, an are a
in which dop amine is in a bundanc e. Comp ared to children without ADHD , those with ADHD app ear to ha ve
smaller frontal lob e volume , and the y sho w les s frontal lob e activ ation when p erforming mental tasks . Recall
that one o f the functions o f the frontal lob es is to inhibit our b ehavior . Thus , abnormalities in this region ma y
go a long w ay toward e xplaining the h yperactiv e, unc ontrolle d behavior o f ADHD .
By the 1970s , man y had b ecome a ware o f the c onnection b etween nutritional factors and childho od behavior .
At the time , much o f the public b eliev ed tha t hyperactivity w as c aused by sug ar and f ood additiv es, such as
artificial c oloring and fla voring . Undoubte dly, part of the app eal of this h ypothesis w as tha t it pro vide d a
simple e xplana tion o f (and tre atment f or) b ehavioral problems in children . A s tatistical review o f 16 s tudies ,
however, conclude d tha t sug ar consumption has no eff ect a t all on the b ehavioral and c ognitiv e performanc e of
children ( Wolraich , Wilson , & White , 1995). A dditionally , although f ood additiv es ha ve been sho wn to incre ase
hyperactivity in non-ADHD children , the eff ect is ra ther small (McC ann et al ., 2007). Numerous s tudies ,
however, have sho wn a signific ant rela tionship b etween e xposure to nic otine in cig aret te smok e during the
prena tal p erio d and ADHD (Linnet et al ., 2003). Ma ternal smoking during pregnancy is as sociated with the
development o f more sev ere s ymptoms o f the disorder ( Thak ur et al ., 2013).
Is ADHD c aused by poor p arenting? N o. Rememb er, the g enetics s tudies discus sed above sugg ested tha t the
family en vironment do es not seem to pla y much o f a role in the dev elopment o f this disorder; if it did , we
would e xpect the c oncordanc e ra tes to b e higher f or fra ternal twins and adoptiv e siblings than has b een
demons trated. All things c onsidere d, the evidenc e seems to p oint to the c onclusion tha t ADHD is trigg ered
more b y genetic and neurologic al factors and les s by so cial or en vironmental ones .
Why Is the Pr evalence R ate of ADHD Incr easing?
Man y people belie ve that the r ates o f ADHD ha ve incr eased in r ecent y ears , and ther e is e videnc e to suppor t this
contention. In a r ecent s tudy , investigators f ound that the par ent-repor ted pr evalenc e of ADHD among childr en
(4–17 y ears old) in the Unit ed Stat es incr eased b y 22% during a 4- year period, fr om 7.8% in 2003 t o 9.5% inDIG DEEPER578 15 • P sychological Disor ders

2007 (CDC, 2010). Ov er time this incr ease in par ent-repor ted ADHD w as obser ved in al l sociodemogr aphic
groups and w as reflect ed b y subs tantial incr eases in 12 s tates (Indiana , Nor th Car olina , and Color ado w ere the
top thr ee). The incr eases w ere greatest for older t eens (ag es 15–17), mul tiracial and Hispanic childr en, and
childr en with a primar y lang uage other than English. Another in vestigation f ound that fr om 1998–2000 thr ough
2007–2009 the par ent-repor ted pr evalenc e of ADHD incr eased among U .S. childr en betw een the ag es o f 5–17
years old, fr om 6.9% t o 9.0% (Akinbami, Liu, P astor, & R euben, 2011).
A major w eaknes s of both s tudies w as that childr en w ere not actual ly giv en a f ormal diagnosis . Ins tead, par ents
were simpl y ask ed whether or not a doct or or other heal th-car e provider had e ver told them their child had
ADHD; the r epor ted pr evalenc e rates thus ma y ha ve been aff ected b y the ac curacy o f par ental memor y.
Nevertheles s, the findings fr om these s tudies r aise impor tant ques tions c oncerning what appears t o be a
demons trable rise in the pr evalenc e of ADHD . Although the r easons underl ying this appar ent incr ease in the
rates o f ADHD o ver time ar e poorl y unders tood and, at bes t, speculativ e, several explanations ar e viable:
•ADHD ma y be o ver-diagnosed b y doct ors who ar e too quick t o medicat e childr en as a beha vior tr eatment.
•Ther e is gr eater awarenes s of ADHD no w than in the pas t. Nearl y everyone has hear d of ADHD , and mos t
parents and t eachers ar e aware of its k ey symp toms . Thus , par ents ma y be quick t o tak e their childr en to a
doct or if the y belie ve their child pos sesses these s ymp toms , or t eachers ma y be mor e lik ely no w than in the
past to notic e the s ymp toms and r efer the child f or evaluation.
•The use o f comput ers, video g ames , iPhones , and other electr onic de vices has bec ome per vasive among
childr en in the earl y 21s t centur y, and these de vices could pot ential ly shor ten childr en’s attentions spans .
Thus , what might seem lik e inat tention t o some par ents and t eachers c ould simpl y reflect e xposur e to too
much t echnolog y.

Autism Spectrum Disor der
A seminal p aper publishe d in 1943 b y ps ychia trist Leo K anner describ ed an unusual neuro developmental
condition he obser ved in a group o f children . He c alled this c ondition e arly infantile a utism , and it w as
characteriz ed mainly b y an ina bility to f orm close emotional ties with others , speech and langua ge
abnormalities , rep etitiv e behaviors , and an intoleranc e of minor chang es in the en vironment and in normal
routines (Bregman , 2005). Wha t the DSM-5 ref ers to as autism sp ectr um disorder today, is a direct e xtension
of Kanner ’s work.
Autism sp ectr um disorder is prob ably the mos t misunders tood of the neuro developmental disorders . Children
with this disorder sho w signs o f signific ant dis turb ances in three main are as: (a) deficits in so cial interaction ,
(b) deficits in c ommunic ation , and (c) rep etitiv e patterns o f behavior or interes ts. These dis turb ances app ear
early in lif e and c ause serious imp airments in functioning (AP A, 2013). The child with a utism sp ectr um
disorder might e xhibit deficits in so cial interaction b y not initia ting c onversa tions with other children or
turning their he ad a way when sp oken to . Typic ally, these children do not mak e eye contact with others and
seem to pref er pla ying alone ra ther than with others . In some c ases , it is almos t as though these individuals
live in a p ersonal and isola ted so cial w orld others are simply not priv y to or a ble to p enetra te. Communic ation
deficits c an rang e from a c omplete lack o f speech , to one w ord resp onses (e .g., sa ying “ Yes” or “N o” when
replying to ques tions or s tatements tha t require additional ela boration), to echo ed sp eech (e .g., parroting wha t
another p erson sa ys, either imme diately or sev eral hours or ev en da ys later), to difficulty maintaining a
conversa tion b ecause o f an ina bility to recipro cate others’ c omments . These deficits c an also include problems
in using and unders tanding non verbal cues (e .g., facial e xpres sions , gestures , and p ostures) tha t facilita te
normal c ommunic ation .
Repetitiv e patterns o f behavior or interes ts can b e exhibite d a numb er o f ways. The child might eng age in
stereotyp ed, rep etitiv e mo vements (ro cking , head-b anging , or rep eatedly dropping an object and then picking15.10 • Disor ders in Childhood 579
it up), or the y might sho w gre at dis tres s at small chang es in routine or the en vironment . In some c ases , the
person with a utism sp ectr um disorder might sho w highly res tricte d and fixa ted interes ts tha t app ear to b e
abnormal in their intensity . For ins tanc e, the p erson might le arn and memoriz e ev ery detail a bout something
even though doing so ser ves no app arent purp ose. Imp ortantly , autism sp ectr um disorder is not the same
thing as intellectual disa bility , although these tw o conditions are o ften c omorbid . The DSM-5 sp ecifies tha t the
symptoms o f autism sp ectr um disorder are not c aused or e xplaine d by intellectual disa bility .
Life Pr oblems Fr om A utism Spectrum Disor der
Autism sp ectr um disorder is ref erre d to in ev eryday langua ge as a utism; in fact , the disorder w as terme d
“autis tic disorder ” in e arlier e ditions o f the DSM, and its dia gnos tic criteria w ere much narro wer than those o f
autism sp ectr um disorder . The qualifier “ spectr um” in a utism sp ectr um disorder is use d to indic ate tha t
individuals with the disorder c an sho w a rang e, or sp ectr um, of symptoms tha t vary in their ma gnitude and
severity: some sev ere, others les s sev ere. The previous e dition o f the DSM include d a dia gnosis o f Asp erger’s
disorder , generally rec ogniz ed as a les s sev ere f orm o f autis tic disorder; individuals dia gnose d with Asp erger’s
disorder w ere describ ed as ha ving a verage or high intellig ence and a s trong v ocabular y, but e xhibiting
imp airments in so cial interaction and so cial c ommunic ation , such as talking only a bout their sp ecial interes ts
(Wing, Gould , & Gillb erg, 2011). Ho wever, because rese arch has faile d to demons trate tha tAsp erger’sdisorder

some p arents tha t their children ma y no long er b e eligible f or sp ecial ser vices (“ Asp erger’s Syndrome
Dropp ed,” 2012). Some individuals with a utism sp ectr um disorder , particularly those with b etter langua ge and
intellectual skills , can liv e and w ork indep endently as adults . Ho wever, mos t do not b ecause the s ymptoms

disorder is 4 times more c ommon among b oys (1 in 38) than in girls (1 in 152) (Baio et al , 2018). Ra tes o f
autis tic sp ectr um disorder ha ve incre ased drama tically sinc e the 1980s . For e xample , California sa w an
incre ase o f 273% in rep orted cases from 1987 through 1998 (B yrd, 2002); b etween 2000 and 2008, the ra te of
autism dia gnoses in the Unite d Sta tes incre ased 78% (CD C, 2012). A lthough it is difficult to interpret this
incre ase, it is p ossible tha t the rise in prev alenc e is the result o f the bro adening o f the dia gnosis , incre ased
efforts to identif y cases in the c ommunity , and gre ater a warenes s and ac ceptanc e of the dia gnosis . In addition ,
mental he alth pro fessionals are no w more kno wledgeable a bout a utism sp ectr um disorder and are b etter
equipp ed to mak e the dia gnosis , even in subtle c ases (N ovella, 2008).
Causes of A utism Spectrum Disor der
The e xact c auses o f autism sp ectr um disorder remain unkno wn despite mas sive rese arch eff orts over the las t
two dec ades (Meek , Lemer y-Chalfant , Jahromi , & V aliente , 2013). A utism app ears to b e strongly influenc ed by
genetics , as identic al twins sho w concordanc e ra tes o f 60%–90%, where as c oncordanc e ra tes f or fra ternal
twins and siblings are 5%–10% (A utism Genome P roject C onsor tium , 2007). Man y diff erent g enes and g ene
muta tions ha ve been implic ated in a utism (Meek et al ., 2013). Among the g enes in volved are those imp ortant
in the f orma tion o f synaptic circuits tha t facilita te communic ation b etween diff erent are as o f the brain
(Gauthier et al ., 2011). A numb er o f environmental factors are also thought to b e as sociated with incre ased
risk f or a utism sp ectr um disorder , at least in p art, because the y contribute to new muta tions . These factors
include e xposure to p ollutants , such as plant emis sions and mercur y, urb an v ersus r ural residenc e, and
vitamin D deficiency (Kinne y, Barch , Cha yka, N apoleon , & Munir , 2009).

Child V accinations and A utism Spectrum Disor der
In the la te 1990s , a pres tigious me dical journal publishe d an ar ticle purp ortedly sho wing tha t autism is
trigg ered by the MMR (me asles , mumps , and r ubella) v accine . These findings w ere v ery contro versial and drew
a gre at deal of attention , sparking an interna tional f orum on whether children should b e vaccina ted. In a
shocking turn o f events , some y ears la ter the ar ticle w as retracte d by the journal tha t had publishe d it a fter
evidenc e of fra ud and unethic al practic es on the p art of the le ad rese archer . Despite the retraction , the
reporting in p opular me dia le d to c oncerns a bout a p ossible link b etween v accines and a utism p ersis ting . A
recent sur vey of parents , for e xample , found tha t roughly a third o f resp ondents e xpres sed such a c oncern
(Kenne dy, LaVail, Nowak, Bask et, & Landr y, 2011); and p erhaps f earing tha t their children w ould dev elop
autism , more than 10% o f parents o f young children refuse or dela yvaccina tions (Dempse y et al ., 2011). Some
parents o f children with a utism mounte d a c amp aign a gains t scientis ts who refute d the v accine -autism link .
Even p oliticians and sev eral w ell-kno wn c elebrities w eighe d in; f or e xample , actres s Jenn y McC arthy (who
believ ed tha t a v accina tion c aused her son ’s autism) c o-authore d a b ook on the ma tter. Ho wever, there is no
scientific evidenc e tha t a link e xists between a utism and v accina tions (Hughes , 2007). Indee d, a rec ent s tudy
comp ared the v accina tion his tories o f 256 children with a utism sp ectr um disorder with tha t of 752 c ontrol
children acros s three time p erio ds during their firs t two years o f life (birth to 3 months , bir th to 7 months , and
birth to 2 y ears) (De Stefano , Price, & W eintra ub, 2013). A t the time o f the s tudy , the children w ere b etween 6
and 13 y ears old , and their prior v accina tion rec ords w ere obtaine d. Bec ause v accines c ontain immunog ens
(subs tanc es tha t fight inf ections), the in vestigators e xamine d me dical rec ords to see ho w man y immunog ens
children rec eived to determine if those children who rec eived more immunog ens w ere a t gre ater risk f or
developing a utism sp ectr um disorder . The results o f this s tudy , a p ortion o f which are sho wn in Figure 15.19 ,
clearly demons trate tha t the quantity o f immunog ens from v accines rec eived during the firs t two years o f life
were not a t all rela ted to the dev elopment o f autism sp ectr um disorder . There is not a rela tionship b etween
vaccina tions and a utism sp ectr um disorders .
FIGURE 15.19 In terms o f their e xposur e to immunog ens in v accines , overall, ther e is not a significant diff erence
betw een childr en with autism spectrum disor der and their ag e-mat ched c ontr ols without the disor der (De Stefano et
al., 2013).
Why do es c oncern o ver vaccines and a utism sp ectr um disorder p ersis t? Sinc e the prolif eration o f the Internet
in the 1990s , parents ha ve been c onstantly b omb arde d with online inf orma tion tha t can b ecome ma gnifie d

out o f 12 children—ac cording to their p arents —develop ed symptoms c onsis tent with a utism sp ectr um
disorder shor tly a fter rec eiving a v accina tion . To conclude tha t vaccines c ause a utism sp ectr um disorder on
this b asis , as man y did , is cle arly inc orrect f or a numb er o f reasons , not the le ast of which is b ecause
correla tion do es not imply c ausation , as y ou’ve learne d.
Additionally , as w as the c ase with diet and ADHD in the 1970s , the notion tha t autism sp ectr um disorder is
caused by vaccina tions is app ealing to some b ecause it pro vides a simple e xplana tion f or this c ondition . Lik e
all disorders , however, there are no simple e xplana tions f or a utism sp ectr um disorder . Although the rese arch

•Identif y the basic f eatur es o f bor derline personality disor der and antisocial personality disor der, and the fact ors
that ar e impor tant in the etiolog y of both
The term personality refers lo osely to one ’s stable, consis tent , and dis tinctiv e way of thinking a bout, feeling ,
acting , and rela ting to the w orld . People with personalit y disorders exhibit a p ersonality s tyle tha t diff ers
mark edly from the e xpecta tions o f their culture , is p ervasiv e and infle xible , begins in adolesc ence or e arly
adultho od, and c auses dis tres s or imp airment (AP A, 2013). Generally , individuals with these disorders e xhibit
enduring p ersonality s tyles tha t are e xtremely troubling and o ften cre ate problems f or them and those with
whom the y come into c ontact . Their maladaptiv e personality s tyles fre quently bring them into c onflict with
others , disr upt their a bility to dev elop and maintain so cial rela tionships , and prev ent them from
accomplishing re alistic lif e goals.
The DSM-5 rec ogniz es 10 p ersonality disorders , org aniz ed into 3 diff erent clus ters . Clus ter A disorders include
paranoid p ersonality disorder ,schiz oid p ersonality disorder , and schiz otyp al personality disorder . People with
these disorders displa y a p ersonality s tyle tha t is o dd or ec centric . Clus ter B disorders include antiso cial
personality disorder ,histrionic p ersonality disorder ,narcis sistic p ersonality disorder , and b orderline
personality disorder . People with these disorders usually are impulsiv e, overly drama tic, highly emotional , and
erra tic. Clus ter C disorders include avoidant p ersonality disorder ,dep endent p ersonality disorder , and
obses sive-compulsiv e personality disorder (which is not the same thing as obses sive-compulsiv e disorder).
People with these disorders o ften app ear to b e ner vous and f earful.Table 15.2 provides a description o f each

personality disorders the mos t fre quent (Le zenweger, Lane , Lorang er, & K essler, 2007). Tw o of these
personality disorders , borderline p ersonality disorder and antiso cial p ersonality disorder , are reg arde d by
man y as esp ecially problema tic.
Bor derline P ersonality Disor der
The “b orderline ” in b orderline p ersonality disorder w as originally c oine d in the la te 1930s in an eff ort to
describ e patients who app eared anxious , but w ere prone to brief ps ychotic e xperienc es—tha t is, patients who
were thought to b e literally on the b orderline b etween anxiety and ps ychosis (F reeman , Stone , Mar tin, &
Reineck e, 2005). T oday,borderline p ersonalit y disorder has a c ompletely diff erent me aning . Borderline
personality disorder is characteriz ed chiefly b y ins tability in interp ersonal rela tionships , self -ima ge, and
mood, as w ell as mark ed impulsivity (AP A, 2013). P eople with b orderline p ersonality disorder c annot tolera te
the thought o f being alone and will mak e frantic eff orts (including making suicidal g estures and eng aging in
self-mutila tion) to a void a bandonment or sep aration ( whether re al or ima gine d). Their rela tionships are
intense and uns table; f or e xample , a romantic p artner ma y be ide alized early in a rela tionship , but then la ter
vilifie d at the slightes t sign the y app ear to no long er sho w interes t. These individuals ha ve an uns table view o f
self and , thus , might suddenly displa y a shift in p ersonal a ttitudes , interes ts, career plans , and choic e of
friends . For e xample , a la w scho ol student ma y, despite ha ving in vested tens o f thousands o f dollars to ward
earning a la w degree and despite ha ving p erforme d well in the program , consider dropping out and pursuing a
career in another field . People with b orderline p ersonality disorder ma y be highly impulsiv e and ma y eng age
in reckles s and self -des tructiv e behaviors such as e xcessive gambling , spending mone y irresp onsibly ,
subs tanc e abuse , eng aging in unsa fe se x, and reckles s driving . The y sometimes sho w intense and
inappropria te ang er tha t the y ha ve difficulty c ontrolling , and the y can b e mo ody, sarc astic, bit ter, and v erbally
abusiv e.
The prev alenc e of borderline p ersonality disorder in the U .S. p opula tion is es tima ted to b e around 1.4%
(Lezenweger et al ., 2007), but the ra tes are higher among those who use mental he alth ser vices; appro xima tely
10% o f mental he alth outp atients and 20% o f psychia tric inp atients meet the criteria f or dia gnosis (AP A,
2013). A dditionally , borderline p ersonality disorder is c omorbid with anxiety , mo od, and subs tanc e use
disorders (Le zenweger et al ., 2007).
Biological Basis f or Bor derline P ersonality Disor der
Genetic factors app ear to b e imp ortant in the dev elopment o f borderline p ersonality disorder . For e xample ,
core p ersonality traits tha t characteriz e this disorder , such as impulsivity and emotional ins tability , sho w a
high degree o f herita bility (Liv esle y, 2008). A lso, the ra tes o f borderline p ersonality disorder among rela tives o f
people with this disorder ha ve been f ound to b e as high as 24.9% ( White , Gunderson , Zanarani , & Hudson ,
2003). Individuals with b orderline p ersonality disorder rep ort experiencing childho od ph ysical, sexual , and/or
emotional a buse a t rates far gre ater than those obser ved in the g eneral p opula tion (Afifi et al ., 2010), indic ating
that en vironmental factors are also cr ucial . These findings w ould sugg est tha t borderline p ersonality disorder
may be determine d by an interaction b etween g enetic factors and adv erse en vironmental e xperienc es.
Consis tent with this h ypothesis , one s tudy f ound tha t the highes t rates o f borderline p ersonality disorder w ere
among individuals with a b orderline temp erament (characteriz ed by high no velty seeking and high harm-
avoidanc e) and those who e xperienc ed childho od abuse and/or neglect (J oyce et al ., 2003).
Antisocial P ersonality Disor der
Mos t human b eings liv e in ac cordanc e with a moral c omp ass, a sense o f right and wrong . Mos t individuals
learn a t a v ery young a ge tha t there are c ertain things tha t should not b e done . We learn tha t we should not lie
or che at. We are ta ught tha t it is wrong to tak e things tha t do not b elong to us , and tha t it is wrong to e xploit
others f or p ersonal g ain. We also le arn the imp ortanc e of living up to our resp onsibilities , of doing wha t we sa y
we will do . People with antiso cial p ersonality disorder , however, do not seem to ha ve a moral c omp ass. These
individuals act as though the y neither ha ve a sense o f nor c are a bout right or wrong . Not surprisingly , these584 15 • P sychological Disor ders

people represent a serious problem f or others and f or so ciety in g eneral .
According to the DSM-5, the individual with antisocial p ersonalit y disorder shows no reg ard a t all f or other
people ’s rights or f eelings . This lack o f reg ard is e xhibite d a numb er o f ways and c an include rep eatedly
performing illeg al acts , lying to or c onning others , impulsivity and reckles snes s, irrita bility and a ggres sivenes s
toward others , and failure to act in a resp onsible w ay (e.g., leaving debts unp aid) (AP A, 2013). P eople with this
disorder ha ve no remorse o ver their misdee ds; these p eople will hur t, manipula te, exploit , and a buse others
and not f eel an y guilt . Signs o f this disorder c an emerg e early in lif e; ho wever, a p erson mus t be at least 18
years old to b e dia gnose d with antiso cial p ersonality disorder .
People with antiso cial p ersonality disorder seem to view the w orld as self -ser ving and unkind . The y seem to
think tha t the y should use wha tever me ans nec essary to g et by in lif e. The y tend to view others not as living ,
thinking , feeling b eings , but ra ther as p awns to b e use d or a buse d for a sp ecific purp ose. The y often ha ve an
over-infla ted sense o f themselv es and c an app ear e xtremely arrog ant. The y fre quently displa y sup erficial
charm; f or e xample , without re ally me aning it the y might sa y exactly wha t the y think another p erson w ants to
hear. The y lack emp athy: the y are inc apable o f unders tanding the emotional p oint -of-view o f others . People
with this disorder ma y become in volved in illeg al enterprises , sho w cr uelty to ward others , leave their jobs with
no plans to obtain another job , have multiple se xual p artners , rep eatedly g et into fights with others , and sho w
reckles s disreg ard f or themselv es and others (e .g., rep eated arres ts for driving while into xicated) (AP A, 2013).
The DSM-5 has include d an alterna tive mo del f or c onceptualizing p ersonality disorders b ased on the traits
identifie d in the F ive Factor Mo del o f personality . This mo del addres ses the lev el of personality functioning
such as imp airments in self (identity or self -direction) and interp ersonal (emp athy or intimacy ) functioning . In
the c ase o f antiso cial p ersonality disorder , the DSM-5 identifies the pre dominant traits o f anta gonism (such as
disreg ard f or others’ nee ds, manipula tive or dec eitful b ehavior) and disinhibition (characteriz ed by
impulsivity , irresp onsibility , and risk -taking ) (Har wood, Schade , Krueger, Wright , & Mark on, 2012). A
psychop atholog y sp ecifier is also include d tha t emphasiz es traits such as a ttention seeking and lo w
anxiousnes s (lack o f concern a bout neg ative conse quenc es for risky or harmful b ehavior) (C rego & W idig er,
2014).
Risk F actors f or Antisocial P ersonality Disor der
Antiso cial p ersonality disorder is obser ved in a bout 3.6% o f the p opula tion; the disorder is much more
common among men , with a 3 to 1 ra tio o f men to w omen , and it is more lik ely to o ccur in men who are
young er, wido wed, sep arated, div orced, of lower so cioeconomic s tatus, who liv e in urb an are as, and who liv e in
the w estern Unite d Sta tes (C ompton , Conway, Stinson , Colliv er, & Grant , 2005). C omp ared to men with
antiso cial p ersonality disorder , women with the disorder are more lik ely to ha ve experienc ed emotional
neglect and se xual a buse during childho od, and the y are more lik ely to ha ve had p arents who a buse d
subs tanc es and who eng aged in antiso cial b ehaviors themselv es (A legria et al ., 2013).

Family , twin , and adoption s tudies sugg est tha t both g enetic and en vironmental factors influenc e the
development o f antiso cial p ersonality disorder , as w ell as g eneral antiso cial b ehavior (criminality , violenc e,
aggres sivenes s) (Bak er, Bezdjian , & Raine , 2006). P ersonality and temp erament dimensions tha t are rela ted to
this disorder , including f earles snes s, impulsiv e antiso ciality , and c allousnes s, have a subs tantial g enetic
influenc e (Liv esle y & J ang , 2008). A doption s tudies cle arly demons trate tha t the dev elopment o f antiso cial
behavior is determine d by the interaction o f genetic factors and adv erse en vironmental circums tanc es (Rhee &
Waldman , 2002). F or e xample , one in vestigation f ound tha t adoptees o f biologic al parents with antiso cial
personality disorder w ere more lik ely to e xhibit adolesc ent and adult antiso cial b ehaviors if the y were raise d
in adv erse adoptiv e family en vironments (e .g., adoptiv e parents had marital problems , were div orced, use d
drugs, and had leg al problems) than if the y were raise d in a more normal adoptiv e en vironment (C adoret ,
Yates, Ed, Woodworth, & Stew art, 1995).
Researchers who are interes ted in the imp ortanc e of environment in the dev elopment o f antiso cial p ersonality
disorder ha ve directe d their a ttention to such factors as the c ommunity , the s tructure and functioning o f the
family , and p eer groups . Each o f these factors influenc es the lik eliho od of antiso cial b ehavior . One longitudinal
investigation o f more than 800 Se attle-are a youth me asure d risk factors f or violenc e at 10, 14, 16, and 18 y ears
of age (Herrenk ohl et al ., 2000). The risk factors e xamine d include d those in volving the family , peers , and
community . A p ortion o f the findings from this s tudy are pro vide d in Figure 15.20 .586 15 • P sychological Disor ders

Those with antiso cial tendencies do not seem to e xperienc e emotions the w ay mos t other p eople do . These
individuals fail to sho w fear in resp onse to en vironment cues tha t signal punishment , pain, or no xious
stimula tion . For ins tanc e, the y sho w les s skin c onductanc e (sweatines s on hands) in anticip ation o f electric
shock than do p eople without antiso cial tendencies (Hare , 1965). Skin c onductanc e is c ontrolle d by the
symp athetic ner vous s ystem and is use d to as sess autonomic ner vous s ystem functioning . When the
symp athetic ner vous s ystem is activ e, people b ecome arouse d and anxious , and s weat gland activity incre ases .
Thus , incre ased sweat gland activity , as as sessed through skin c onductanc e, is tak en as a sign o f arousal or
anxiety . For those with antiso cial p ersonality disorder , a lack o f skin c onductanc e ma y indic ate the presenc e of
characteris tics such as emotional deficits and impulsivity tha t underlie the prop ensity f or antiso cial b ehavior
and neg ative so cial rela tionships (F ung et al ., 2005).
Another e xample sho wing tha t those with antiso cial p ersonality disorder fail to resp ond to en vironmental cues
comes from a rec ent s tudy b y Stupp y-Sulliv an and Baskin-Sommers (2019). The rese archers s tudie d cognitiv e

Summary
15.1 What Ar e Psychological Disor ders?
Psychologic al disorders are c onditions characteriz ed by abnormal thoughts , feelings , and b ehaviors . Although
challenging , it is es sential f or ps ychologis ts and mental he alth pro fessionals to a gree on wha t kinds o f inner
experienc es and b ehaviors c onstitute the presenc e of a ps ychologic al disorder . Inner e xperienc es and
behaviors tha t are a typic al or viola te so cial norms c ould signif y the presenc e of a disorder; ho wever, each o f
these criteria alone is inade qua te. Harmful dy sfunction describ es the view tha t psychologic al disorders result
from the ina bility o f an internal mechanism to p erform its na tural function . Man y of the f eatures o f harmful
dysfunction c onceptualiza tion ha ve been inc orporated in the AP A’s formal definition o f psychologic al
disorders . According to this definition , the presenc e of a ps ychologic al disorder is signale d by signific ant
disturb ances in thoughts , feelings , and b ehaviors; these dis turb ances mus t reflect some kind o f dysfunction
(biologic al, psychologic al, or dev elopmental), mus t cause signific ant imp airment in one ’s life, and mus t not
reflect culturally e xpecte d re actions to c ertain lif e ev ents .
15.2 Diagnosing and Classifying Psychological Disor ders
The dia gnosis and clas sific ation o f psychologic al disorders is es sential in s tudying and tre ating
psychop atholog y. The clas sific ation s ystem use d by mos t U.S. pro fessionals is the DSM-5. The firs t edition o f
the DSM w as publishe d in 1952, and has underg one numerous revisions . The 5th and mos t rec ent e dition , the
DSM-5, w as publishe d in 2013. The dia gnos tic manual includes a total o f 237 sp ecific dia gnosa ble disorders ,
each describ ed in detail , including its s ymptoms , prev alenc e, risk factors , and c omorbidity . Over time , the
numb er o f dia gnosa ble c onditions lis ted in the DSM has gro wn s teadily , prompting criticism from some .
Nevertheles s, the dia gnos tic criteria in the DSM are more e xplicit than tha t of an y other s ystem , which mak es
the DSM s ystem highly desira ble f or b oth clinic al dia gnosis and rese arch .15 • Summar y591
15.3 Perspectives on Psychological Disor ders
Psychop atholog y is v ery comple x, involving a plethora o f etiologic al theories and p ersp ectiv es. For c enturies ,
psychologic al disorders w ere view ed primarily from a sup erna tural p ersp ectiv e and thought to arise from
divine f orces or p ossession from spirits . Some cultures c ontinue to hold this sup erna tural b elief. T oday, man y
who s tudy ps ychop atholog y view mental illnes s from a biologic al persp ectiv e, whereb y ps ychologic al disorders
are thought to result larg ely from fa ulty biologic al pro cesses. Indee d, scientific adv ances o ver the las t sev eral
decades ha ve pro vide d a b etter unders tanding o f the g enetic , neurologic al, hormonal , and bio chemic al bases
of psychop atholog y. The ps ychologic al persp ectiv e, in c ontras t, emphasiz es the imp ortanc e of psychologic al
factors (e .g., stres s and thoughts) and en vironmental factors in the dev elopment o f psychologic al disorders . A
contemp orar y, promising appro ach is to view disorders as origina ting from an integra tion o f biologic al and
psychoso cial factors . The dia thesis -stres s mo del sugg ests tha t people with an underlying dia thesis , or
vulnera bility , for a ps ychologic al disorder are more lik ely than those without the dia thesis to dev elop the
disorder when fac ed with s tres sful ev ents .
15.4 Anxiety Disor ders
Anxiety disorders are a group o f disorders in which a p erson e xperienc es e xcessive, persis tent , and dis tres sing
fear and anxiety tha t inter feres with normal functioning . Anxiety disorders include sp ecific phobia: a sp ecific
unre alistic f ear; so cial anxiety disorder: e xtreme f ear and a voidanc e of social situa tions; p anic disorder:
suddenly o verwhelme d by panic ev en though there is no app arent re ason to b e frightene d; agoraphobia: an
intense f ear and a voidanc e of situa tions in which it might b e difficult to esc ape; and g eneraliz ed anxiety
disorder: a rela tively c ontinuous s tate of tension , apprehension , and dre ad.
15.5 Obsessive-Compulsive and R elated Disor ders
Obses sive-compulsiv e and rela ted disorders are a group o f DSM-5 disorders tha t overlap somewha t in tha t
they each in volve intr usiv e thoughts and/or rep etitiv e behaviors . Perhaps the mos t rec ogniz ed of these
disorders is obses sive-compulsiv e disorder , in which a p erson is obses sed with un wante d, unple asant
thoughts and/or c ompulsiv ely eng ages in rep etitiv e behaviors or mental acts , perhaps as a w ay of coping with
the obses sions . Bo dy dy smorphic disorder is characteriz ed by the individual b ecoming e xcessively
preo ccupie d with one or more p erceived fla ws in their ph ysical app earanc e tha t are either none xistent or
unnotic eable to others . Preoccup ation with the p erceived ph ysical def ects c auses the p erson to e xperienc e
signific ant anxiety reg arding ho w the y app ear to others . Ho arding disorder is characteriz ed by persis tent
difficulty in disc arding or p arting with objects , reg ardles s of their actual v alue , often resulting in the
accumula tion o f items tha t clut ter and c ong est their living are a.
15.6 Posttr aumatic Str ess Disor der
Posttrauma tic s tres s disorder (PT SD) w as describ ed through much o f the 20th c entur y and w as ref erre d to as
shell sho ck and c omb at neurosis in the b elief tha t its s ymptoms w ere thought to emerg e from the s tres s of
activ e comb at. Today, PT SD is define d as a disorder in which the e xperienc e of a tra uma tic or pro foundly
stres sful ev ent, such as c omb at, sexual as sault, or na tural disas ter, pro duces a c onstella tion o f symptoms tha t
mus t las t for one month or more . These s ymptoms include intr usiv e and dis tres sing memories o f the ev ent,
flashb acks , avoidanc e of stimuli or situa tions tha t are c onnecte d to the ev ent, persis tently neg ative emotional
states, feeling detache d from others , irrita bility , pronenes s toward outburs ts, and a tendency to b e easily
startled. Not ev eryone who e xperienc es a tra uma tic ev ent will dev elop PT SD; a v ariety o f risk factors
associated with its dev elopment ha ve been identifie d.
15.7 Mood and R elated Disor ders
Mood disorders are those in which the p erson e xperienc es sev ere dis turb ances in mo od and emotion . The y
include depres sive disorders and bip olar and rela ted disorders . Depres sive disorders include major
depres sive disorder , which is characteriz ed by episo des o f pro found sadnes s and los s of interes t or ple asure in592 15 • Summar y

usual activities and other as sociated features , and p ersis tent depres sive disorder , which mark ed by a chronic
state of sadnes s.
Bipolar disorder is characteriz ed by mo od states tha t vacilla te between sadnes s and euphoria; a dia gnosis o f
bipolar disorder re quires e xperiencing a t least one manic episo de, which is define d as a p erio d of extreme
euphoria, irrita bility , and incre ased activity . During a manic episo de, a p erson will lik ely e xhibit b ehaviors
atypic al for tha t person . The y ma y become e xcessively talka tive, exhibit flight o f ide as, and mak e grandiose
plans . The y ma y go on a sp ending spree , maxing out their cre dit c ard with items the y can not a fford, gamble ,
or eng age in risky se xual b ehaviors . Ab out fifty p ercent o f people suff ering from bip olar disorder do not
receive tre atment . Bip olar disorder is a definitiv e risk factor f or suicide , with a bout a third o f people with
bipolar disorder a ttempting suicide .
When a p erson 's pain and dis tres s completely o verwhelm their a bility to c ope, some p eople ma y consider
suicide . People who suff er from mental he alth and subs tanc e abuse problems are a t a much higher risk o f
suicide than the g eneral public . Males die b y suicide a t a signific antly higher ra te than f emales , and males use
much more lethal me ans in their a ttempts . A p erson c ontempla ting suicide nee ds help and should not ha ve
access to lethal me ans o f suicide , such as fire arms . If y ou or someone y ou kno w is c ontempla ting suicide , there
are man y helpful resourc es. Three o f them are lis ted below:

15.8 Schiz ophr enia
Schiz ophrenia is a sev ere disorder characteriz ed by a c omplete bre akdown in one ’s ability to function in lif e; it
often re quires hospitaliza tion . People with schiz ophrenia e xperienc e hallucina tions and delusions , and the y
have extreme difficulty regula ting their emotions and b ehavior . Thinking is inc oherent and disorg aniz ed,
behavior is e xtremely bizarre , emotions are fla t, and motiv ation to eng age in mos t basic lif e activities is
lacking . Considera ble evidenc e sho ws tha t genetic factors pla y a c entral role in schiz ophrenia; ho wever,
adoption s tudies ha ve highlighte d the additional imp ortanc e of environmental factors . Neurotransmit ter and
brain a bnormalities , which ma y be link ed to en vironmental factors such as obs tetric c omplic ations or
exposure to influenza during the g estational p erio d, have also b een implic ated. A promising new are a of

inter vention .
15.9 Dissociative Disor ders
The main characteris tic o f dis sociative disorders is tha t people b ecome dis sociated from their sense o f self,
resulting in memor y and identity dis turb ances. Dis sociative disorders lis ted in the DSM-5 include dis sociative
amnesia, dep ersonaliza tion/dere aliza tion disorder , and dis sociative identity disorder . A p erson with
dissociative amnesia is una ble to rec all imp ortant p ersonal inf orma tion , often a fter a s tres sful or tra uma tic
experienc e.
Dep ersonaliza tion/dere aliza tion disorder is characteriz ed by recurring episo des o f dep ersonaliza tion (i .e.,
detachment from or unfamiliarity with the self ) and/or dere aliza tion (i .e., detachment from or unfamiliarity
with the w orld). A p erson with dis sociative identity disorder e xhibits tw o or more w ell-define d and dis tinct
personalities or identities , as w ell as memor y gaps f or the time during which another identity w as present .
Dissociative identity disorder has g enera ted contro versy, mainly b ecause some b eliev e its s ymptoms c an b e15 • Summar y593
faked by patients if presenting its s ymptoms someho w benefits the p atient in a voiding neg ative conse quenc es
or taking resp onsibility f or one ’s actions . The dia gnos tic ra tes o f this disorder ha ve incre ased drama tically
following its p ortrayal in p opular culture . Ho wever, man y people legitima tely suff er o ver the c ourse o f a
lifetime with this disorder .
15.10 Disor ders in Childhood
Neuro developmental disorders are a group o f disorders tha t are typic ally dia gnose d during childho od and are
characteriz ed by dev elopmental deficits in p ersonal , social, academic , and intellectual re alms; these disorders
include a ttention deficit /hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and a utism sp ectr um disorder . ADHD is characteriz ed
by a p ervasiv e pattern o f ina ttention and/or h yperactiv e and impulsiv e behavior tha t inter feres with normal
functioning . Genetic and neurobiologic al factors c ontribute to the dev elopment o f ADHD , which c an p ersis t
well into adultho od and is o ften as sociated with p oor long-term outc omes . The major f eatures o f autism
spectr um disorder include deficits in so cial interaction and c ommunic ation and rep etitiv e mo vements or
interes ts. As with ADHD , genetic factors app ear to pla y a prominent role in the dev elopment o f autism
spectr um disorder; e xposure to en vironmental p ollutants such as mercur y ha ve also b een link ed to the
development o f this disorder . Although it is b eliev ed by some tha t autism is trigg ered by the MMR v accina tion ,
evidenc e do es not supp ort this claim .
15.11 Personality Disor ders
Individuals with p ersonality disorders e xhibit a p ersonality s tyle tha t is infle xible , causes dis tres s and
imp airment , and cre ates problems f or themselv es and others . The DSM-5 rec ogniz es 10 p ersonality disorders ,
organiz ed into three clus ters . The disorders in Clus ter A include those characteriz ed by a p ersonality s tyle tha t
is odd and ec centric . Clus ter B includes p ersonality disorders characteriz ed chiefly b y a p ersonality s tyle tha t
is impulsiv e, drama tic, highly emotional , and erra tic, and those in Clus ter C are characteriz ed by a ner vous
and f earful p ersonality s tyle. Tw o Clus ter B p ersonality disorders , borderline p ersonality disorder and
antiso cial p ersonality disorder , are esp ecially problema tic. People with b orderline p ersonality disorder sho w
mark ed ins tability in mo od, behavior , and self -ima ge, as w ell as impulsivity . The y cannot s tand to b e alone , are
unpre dicta ble, have a his tory of storm y rela tionships , and fre quently displa y intense and inappropria te ang er.
Genetic factors and adv erse childho od experienc es (e .g., se xual a buse) app ear to b e imp ortant in its
development . People with antiso cial p ersonality displa y a lack o f reg ard f or the rights o f others; the y are
impulsiv e, dec eitful , irresp onsible , and unburdene d by an y sense o f guilt . Genetic factors and so cializa tion
both app ear to b e imp ortant in the origin o f antiso cial p ersonality disorder . Research has also sho wn tha t those
with this disorder do not e xperienc e emotions the w ay mos t other p eople do .

Before w e explore the v arious appro aches to therap y use d to day, let’s begin our s tudy o f therap y by looking a t
how man y people e xperienc e mental illnes s and ho w man y rec eive tre atment . According to the U .S.

Considering the man y forms o f tre atment f or mental he alth disorders a vailable to day, how did these f orms o f

ques tiona ble appro aches in light o f mo dern unders tanding o f mental illnes s) to where w e are to day.
Treatment in the P ast
For much o f his tory, people with mental illnes s ha ve been tre ated very poorly . It w as b eliev ed tha t mental
illnes s was c aused by demonic p ossession , witchcra ft, or an angr y god (S zasz, 1960). F or e xample , in me diev al
times , abnormal b ehaviors w ere view ed as a sign tha t a p erson w as p ossessed by demons . If someone w as
considere d to b e possessed, there w ere sev eral f orms o f tre atment to rele ase spirits from the individual . The
mos t common tre atment w as e xorcism , often c onducte d by pries ts or other religious figures: Inc anta tions and
prayers w ere said o ver the p erson ’s body, and the y ma y ha ve been giv en some me dicinal drinks . Another f orm
of tre atment f or e xtreme c ases o f mental illnes s was trephining: A small hole w as made in the a fflicte d
individual ’s sk ull to rele ase spirits from the b ody. Mos t people tre ated in this manner die d. In addition to
exorcism and trephining , other practic es in volved execution or imprisonment o f people with ps ychologic al
disorders . Still others w ere left to b e homeles s beggars. Generally sp eaking , mos t people who e xhibite d strang e
behaviors w ere gre atly misunders tood and tre ated cr uelly . The prev ailing theor y of psychop atholog y in e arlier
history was the ide a tha t mental illnes s was the result o f demonic p ossession b y either an evil spirit or an evil
god because e arly b eliefs inc orrectly a ttribute d all une xplaina ble phenomena to deities deeme d either g ood or
evil.
From the la te 1400s to the la te 1600s , a c ommon b elief p erpetua ted by some religious org aniza tions w as tha t
some p eople made p acts with the devil and c ommit ted horrible acts , such as e ating b abies (Blumb erg, 2007).
These p eople w ere c onsidere d to b e witches and w ere trie d and c ondemne d by courts—the y were o ften burne d
at the s take. Worldwide , it is es tima ted tha t tens o f thousands o f mentally ill p eople w ere kille d after b eing
accuse d of being witches or under the influenc e of witchcra ft (Hemphill , 1966)
By the 18th c entur y, people who w ere c onsidere d odd and unusual w ere plac ed in as ylums ( Figure 16.4 ).
Asylums were the firs t ins titutions cre ated for the sp ecific purp ose o f housing p eople with ps ychologic al
disorders , but the f ocus w as os tracizing them from so ciety ra ther than tre ating their disorders . Often these
people w ere k ept in windo wles s dung eons , beaten, chaine d to their b eds, and had lit tle to no c ontact with
caregiv ers.16.1 • Mental Heal th Treatment: P ast and P resent 601

started the pro cess ofdeins titutionalizat ion, the closing o f larg e as ylums , by pro viding f or p eople to s tay in
their c ommunities and b e tre ated locally. In 1955, there w ere 558,239 sev erely mentally ill p atients
institutionaliz ed at public hospitals ( Torre y, 1997). B y 1994, b y percenta ge of the p opula tion , there w ere 92%

Mental Health T reatment T oday
Today, there are c ommunity mental he alth c enters acros s the na tion . The y are lo cated in neighb orho ods ne ar

Mental he alth is sues are also signific ant c oncerns reg arding those in volved in the c orrections s ystem .
According to a 2006 sp ecial rep ort by the B ureau of Justice Sta tistics (B JS), appro xima tely 705,600 adults with
mental he alth is sues w ere inc arcerated in the s tate prison s ystem , and another 78,800 w ere inc arcerated in
the f ederal prison s ystem . A fur ther 479,000 w ere in lo cal jails . According to the s tudy , “people with mental
illnes ses are o verrepresente d in prob ation and p arole p opula tions a t estima ted ra tes ranging from tw o to f our
times the g eneral p opula tion ” (Prins & Drap er, 2009, p . 23). The c orrectional s ystem fac es incre asing burdens
in mana ging and supp orting p eople with mental he alth is sues ( Torre y et al ., 2014). The inc arceration
experienc e itself e xacerbates e xisting is sues , trigg ers dis turb ances, or le ads to long term eff ects such as PT SD,
depres sion , or other disorders . While inc arcerated, people are o ften subjecte d to or witnes s violenc e or se xual
assault, fac e isola tion from family , and endure other ph ysical or emotional tra umas (E dgemon & Cla y-Warner ,
2019).
Today, ins tead o f asylums , there are ps ychia tric hospitals r un b y state governments and lo cal community
hospitals f ocuse d on shor t-term c are. In all typ es o f hospitals , the emphasis is on shor t-term s tays, with the
average length o f stay being les s than tw o weeks and o ften only sev eral da ys. This is p artly due to the v ery high
cost of psychia tric hospitaliza tion , which c an b e about $800 to $1000 p er night (Stensland , Watson , & Grazier ,
2012). Theref ore, insuranc e coverage often limits the length o f time a p erson c an b e hospitaliz ed for
treatment . Usually individuals are hospitaliz ed only if the y are an imminent thre at to themselv es or others .

Mos t people who ha ve mental illnes ses are not hospitaliz ed. If someone is f eeling v ery depres sed, complains o f

A rang e of funding sourc es p ay for mental he alth tre atment: he alth insuranc e, government , and priv ate p ay. In
the p ast, even when p eople had he alth insuranc e, the c overage would not alw ays pay for mental he alth
services. This chang ed with the Mental He alth P arity and A ddiction E quity A ct of 2008, which re quires group

Psychother apy T echniques: Psychoanalysis
Psychoanaly sis w as dev elop ed by Sigmund Freud and w as the firs t form o f psychotherap y. It w as the dominant
therap eutic technique in the e arly 20th c entur y, but it has sinc e waned signific antly in p opularity . Freud
believ ed mos t of our ps ychologic al problems are the result o f repres sed impulses and tra uma e xperienc ed in
childho od, and he b eliev ed ps ychoanaly sis w ould help unc over long-burie d feelings . In a ps ychoanaly st’s
office, you might see a p atient lying on a c ouch sp eaking o f dre ams or childho od memories , and the therapis t
using v arious F reudian metho ds such as free as sociation and dre am analy sis ( Figure 16.9 ). In free
associat ion, the p atient relax es and then sa ys wha tever comes to mind a t the moment . Ho wever, Freud f elt
that the eg o would a t times tr y to blo ck, or repres s, unac cepta ble urg es or p ainful c onflicts during free
association . Conse quently , a p atient w ould demons trate resis tanc e to rec alling these thoughts or situa tions . In
dream analy sis, a therapis t interprets the underlying me aning o f dre ams .
Psychoanaly sis is a therap y appro ach tha t typic ally tak es y ears. Over the c ourse o f time , the p atient rev eals a
great deal about himself to the therapis t. Freud sugg ested tha t during this p atient -therapis t rela tionship , the
patient c omes to dev elop s trong f eelings f or the therapis t—ma ybe positiv e feelings , ma ybe neg ative feelings .
Freud c alled this trans ferenc e: the p atient trans fers all the p ositiv e or neg ative emotions as sociated with the
patient ’s other rela tionships to the ps ychoanaly st. For e xample , Crystal is seeing a ps ychoanaly st. During the
years o f therap y, she c omes to see her therapis t as a fa ther figure . She trans fers her f eelings a bout her fa ther
onto her therapis t, perhaps in an eff ort to g ain the lo ve and a ttention she did not rec eive from her o wn fa ther .16.2 • T ypes o f Treatment 607

Psychother apy : Play Ther apy
Play therap yis often use d with children sinc e the y are not lik ely to sit on a c ouch and rec all their dre ams or
engage in traditional talk therap y. This technique uses a therap eutic pro cess of pla y to “help clients prev ent or
resolv e ps ychoso cial difficulties and achiev e optimal gro wth” (O’Connor , 2000, p . 7). The ide a is tha t children
play out their hop es, fantasies , and tra umas while using dolls , stuffed animals , and sandb ox figurines ( Figure
16.10 ). Pla y therap y can also b e use d to help a therapis t mak e a dia gnosis . The therapis t obser ves ho w the
child interacts with to ys (e.g., dolls , animals , and home set tings) in an eff ort to unders tand the ro ots o f the
child ’s dis turb ed behavior . Pla y therap y can b e nondirectiv e or directiv e. In nondirectiv e pla y therap y, children
are enc oura ged to w ork through their problems b y pla ying freely while the therapis t obser ves (LeBlanc &
Ritchie , 2001). In directiv e pla y therap y, the therapis t pro vides more s tructure and guidanc e in the pla y
session b y sugg esting topics , asking ques tions , and ev en pla ying with the child (Har ter, 1977).

Psychother apy : Behavior Ther apy
Inpsycho analy sis, therapis ts help their p atients lo ok into their p ast to unc over repres sed feelings . In
beha vior therap y, a therapis t emplo ys principles o f learning to help clients chang e undesira ble
behaviors —ra ther than digging deeply into one ’s unc onscious . Therapis ts with this orienta tion b eliev e tha t

dysfunctional b ehaviors , like phobias and b edwetting , can b e chang ed by teaching clients new , more
constructiv e behaviors . Beha vior therap y emplo ys both clas sical and op erant c onditioning techniques to
chang e behavior .
One typ e of behavior therap y utiliz es clas sical conditioning techniques . Therapis ts using these techniques
believ e tha t dysfunctional b ehaviors are c onditione d resp onses . Applying the c onditioning principles
develop ed by Ivan P avlov, these therapis ts seek to rec ondition their clients and thus chang e their b ehavior .
Emmie is eight y ears old , and fre quently w ets her b ed at night . She ’s been in vite d to sev eral sleep overs, but she
won’t go because o f her problem . Using a typ e of conditioning therap y, Emmie b egins to sleep on a liquid-
sensitiv e bed pad tha t is ho oked to an alarm . When mois ture touches the p ad, it sets o ff the alarm , waking up
Emmie . When this pro cess is rep eated enough times , Emmie dev elops an as sociation b etween urinar y
relaxa tion and w aking up , and this s tops the b edwetting . Emmie has no w gone three w eeks without w etting her
bed and is lo oking f orward to her firs t sleep over this w eekend .
One c ommonly use d clas sical conditioning therap eutic technique is counterc ondit ioning : a client le arns a
new resp onse to a s timulus tha t has previously elicite d an undesira ble b ehavior . Tw o counterc onditioning
techniques are a versiv e conditioning and e xposure therap y.Aversiv e condit ioning uses an unple asant
stimulus to s top an undesira ble b ehavior . Therapis ts apply this technique to elimina te addictiv e behaviors ,
such as smoking , nail biting , and drinking . In a version therap y, clients will typic ally eng age in a sp ecific
behavior (such as nail biting ) and a t the same time are e xposed to something unple asant , such as a mild
electric sho ck or a b ad tas te. After rep eated as sociations b etween the unple asant s timulus and the b ehavior ,
the client c an le arn to s top the un wante d behavior .
Aversion therap y has b een use d eff ectiv ely f or y ears in the tre atment o f alc oholism (Da vidson , 1974; Elkins ,
1991; Streeton & Whelan , 2001). One c ommon w ay this o ccurs is through a chemic ally b ased subs tanc e kno wn
as Anta buse . When a p erson tak es Anta buse and then c onsumes alc ohol , unc omf ortable side eff ects result
including na usea, vomiting , incre ased he art rate, heart palpita tions , sev ere he adache , and shor tnes s of bre ath.
Anta buse is rep eatedly p aire d with alc ohol until the client as sociates alc ohol with unple asant f eelings , which
decre ases the client ’s desire to c onsume alc ohol . Anta buse cre ates a c onditione d aversion to alc ohol b ecause it
replac es the original ple asure resp onse with an unple asant one .
Inexposure therap y, a therapis t seeks to tre at clients’ f ears or anxiety b y presenting them with the object or
situa tion tha t causes their problem , with the ide a tha t the y will ev entually g et use d to it . This c an b e done via
reality , ima gina tion , or vir tual re ality . Exp osure therap y was firs t rep orted in 1924 b y Mar y Cover Jones , who is
considere d the mother o f behavior therap y. Jones w orked with a b oy name d Peter who w as a fraid o f rabbits .
Her g oal w as to replac e Peter ’s fear o f rabbits with a c onditione d resp onse o f relaxa tion , which is a resp onse
that is inc omp atible with f ear (Figure 16.11 ). Ho w did she do it? J ones b egan b y placing a c aged ra bbit on the
other side o f a ro om with P eter while he a te his a fterno on snack . Over the c ourse o f sev eral da ys, Jones mo ved
the ra bbit closer and closer to where P eter w as se ated with his snack . After tw o months o f being e xposed to the
rabbit while relaxing with his snack , Peter w as a ble to hold the ra bbit and p et it while e ating (J ones , 1924).16.2 • T ypes o f Treatment 609

Using this metho d, a p erson cre ates a hierarch y of anxiety , ranging from the le ast-anxiety -pro ducing s timulus

the other p eople in the elev ator, to the f ear o f getting an arm c aught in the do or, to p anic -pro voking situa tions
such as g etting trapp ed or the c able snapping . Next, the therapis t uses progres sive relaxa tion . The y teach
Jayden ho w to relax e ach o f his muscle groups so tha t he achiev es a dro wsy, relax ed, and c omf ortable s tate of
mind . Onc e he ’s in this s tate, the therapis t asks J ayden to ima gine a mildly anxiety -pro voking situa tion . Jayden
is standing in front o f the elev ator thinking a bout pres sing the c all but ton.
If this sc enario c auses J ayden anxiety , he lifts his fing er. The therapis t would then tell J ayden to f orget the
scene and return to his relax ed state. The y rep eat this sc enario o ver and o ver until J ayden c an ima gine himself
pres sing the c all but ton without anxiety . Over time the therapis t and J ayden use progres sive relaxa tion and
ima gina tion to pro ceed through all o f the situa tions on J ayden ’s hierarch y until he b ecomes desensitiz ed to
each one . After this , Jayden and the therapis t begin to practic e wha t he only previously en visione d in therap y,
gradually g oing from pres sing the but ton to actually riding an elev ator. The g oal is tha t Jayden will so on b e able
to tak e the elev ator all the w ay up to the 29th flo or o f his o ffice without f eeling an y anxiety .
Sometimes , it’s too impractic al, expensiv e, or emb arras sing to re -cre ate anxiety - pro ducing situa tions , so a

Psychother apy : Cognitive Ther apy
Cognit ive therap yis a f orm o f psychotherap y tha t focuses on ho w a p erson ’s thoughts le ad to f eelings o f
distres s. The ide a behind c ognitiv e therap y is tha t ho w you think determines ho w you f eel and act . Cognitiv e
therapis ts help their clients chang e dy sfunctional thoughts in order to reliev e dis tres s. The y help a client see
how the y misinterpret a situa tion (c ognitiv e dis tortion). F or e xample , a client ma y overgeneraliz e. Bec ause a
person faile d one tes t in P sycholog y 101, the y feel s tupid and w orthles s. These thoughts then c ause their mo od
to w orsen . Therapis ts also help clients rec ogniz e when the y blo w things out o f prop ortion . Bec ause Ra y faile d

colleg e altog ether . These errors in thinking ha ve contribute d to Ra y’s feelings o f dis tres s. His therapis t will help
him challeng e these irra tional b eliefs , focus on their illogic al basis , and c orrect them with more logic al and
rational thoughts and b eliefs .
Cognitiv e therap y was dev elop ed by ps ychia trist Aaron Beck in the 1960s . His initial f ocus w as on depres sion
and ho w a client ’s self -def eating a ttitude ser ved to maintain a depres sion despite p ositiv e factors in her lif e
(Beck , Rush , Sha w, & Emer y, 1979) ( Figure 16.13 ). Through ques tioning , a c ognitiv e therapis t can help a client
recogniz e dy sfunctional ide as, challeng e catastrophizing thoughts a bout themselv es and their situa tions , and
find a more p ositiv e way to view things (Beck , 2011).

Psychother apy : Cognitive-Behavior al Ther apy
Cognitiv e-behavioral therapis ts focus much more on present is sues than on a p atient ’s childho od or p ast, as in

therap y (RET ), which w as founde d by Albert Ellis and grew out o f his dislik e of Freudian ps ychoanaly sis
(Daniel , n.d.). Beha vioris ts such as J oseph W olpe also influenc ed Ellis’ s therap eutic appro ach (N ational
Association o f Cognitiv e-Beha vioral Therapis ts, 2009).
Cognit ive-beha vioral therap y (CB T)helps clients e xamine ho w their thoughts a ffect their b ehavior . It aims to
chang e cognitiv e dis tortions and self -def eating b ehaviors . In es senc e, this appro ach is designe d to chang e the
way people think as w ell as ho w the y act . It is similar to c ognitiv e therap y in tha t CB T attempts to mak e
individuals a ware o f their irra tional and neg ative thoughts and helps p eople replac e them with new , more
positiv e ways of thinking . It is also similar to b ehavior therapies in tha t CB T te aches p eople ho w to practic e and
engage in more p ositiv e and he alth y appro aches to daily situa tions . In total , hundre ds o f studies ha ve sho wn
the eff ectiv enes s of cognitiv e-behavioral therap y in the tre atment o f numerous ps ychologic al disorders such
as depres sion , PT SD, anxiety disorders , eating disorders , bip olar disorder , and subs tanc e abuse (Beck Ins titute
for C ognitiv e Beha vior Therap y, n.d.). For e xample , CB T has b een f ound to b e eff ectiv e in decre asing lev els o f
hop eles snes s and suicidal thoughts in previously suicidal teena gers (A lavi, Sharifi , Ghanizadeh , & Dehb ozorgi ,
2013). C ognitiv e-behavioral therap y has also b een eff ectiv e in re ducing PT SD in sp ecific p opula tions , such as
transit w orkers (Lo wing er & R omb om, 2012).
Cognitiv e-behavioral therap y aims to chang e cognitiv e dis tortions and self -def eating b ehaviors using
techniques lik e the ABC mo del. With this mo del, there is an Action (sometimes c alled an activ ating ev ent), the
Belief a bout the ev ent, and the Conse quenc es o f this b elief. Let ’s sa y Jon and J oe both g o to a p arty. Jon and J oe
each ha ve met an interes ting p erson a t the p arty and sp end a f ew hours cha tting with them . At the end o f the
party, Jon and J oe ask to e xchang e phone numb ers with the p erson the y've been talking to , and the re ques t is
refuse d. Both J on and J oe are surprise d, as the y thought things w ere g oing w ell. Wha t can J on and J oe tell
themselv es a bout wh y the p erson w as not interes ted? Let ’s sa y Jon tells himself he is a loser , or is ugly , or “has
no g ame .” Jon then g ets depres sed and decides not to g o to another p arty, which s tarts a cy cle tha t keeps him
depres sed. Joe tells himself tha t he had b ad bre ath, goes out and buy s a new to othbr ush , goes to another p arty,
and meets someone new .
Jon’s belief a bout wha t happ ened results in a c onse quenc e of fur ther depres sion , where as Joe’s belief do es not .
Jon is internalizing the a ttribution or re ason f or the rebuffs , which trigg ers his depres sion . On the other hand ,
Joe is e xternalizing the c ause, so his thinking do es not c ontribute to f eelings o f depres sion . Cognitiv e-
behavioral therap y examines sp ecific maladaptiv e and a utoma tic thoughts and c ognitiv e dis tortions . Some
examples o f cognitiv e dis tortions are all-or -nothing thinking , overgeneraliza tion , and jumping to c onclusions .
In o vergeneraliza tion , someone tak es a small situa tion and mak es it hug e—for e xample , ins tead o f saying ,
“This p articular p erson w as not interes ted in me ,” the man sa ys, “I am ugly , a loser , and no one is ev er g oing to
be interes ted in me .”
All or nothing thinking , which is a c ommon typ e of cognitiv e dis tortion f or p eople suff ering from depres sion ,
reflects e xtremes . In other w ords , everything is black or white . After b eing turne d do wn f or a da te, Jon b egins
to think , “No woman will ev er g o out with me . I’m going to b e alone f orev er.” He b egins to f eel anxious and sad
as he c ontempla tes his future .
The third kind o f dis tortion in volves jumping to c onclusions —as suming tha t people are thinking neg atively
about y ou or re acting neg atively to y ou, even though there is no evidenc e. Consider the e xample o f Savannah
and Hillaire , who rec ently met a t a p arty. The y ha ve a lot in c ommon , and Sa vannah thinks the y could b ecome
friends . She c alls Hillaire to in vite her f or c offee. Sinc e Hillaire do esn’t ans wer, Savannah le aves her a mes sage.
Several da ys go by and Sa vannah nev er he ars b ack from her p otential new friend . Ma ybe Hillaire nev er
received the mes sage because she los t her phone or she is to o bus y to return the phone c all. But if Sa vannah
believ es tha t Hillaire didn ’t lik e Sa vannah or didn ’t want to b e her friend , she is demons trating the c ognitiv e
distortion o f jumping to c onclusions .
How eff ectiv e is CB T? One client said this a bout his c ognitiv e-behavioral therap y:16.2 • T ypes o f Treatment 613

Psychother apy : Humanistic Ther apy
Humanis tic ps ycholog y focuses on helping p eople achiev e their p otential . So it mak es sense tha t the g oal of
humanis tic therap yis to help p eople b ecome more self -aware and ac cepting o f themselv es. In c ontras t to
psychoanaly sis, humanis tic therapis ts focus on c onscious ra ther than unc onscious thoughts . The y also
emphasiz e the p atient ’s present and future , as opp osed to e xploring the p atient ’s past.
Psychologis t CarlRogersdevelop ed a therap eutic orienta tion kno wn as Rogerian , orclient -centere d therap y.
Note the chang e from patients toclients . Rogers (1951) f elt tha t the term p atient sugg ested the p erson seeking
help w as sick and lo oking f or a cure . Sinc e this is a f orm o fnondirect ive therap y, a therap eutic appro ach in
which the therapis t do es not giv e advic e or pro vide interpreta tions but helps the p erson to identif y conflicts
and unders tand f eelings , Rogers (1951) emphasiz ed the imp ortanc e of the p erson taking c ontrol o f his o wn lif e
to overcome lif e’s challeng es.
In client -centere d therap y, the therapis t uses the technique o f activ e lis tening . In activ e lis tening , the therapis t
ackno wledges, res tates, and clarifies wha t the client e xpres ses. Therapis ts also practic e wha t Rogers c alled
unc ondit ional p osit ive reg ard, which in volves not judging clients and simply ac cepting them f or who the y
are. Rogers (1951) also f elt tha t therapis ts should demons trate genuinenes s, emp athy, and ac ceptanc e toward
their clients b ecause this helps p eople b ecome more ac cepting o f themselv es, which results in p ersonal
growth .
Evaluating V arious F orms of Psychother apy
How can w e as sess the eff ectiv enes s of psychotherap y? Is one technique more eff ectiv e than another? F or
anyone c onsidering therap y, these are imp ortant ques tions . According to the Americ an P sychologic al
Association , three factors w ork tog ether to pro duce suc cessful tre atment . The firs t is the use o f evidenc e-based
treatment tha t is deeme d appropria te for y our p articular is sue. The sec ond imp ortant factor is the clinic al
expertise o f the ps ychologis t or therapis t. The third factor is y our o wn characteris tics, values , pref erenc es, and
culture . Man y people b egin ps ychotherap y feeling lik e their problem will nev er b e resolv ed; ho wever,
psychotherap y helps p eople see tha t the y can do things to mak e their situa tion b etter. Psychotherap y can help
reduce a p erson ’s anxiety , depres sion , and maladaptiv e behaviors . Through ps ychotherap y, individuals c an
learn to eng age in he alth y behaviors designe d to help them b etter e xpres s emotions , impro ve rela tionships ,
think more p ositiv ely, and p erform more eff ectiv ely a t work or scho ol.
Man y studies ha ve explore d the eff ectiv enes s of psychotherap y. For e xample , one larg e-scale s tudy tha t
examine d 16 meta-analy ses o f CB T rep orted tha t it w as e qually eff ectiv e or more eff ectiv e than other therapies
in tre ating PT SD, generaliz ed anxiety disorder , depres sion , and so cial phobia (B utlera, Chapmanb , Formanc , &
Becka, 2006). Another s tudy f ound tha t CB T was as eff ectiv e at tre ating depres sion (43% suc cess rate) as
prescription me dication (50% suc cess rate) c omp ared to the plac ebo ra te of 25% (DeR ubeis et al ., 2005).
Another meta-analy sis f ound tha t psychodynamic therap y was also as eff ectiv e at tre ating these typ es o f
psychologic al is sues as CB T (She dler , 2010). Ho wever, no s tudies ha ve found one ps ychotherap eutic appro ach
more eff ectiv e than another (Abb ass, Kisely , & K roenk e, 2006; Chorpita et al ., 2011), nor ha ve the y sho wn an y
rela tionship b etween a client ’s tre atment outc ome and the lev el of the clinician ’s training or e xperienc e614 16 • Ther apy and T reatment
Access for fr ee a t opens tax. org
(Wamp old, 2007). R egardles s of which typ e of psychotherap y an individual cho oses , one critic al factor tha t
determines the suc cess of tre atment is the p erson ’s rela tionship with the ps ychologis t or therapis t.
Biomedical Ther apies
Individuals c an b e prescrib ed biologic ally b ased tre atments or ps ychotropic me dications tha t are use d to tre at
mental disorders . While these are o ften use d in c ombina tion with ps ychotherap y, the y also are tak en b y
individuals not in therap y. This is kno wn as biome dical therap y. Me dications use d to tre at psychologic al
disorders are c alled ps ychotropic me dications and are prescrib ed by me dical do ctors , including ps ychia trists.
In Louisiana and N ew Me xico, psychologis ts are a ble to prescrib e some typ es o f these me dications (Americ an
Psychologic al As sociation , 2014).
Different typ es and clas ses o f me dications are prescrib ed for diff erent disorders . An individual with
depres sion might b e giv en an antidepres sant , an individual with bip olar disorder might b e giv en a mo od
stabiliz er, and an individual with schiz ophrenia might b e giv en an antips ychotic . These me dications tre at the
symptoms o f a ps ychologic al disorder b y altering the lev els or eff ects o f neurotransmit ters . For e xample , each
type of antidepres sant a ffects a diff erent neurotransmit ter, such as S SRI (selectiv e serotonin reuptak e
inhibitor) antidepres sants tha t incre ase the lev el of the neurotransmit ter serotonin , and SNRI (serotonin-
norepinephrine reuptak e inhibitor) antidepres sants tha t incre ase the lev els o f both serotonin and
norepinephrine . The y can help p eople f eel b etter so tha t the y can function on a daily b asis , but the y do not cure
the disorder . Some p eople ma y only nee d to tak e a ps ychotropic me dication f or a shor t perio d of time . Others
with sev ere disorders lik e bip olar disorder or schiz ophrenia ma y nee d to tak e ps ychotropic me dication f or a
long time .
Psychotropic me dications are a p opular tre atment option f or man y typ es o f disorders , and rese arch sugg ests
that the y are mos t eff ectiv e when c ombine d with ps ychotherap y. This is esp ecially tr ue for the mos t common
mental disorders , such as depres sive and anxiety disorders (Cuijp ers et al , 2014). When c onsidering adding
medication as a tre atment option , individuals should kno w tha t some ps ychotropic me dications ha ve very
concerning side eff ects .Table 16.2 shows the c ommonly prescrib ed typ es o f me dications , how the y are use d,
and some of the p otential side eff ects tha t ma y occur.

Another biologic ally b ased tre atment tha t continues to b e use d, although infre quently , iselectro convulsiv e

Evidence-based Pr actice
A buzzw ord in ther apy today is e videnc e-based pr actic e. Ho wever, it’s not a no vel concept but one that has been
used in medicine f or at leas t two decades . Evidenc e-based pr actic e is used t o reduc e err ors in tr eatment
selection b y making clinical decisions based on r esear ch (Sack ett & R osenber g, 1995). In an y case , evidenc e-
based tr eatment is on the rise in the field o f psycholog y. So what is it, and wh y does it mat ter? In an eff ort to
determine which tr eatment methodologies ar e evidenc ed-based, pr ofessional or ganizations such as the
American P sychological As sociation (AP A) ha ve recommended that specific ps ychological tr eatments be used t o
treat c ertain ps ychological disor ders (Chambles s & Ol lendick, 2001). Ac cording t o the AP A (2005), “Evidenc e-
based pr actic e in ps ycholog y (EBPP) is the int egration o f the bes t available r esear ch with clinical e xper tise in the
context of patient char acteristics, cul ture, and pr eferences” (p . 1).
The f oundational idea behind e videnc e based tr eatment is that bes t practic es ar e det ermined b y resear ch
evidenc e that has been c ompiled b y comparing v arious f orms o f treatment (Charman & Barkham, 2005). These
treatments ar e then oper ationaliz ed and plac ed in tr eatment manuals —trained ther apis ts follow these manuals .
The benefits ar e that e videnc e-based tr eatment can r educ e variability betw een ther apis ts to ensur e that a
specific appr oach is deliv ered with int egrity (Charman & Barkham, 2005). Ther efore, clients ha ve a higher chanc e
of receiving ther apeutic int erventions that ar e eff ectiv e at tr eating their specific disor der. While EBPP is based on
randomiz ed c ontr ol trials , critics o f EBPP r eject it s tating that the r esul ts of trials cannot be applied t o individuals
and ins tead det erminations r egarding tr eatment should be based on a ther apis t’s judgment (Mul len & Str einer ,
2004).
16.3 Treatment Modalities
LEARNING OBJEC TIVES
By the end o f this section, y ou wil l be able t o:
•Distinguish betw een the v arious modalities o f treatment
•Discus s benefits o f group ther apy
Onc e a p erson seeks tre atment , whether v oluntarily or in voluntarily , the y ha ve an intak edone to as sess their
clinic al nee ds. An intak e is the therapis t’s firs t meeting with the client . The therapis t gathers sp ecific
informa tion to addres s the client ’s imme diate nee ds, such as the presenting problem , the client ’s supp ort
system , and insuranc e status. The therapis t inf orms the client a bout c onfidentiality , fees, and wha t to e xpect in
treatment .Confident ialit ymeans the therapis t cannot disclose c onfidential c ommunic ations to an y third
party unles s manda ted or p ermit ted by law to do so . During the intak e, the therapis t and client will w ork
together to discus s tre atment g oals. Then a tre atment plan will b e formula ted, usually with sp ecific
measura ble objectiv es. Also, the therapis t and client will discus s ho w tre atment suc cess will b e me asure d and
the es tima ted length o f tre atment . There are sev eral diff erent mo dalities o f tre atment ( Figure 16.14 ):
Individual therap y, family therap y, couples therap y, and group therap y are the mos t common .DIG DEEPER16.3 • T reatment Modalities 617

Individual Ther apy
Inindividual therap y, also kno wn as individual ps ychotherap y or individual c ounseling , the client and
clinician meet one -on-one (usually from 45 minutes to 1 hour). These meetings typic ally o ccur w eekly or ev ery
other w eek, and ses sions are c onducte d in a c onfidential and c aring en vironment ( Figure 16.15 ). The clinician
will w ork with clients to help them e xplore their f eelings , work through lif e challeng es, identif y asp ects o f
themselv es and their liv es tha t the y wish to chang e, and set g oals to help them w ork to wards these chang es. A
client might see a clinician f or only a f ew ses sions , or the client ma y attend individual therap y ses sions f or a
year or long er. The amount o f time sp ent in therap y dep ends on the nee ds o f the client as w ell as her p ersonal
goals.

Clea ver)
Group Ther apy
Ingroup therap y, a clinician meets tog ether with sev eral clients with similar problems ( Figure 16.16 ). When
children are plac ed in group therap y, it is p articularly imp ortant to ma tch clients f or a ge and problems . One
benefit o f group therap y is tha t it c an help decre ase a client ’s shame and isola tion a bout a problem while
offering nee ded supp ort, both from the therapis t and other memb ers o f the group (Americ an P sychologic al
Association , 2014). A nine -year-old se xual a buse victim , for e xample , ma y feel v ery emb arras sed and
ashame d. If he is plac ed in a group with other se xually a buse d boys, he will re alize tha t he is not alone . A child

skills . A w oman suff ering from p ost-partum depres sion c ould f eel les s guilty and more supp orted by being in a
group with similar w omen .
Group therap y also has some sp ecific limita tions . Memb ers o f the group ma y be afraid to sp eak in front o f
other p eople b ecause sharing secrets and problems with c omplete s trang ers c an b e stres sful and
overwhelming . There ma y be personality clashes and arguments among group memb ers. There c ould also b e
concerns a bout c onfidentiality: Someone from the group might share wha t another p articip ant said to p eople
outside o f the group .
FIGURE 16.16 In gr oup ther apy, usual ly 5–10 people meet with a tr ained ther apis t to discus s a c ommon is sue such
as div orce, grief , an eating disor der, subs tanc e abuse , or ang er manag ement. (cr edit: Cor y Zank er)
Another b enefit o f group therap y is tha t memb ers c an c onfront e ach other a bout their p atterns . For those with
some typ es o f problems , such as se xual a busers , group therap y is the rec ommende d tre atment . Group
treatment f or this p opula tion is c onsidere d to ha ve sev eral b enefits:
Group tre atment is more ec onomic al than individual , couples , or family therap y. Sexual a busers o ften
feel more c omf ortable admit ting and discus sing their o ffenses in a tre atment group where others are
modeling op ennes s. Clients o ften ac cept f eedback a bout their b ehavior more willingly from other
group memb ers than from therapis ts. Finally , clients c an practic e so cial skills in group tre atment
settings . (McGra th, Cumming , Burchard , Zeoli, & Ellerb y, 2009)
Groups tha t ha ve a s trong e ducational c omp onent are c alled ps ycho-educ ational groups . For e xample , a group
for children whose p arents ha ve cancer might discus s in depth wha t cancer is , typ es o f tre atment f or c ancer,
and the side eff ects o f tre atments , such as hair los s. Often , group therap y ses sions with children tak e plac e in
scho ol. The y are le d by a scho ol counselor , a scho ol ps ychologis t, or a scho ol so cial w orker. Groups might f ocus
on tes t anxiety , social isola tion , self -esteem , bullying , or scho ol failure (Shechtman , 2002). Whether the group
is held in scho ol or in a clinician ’s office, group therap y has b een f ound to b e eff ectiv e with children facing
numerous kinds o f challeng es (Shechtman , 2002).
During a group ses sion , the entire group c ould reflect on an individual ’s problem or difficulties , and others
might disclose wha t the y ha ve done in tha t situa tion . When a clinician is facilita ting a group , the f ocus is
always on making sure tha t everyone b enefits and p articip ates in the group and tha t no one p erson is the f ocus
of the entire ses sion . Groups c an b e org aniz ed in v arious w ays: some ha ve an o verarching theme or purp ose,
some are time -limite d, some ha ve op en memb ership tha t allo ws people to c ome and g o, and some are close d.
Some groups are s tructure d with planne d activities and g oals, while others are uns tructure d: There is no
specific plan , and group memb ers themselv es decide ho w the group will sp end its time and on wha t goals it
will f ocus. This c an b ecome a c omple x and emotionally charg ed pro cess, but it is also an opp ortunity f or
personal gro wth (P age & Berk ow, 1994).16.3 • T reatment Modalities 619
Couples Ther apy
Couples therap yinvolves tw o people in an intima te rela tionship who are ha ving difficulties and are tr ying to
resolv e them ( Figure 16.17 ). The c ouple ma y be da ting , partnere d, eng aged, or marrie d. The primar y
therap eutic orienta tion use d in c ouples c ounseling is c ognitiv e-behavioral therap y (Ra thus & Sanderson ,
1999). C ouples meet with a therapis t to discus s conflicts and/or asp ects o f their rela tionship tha t the y want to
chang e. The therapis t helps them see ho w their individual b ackgrounds , beliefs , and actions are a ffecting their
rela tionship . Often , a therapis t tries to help the c ouple resolv e these problems , as w ell as implement s trategies
that will le ad to a he althier and happier rela tionship , such as ho w to lis ten, how to argue , and ho w to e xpres s
feelings . Ho wever, sometimes , after w orking with a therapis t, a c ouple will re alize tha t the y are to o
incomp atible and will decide to sep arate. Some c ouples seek therap y to w ork out their problems , while others
attend therap y to determine whether s taying tog ether is the b est solution . Counseling c ouples in a high-
conflict and v olatile rela tionship c an b e difficult . In fact , psychologis ts Peter P earson and Ellyn Bader , who
founde d the C ouples Ins titute in P alo A lto, California, ha ve comp ared the e xperienc e of the clinician in
couples’ therap y to b e lik e “piloting a helic opter in a hurric ane” (Weil, 2012, p ara. 7).
FIGURE 16.17 In couples c ounseling , a ther apis t helps people w ork on their r elationship . (credit: Cor y Zank er)
Family Ther apy
Family therap yis a sp ecial f orm o f group therap y, consis ting o f one or more families . Although there are man y
theoretic al orienta tions in family therap y, one o f the mos t pre dominant is the s ystems appro ach. The family is
view ed as an org aniz ed system , and e ach individual within the family is a c ontributing memb er who cre ates
and maintains pro cesses within the s ystem tha t shap e behavior (Minuchin , 1985). Each memb er o f the family
influenc es and is influenc ed by the others . The g oal of this appro ach is to enhanc e the gro wth o f each family
memb er as w ell as tha t of the family as a whole .
Often , dysfunctional p atterns o f communic ation tha t dev elop b etween family memb ers c an le ad to c onflict . A
family with this dynamic might wish to a ttend therap y tog ether ra ther than individually . In man y cases , one
memb er o f the family has problems tha t detrimentally a ffect ev eryone. For e xample , a mother ’s depres sion ,
teen da ughter ’s eating disorder , or fa ther ’s alc ohol dep endenc e could a ffect all memb ers o f the family . The
therapis t would w ork with all memb ers o f the family to help them c ope with the is sue, and to enc oura ge
resolution and gro wth in the c ase o f the individual family memb er with the problem .
With family therap y, the nucle ar family (i .e., parents and children) or the nucle ar family plus who ever liv es in
the household (e .g., grandp arent) c ome into tre atment . Family therapis ts w ork with the whole family unit to
heal the family . There are sev eral diff erent typ es o f family therap y. Instructural f amily therap y, the therapis t620 16 • Ther apy and T reatment

examines and discus ses the b oundaries and s tructure o f the family: who mak es the r ules , who sleeps in the

parents do not w ork tog ether to mak e rules , or one p arent ma y undermine the other , leading the children to act

Addiction is o ften view ed as a chronic dise ase ( Figure 16.18 ). The choic e to use a subs tanc e is initially
voluntar y; ho wever, because chronic subs tanc e use c an p ermanently alter the neural s tructure in the
prefrontal c ortex, an are a of the brain as sociated with decision-making and judgment , a p erson b ecomes
driv en to use dr ugs and/or alc ohol (Muño z-Cuev as, Athiling am, Pisc opo, & W ilbrecht , 2013). This helps e xplain
why relapse ra tes tend to b e high . Ab out 40%–60% o f individuals relapse , which me ans the y return to a busing

Specific factors mak e subs tanc e-rela ted tre atment much more eff ectiv e. One factor is dura tion o f tre atment .
Generally , a p erson with addict nee ds to b e in tre atment f or a t least three months to achiev e a p ositiv e
outc ome (Simpson , 1981; Simpson , Joe, & Bracy , 1982; NID A, 2012). This is due to the ps ychologic al,
physiologic al, behavioral , and so cial asp ects o f abuse (Simpson , 1981; Simpson et al ., 1982; NID A, 2012).
While in tre atment , a p erson with addiction might rec eive behavior therap y, which c an help motiv ate the
person with addiction to p articip ate in the tre atment program and te ach s trategies f or de aling with cra vings
and ho w to prev ent relapse . Also, tre atment nee ds to b e holis tic and addres s multiple nee ds, not jus t the dr ug
addiction . This me ans tha t tre atment will addres s factors such as c ommunic ation , stres s mana gement ,
rela tionship is sues , parenting , vocational c oncerns , and leg al concerns (McGo vern & C arroll , 2003; NID A,
2012).
While individual therap y is use d in the tre atment o f subs tanc e-rela ted disorders , group therap y is the mos t
widespre ad tre atment mo dality ( Weiss, Jaffee, de Menil , & C ogle y, 2004). The ra tionale b ehind using group
therap y for addiction tre atment is tha t people with addiction are much more lik ely to maintain sobriety in a
group f orma t. It has b een sugg ested tha t this is due to the rew arding and therap eutic b enefits o f the group ,
such as supp ort, affilia tion , identific ation , and ev en c onfronta tion (C enter f or Subs tanc e Abuse T reatment ,
2005). F or teena gers, the whole family o ften nee ds to p articip ate in tre atment to addres s issues such as family
dynamics , communic ation , and relapse prev ention . Family in volvement in teen dr ug addiction is vital .
Research sugg ests tha t gre ater p arental in volvement is c orrela ted with a gre ater re duction in use b y teen
subs tanc e abusers . Also, mothers who p articip ated in tre atment displa yed better mental he alth and gre ater
warmth to ward their children (Ber trand et al ., 2013). Ho wever, neither individual nor group therap y has b een
found to b e more eff ectiv e (Weiss et al ., 2004). R egardles s of the typ e of tre atment ser vice, the primar y focus is
on a bstinenc e or a t the v ery least a signific ant re duction in use (McGo vern & C arroll , 2003).
Treatment also usually in volves me dications to deto x a p erson with addiction sa fely a fter an o verdose , to

Comorbid Disor ders
Frequently , a p erson with an addiction to dr ugs and/or alc ohol has an additional ps ychologic al disorder . Saying
a person has comorbid disorders means the individual has tw o or more dia gnoses . This c an o ften b e a
subs tanc e-rela ted dia gnosis and another ps ychia tric dia gnosis , such as depres sion , bip olar disorder , or
schiz ophrenia. These individuals fall into the c ategory of mentally ill and chemic ally addicte d (MIC A)—their
problems are o ften chronic and e xpensiv e to tre at, with limite d suc cess. Comp ared with the o verall p opula tion ,
people who use illicit dr ugs or misuse prescription dr ugs are twic e as lik ely to ha ve a mo od or anxiety disorder .
Drug use c an c ause s ymptoms o f mo od and anxiety disorders and the rev erse is also tr ue—people with
debilita ting s ymptoms o f a ps ychia tric disorder ma y self -me dicate and misuse subs tanc es.
In cases o fcomorbidity , the b est tre atment is thought to addres s both (or multiple) disorders simultaneously
(NID A, 2012). Beha vior therapies are use d to tre at comorbid c onditions , and in man y cases , psychotropic
medications are use d along with ps ychotherap y. For e xample , evidenc e sugg ests tha t bupropion (trade names:
Wellbutrin and Z yban), appro ved for tre ating depres sion and nic otine dep endenc e, might also help re duce
craving and use o f the dr ug methamphetamine (NID A, 2011). Ho wever, more rese arch is nee ded to b etter
unders tand ho w these me dications w ork—particularly when c ombine d in p atients with c omorbidities .

•Discus s barriers t o mental heal th ser vices among ethnic minorities
The so ciocultural p ersp ectiv e looks a t you, your b ehaviors , and y our s ymptoms in the c onte xt of your culture
and b ackground . For e xample , José is an 18- year-old Hisp anic male from a traditional family . José c omes to
treatment b ecause o f depres sion . During the intak e ses sion , he rev eals tha t he is g ay and is ner vous a bout
telling his family . He also discloses tha t he is c oncerne d because his religious b ackground has ta ught him tha t
being g ay is wrong . Ho w do es his religious and cultural b ackground a ffect him? Ho w might his cultural
background a ffect ho w his family re acts if J osé w ere to tell them he is g ay?
Mental he alth pro fessionals mus t dev elop cultural c omp etenc e(Figure 16.20 ), which me ans the y mus t

addres s the nee ds o f various p opula tions f or which Euro centric therapies ha ve limite d applic ation (Sue , 2004).
For e xample , a c ounselor whose tre atment f ocuses on individual decision making ma y be ineff ectiv e at helping
a Chinese client with a c ollectivis t appro ach to problem solving (Sue , 2004).
Multicultural c ounseling and therap y aims to o ffer b oth a helping role and pro cess tha t uses mo dalities and
defines g oals c onsis tent with the lif e experienc es and cultural v alues o f clients . It s trives to rec ogniz e client
identities to include individual , group , and univ ersal dimensions , adv ocate the use o f univ ersal and culture -
specific s trategies and roles in the he aling pro cess, and b alanc es the imp ortanc e of individualism and
collectivism in the as sessment , dia gnosis , and tre atment o f client and client s ystems (Sue , 2001).
This therap eutic p ersp ectiv e integra tes the imp act o f cultural and so cial norms , starting a t the b eginning o f

their cultural p atterns into a unique tre atment appro ach b ased on their p articular situa tion (Stew art,
Simmons , & Ha bibp our, 2012). So ciocultural therap y can include individual , group , family , and c ouples
treatment mo dalities .

Barriers to T reatment
Statistically, ethnic minorities tend to utiliz e mental he alth ser vices les s fre quently than White , middle -clas s
Americ ans (A legría et al ., 2008; Richman , Kohn-W ood, & W illiams , 2007). Wh y is this so? P erhaps the re ason
has to do with ac cess and a vailability o f mental he alth ser vices. Ethnic minorities and individuals o f low
socioeconomic s tatus (SES ) rep ort tha t barriers to ser vices include lack o f insuranc e, transp ortation , and time
(Thomas & Sno wden , 2002). Ho wever, rese archers ha ve found tha t even when inc ome lev els and insuranc e
varia bles are tak en into ac count , ethnic minorities are far les s lik ely to seek out and utiliz e mental he alth
services. And when ac cess to mental he alth ser vices is c omp arable acros s ethnic and racial groups , diff erenc es
in ser vice utiliza tion remain (Richman et al ., 2007).
In a s tudy in volving thousands o f women , it w as found tha t the prev alenc e ra te of anore xia w as similar acros s
different rac es, but tha t bulimia ner vosa w as more prev alent among Hisp anic and Afric an Americ an w omen
when c omp ared with non-Hisp anic White p eople (Marques et al ., 2011). A lthough the y ha ve similar or higher
rates o f eating disorders , Hisp anic and Afric an Americ an w omen with these disorders tend to seek and eng age
in tre atment far les s than White w omen . These findings sugg est ethnic disp arities in ac cess to c are, as w ell as
clinic al and ref erral practic es tha t ma y prev ent Hisp anic and Afric an Americ an w omen from rec eiving c are,
which c ould include lack o f bilingual tre atment , stigma, f ear o f not b eing unders tood, family priv acy, and lack
of education a bout e ating disorders .
Perceptions and a ttitudes to ward mental he alth ser vices ma y also c ontribute to this imb alanc e. A rec ent s tudy
at King ’s Colleg e, London , found man y comple x re asons wh y people do not seek tre atment: self -sufficiency and
not seeing the nee d for help , not seeing therap y as eff ectiv e, concerns a bout c onfidentiality , and the man y
effects o f stigma and shame (Clement et al ., 2014). And in another s tudy , Afric an Americ ans e xhibiting
depres sion w ere les s willing to seek tre atment due to f ear o f possible ps ychia tric hospitaliza tion as w ell as f ear
of the tre atment itself (Sus sman , Robins , & Earls , 1987). Ins tead o f mental he alth tre atment , man y Afric an
Americ ans pref er to b e self -reliant or use spiritual practic es (Sno wden , 2001; Belgra ve & A llison , 2010). F or

physical w ell-b eing o f its memb ers (Blank , Mahmo od, Fox, & Guterb ock, 2002).
Additionally , people b elonging to ethnic groups tha t alre ady rep ort concerns a bout prejudic e and
discrimina tion are les s lik ely to seek ser vices for a mental illnes s because the y view it as an additional s tigma
(Gary, 2005; T ownes , Cunningham , & Cha vez-Korell , 2009; Sc ott, McC oy, Munson , Sno wden , & McMillen ,
2011). F or e xample , in one rec ent s tudy o f 462 older K orean Americ ans (o ver the a ge of 60) man y particip ants
reported suff ering from depres sive symptoms . Ho wever, 71% indic ated the y thought depres sion w as a sign o f
personal w eaknes s, and 14% rep orted tha t ha ving a mentally ill family memb er w ould bring shame to the
family (J ang , Chirib oga, & Okazaki , 2009).
Langua ge diff erenc es are a fur ther b arrier to tre atment . In the previous s tudy on K orean Americ ans’ a ttitudes
toward mental he alth ser vices, it w as found tha t there w ere no K orean-sp eaking mental he alth pro fessionals
where the s tudy w as c onducte d (Orlando and T amp a, Florida) (J ang et al ., 2009). Bec ause o f the gro wing
numb er o f people from ethnic ally div erse b ackgrounds , there is a nee d for therapis ts and ps ychologis ts to
develop kno wledge and skills to b ecome culturally c omp etent (A hme d, Wilson , Henriksen , & J ones , 2011).
Those pro viding therap y mus t appro ach the pro cess from the c onte xt of the unique culture o f each client (Sue
& Sue , 2007).
Supporting Mental Health T reatment
In the Unit ed Stat es, about one in six childr en and one in fiv e adul ts experienc es a mental heal th disor der, but
fewer than half o f these people r eceive professional suppor t for their disor der ( Whitne y & P eterson, 2019).
Access to qualified mental heal th pr ofessionals is not univ ersal or equitable , but it has impr oved to the point that
mor e people c ould r eceive help if the y sought it. Wh y then, do so man y people g o without suppor t, ther apy, or
treatment?
It seems that the public has a neg ative per ception o f people with mental heal th disor ders . According t o
resear chers fr om Indiana Univ ersity , the Univ ersity o f Virginia , and Columbia Univ ersity , interviews with o ver
1,300 U .S. adul ts sho w that the y belie ve childr en with depr ession ar e prone t o violenc e and that if a child
receives tr eatment f or a ps ychological disor der, then that child is mor e lik ely to be r eject ed b y peers at school .
Bernic e Pescosolido , author o f the s tudy , asserts that this is a misc onception. And it is not limit ed to per ceptions
of mental heal th is sues in childr en: adul ts living with mental heal th is sues ma y fac e even mor e scrutin y when
sharing their c ondition or seeking suppor t. Stigmatization o f psychological disor ders is one o f the main r easons
why people do not g et the help the y need when the y are ha ving difficul ties. Pescosolido and her c olleag ues
caution that this s tigma surr ounding mental il lnes s, based on misc onceptions r ather than facts , can be
devastating t o emotional and social w ell-being .
Fortunat ely, we are starting t o see discus sions r elated to the des tigmatization o f mental il lnes s and an incr ease
in public education and a warenes s. Dozens o f leaders ha ve contribut ed to the c onversation, including athlet es
like Naomi Osak a, Simone Biles , Michael Phelps , Kevin L ove, and Dak P rescott, as w ell as ar tists such as Adele ,
Bruc e Springs teen, Ariana Gr ande , Big Sean, and Bebe R exha. Mental heal th awarenes s is s tronger within
workplac es, educational set tings , and c ommunities o verall. Ho wever, stigma r emains , par ticularl y regarding
mental heal th is sues that ar e frequentl y misunders tood.
The National Al lianc e on Mental Il lnes s (NAMI) outlines k ey consider ations r egarding suppor t, sensitivity , and
compas sion r egarding mental heal th:
•Talk and lis ten openl y about mental heal th: if y ou ar e confident and c omfortable sharing y our o wn mental
heal th story, you ma y help someone else . Likewise , if y ou ar e comfortable learning about someone 'sDIG DEEPER16.5 • The Sociocul tural Model and Ther apy Utiliza tion 625
experienc e, the y ma y appr eciat e a friendl y and suppor tive ear .
•Avoid as sump tions , gener alizations , or judgments: people e xperienc e mental heal th diff erently, even if the y
have the same s ymp toms or diagnosis as another person. Al though y ou ma y ha ve the bes t intentions , it is
usual ly not help ful to act as if y ou kno w ho w the y feel or kno w ho w the y should handle their c ondition.
•Be c onscious o f lang uage: using appr opriat e lang uage creates a mor e welcoming and c omfortable
environment and r educ es bias . Avoid lang uage that s tigmatiz es, blames , or disc ourages people based on
their or their famil y member 's mental heal th.
•Encourage equality r egarding mental and ph ysical il lnes s, so that people r ecogniz e the nec essity o f
addr essing and tr eating both.
•Encourage people t o get help if the y need it: firs t steps can include speaking t o a doct or or c ounselor , or
attending a suppor t group meeting .
Managing mental heal th and addr essing mental il lnes s can be e xtremel y chal lenging and painful , and ma y
sometimes seem futile and c onfusing . As w e mention abo ve, a significant number o f people ha ve experienc ed
mental heal th pr oblems , and it is in al l of our int erests to impr ove wellbeing . With gr eater awarenes s and
unders tanding , we wil l incr ease their capacity f or bet ter heal th and r ecovery, creating mor e productiv e and
suppor tive communities , families , and r elationships .

Summary
16.1 Mental Health T reatment: P ast and Pr esent
It was onc e believ ed tha t people with ps ychologic al disorders , or those e xhibiting s trang e behavior , were
possessed by demons . These p eople w ere f orced to tak e part in e xorcisms , were imprisone d, or e xecute d.
Later, asylums w ere built to house the mentally ill , but the p atients rec eived lit tle to no tre atment , and man y of
the metho ds use d were cr uel. Philipp e Pinel and Dorothe a Dix argue d for more humane tre atment o f people
with ps ychologic al disorders . In the mid-1960s , the deins titutionaliza tion mo vement g aine d supp ort and
asylums w ere close d, ena bling p eople with mental illnes s to return home and rec eive tre atment in their o wn
communities . Some did g o to their family homes , but man y became homeles s due to a lack o f resourc es and
supp ort mechanisms .
Today, ins tead o f asylums , there are ps ychia tric hospitals r un b y state governments and lo cal community
hospitals , with the emphasis on shor t-term s tays. Ho wever, mos t people who ha ve mental illnes s are not
hospitaliz ed. A p erson suff ering s ymptoms c ould sp eak with a primar y care ph ysician , who mos t lik ely w ould
refer him to someone who sp ecializ es in therap y. The p erson c an rec eive outp atient mental he alth ser vices
from a v ariety o f sourc es, including ps ychologis ts, psychia trists, marria ge and family therapis ts, scho ol
counselors , clinic al so cial w orkers, and religious p ersonnel . These therap y ses sions w ould b e covered through
insuranc e, government funds , or priv ate (self ) pay.
16.2 Types of T reatment
Psychoanaly sis w as dev elop ed by Sigmund F reud . Freud ’s theor y is tha t a p erson ’s ps ychologic al problems are
the result o f repres sed impulses or childho od tra uma. The g oal of the therapis t is to help a p erson unc over
burie d feelings b y using techniques such as free as sociation and dre am analy sis.
Play therap y is a ps ychodynamic therap y technique o ften use d with children . The ide a is tha t children pla y out
their hop es, fantasies , and tra umas , using dolls , stuffed animals , and sandb ox figurines .
In b ehavior therap y, a therapis t emplo ys principles o f learning from clas sical and op erant c onditioning to help
clients chang e undesira ble b ehaviors . Counterc onditioning is a c ommonly use d therap eutic technique in628 16 • Summar y

which a client le arns a new resp onse to a s timulus tha t has previously elicite d an undesira ble b ehavior via
clas sical conditioning . Principles o f op erant c onditioning c an b e applie d to help p eople de al with a wide rang e
of psychologic al problems . Token ec onom y is an e xample o f a p opular op erant c onditioning technique .
Cognitiv e therap y is a technique tha t focuses on ho w thoughts le ad to f eelings o f dis tres s. The ide a behind
cognitiv e therap y is tha t ho w you think determines ho w you f eel and act . Cognitiv e therapis ts help clients
chang e dy sfunctional thoughts in order to reliev e dis tres s. Cognitiv e-behavioral therap y explores ho w our
thoughts a ffect our b ehavior . Cognitiv e-behavioral therap y aims to chang e cognitiv e dis tortions and self -
defeating b ehaviors .
Humanis tic therap y focuses on helping p eople achiev e their p otential . One f orm o f humanis tic therap y
develop ed by Carl R ogers is kno wn as client -centere d or R ogerian therap y. Client -centere d therapis ts use the
techniques o f activ e lis tening , unc onditional p ositiv e reg ard, genuinenes s, and emp athy to help clients
become more ac cepting o f themselv es.
Often in c ombina tion with ps ychotherap y, people c an b e prescrib ed biologic ally b ased tre atments such as
psychotropic me dications and/or other me dical pro cedures such as electro -convulsiv e therap y.
16.3 Treatment Modalities
There are sev eral mo dalities o f tre atment: individual therap y, group therap y, couples therap y, and family
therap y are the mos t common . In an individual therap y ses sion , a client w orks one -on-one with a traine d
therapis t. In group therap y, usually 5–10 p eople meet with a traine d group therapis t to discus s a c ommon
issue (e .g., div orce, grief, e ating disorders , subs tanc e abuse , or ang er mana gement). C ouples therap y involves
two people in an intima te rela tionship who are ha ving difficulties and are tr ying to resolv e them . The c ouple
may be da ting , partnere d, eng aged, or marrie d. The therapis t helps them resolv e their problems as w ell as
