While he can remember how to play the piano perfectly, he cannot rememberwhat he ate for breakfast just an hour ago (Sacks, 2007). James Wannerton experiences a taste sensation that isassociated with the sound of words. His former girlfriend’s name tastes like rhubarb (Mundasad, 2013). JohnNash is a brilliant mathematician and Nobel Prize winner. However, while he was a professor at MIT, he wouldtell people that the New York Timescontained coded messages from extraterrestrial beings that were intendedfor him. He also began to hear voices and became suspicious of the people around him. Soon thereafter, Nashwas diagnosed with schizophrenia and admitted to a state-run mental institution (O’Connor & Robertson,'}"
